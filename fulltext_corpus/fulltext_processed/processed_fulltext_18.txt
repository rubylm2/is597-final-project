 chancellor although punctuated by knowledge milestones learning does not end at an outcome nor is it always evidenced in performance rather learning occurs through the course of connected experiences in which knowledge is modified and re formed as dewey suggested education must be conceived as a continuing reconstruction of experience    the process and goal of education are one and the same thing p  dewey further described some experiences as mis educative if they have the effect of arresting or distorting the growth of further experience for example a student who concludes from a negative experience while studying abroad that all people from a host country are rude has had a mis educative experience the student has not benefitted from experiential education which involves the transformation of experience into knowledge which is then applied and tested through action kolb  the national society for experiential education nsee has proposed the following basic principles of good practice intention authenticity planning clarity monitoring and assessment reflection evaluation and acknowledgment nsee  these ideologies may serve as crucial elements of experiential education and study abroad global study abroad programs have changed how we think about the classroom while the concept of the global classroom is conceived to connect educators and students across the world using technology schisa et al  the authors posits that the idea of the global classroom can occur anywhere learning occursnationally or globally for instance a global classroom can be at the forum in rome or at the eiffel tower in paris in other words the global classroom provides opportunities for students to gain knowledge exposure and experience and to think beyond the confines of geographic boundaries when teaching a study abroad program it is important to use a variety of instructional methods and activities that include lectures discussions site visits presentations from professionals from the host country and collaborative learning opportunities i found these strategies to be effective in italy mcelroy and bridges  suggest the following questions when planning your course  what are your expectations for student behavior what are their expectations for you how will you build community in the classroom and outside  how will you accommodate unexpected developments eg if a planned activity is canceled a new topic of interest emerges  how will you assess student learning or the overall success of your program what reporting is required by your institution critical thinking skills are essential learning objectives for students when designing your study abroad course   chancellorindd    am
