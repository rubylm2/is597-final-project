comment science and nonscience in qualitative research a response to thomas and nyce alan r sandstrom and pamela effrein sandstrom in their reaction to our article the use and misuse of anthropological methods in library and information science research nancy p thomas and james m nyce accuse us of promulgating a single science that they would like to replace with a broader more inclusive epistemology   while in their eyes we stand guilty of the reduction of science and ethnography they demonstrate their tolerance and ecumenical spirit by recommending that approaches such as discourse analysis should have a central place in scientific investigation we strongly disagree with both their characterization of our work and their recommendations even a cursory reading of our article reveals that we do not reduce science in fact we work hard to expand it beyond the narrow confines often ascribed to it by the antiscience crowd we describe an inclusive approach to using scientific ethnography to investigate human thought and behavior while appearing to broaden science thomas and nyce are in fact blurring the distinction between science and nonscience in the study of human beings rather than increase the reach of scientific method they undermine the very systematicity and rigor in research they claim to value they cannot admit that they reject science outright but this in effect is precisely what they do we hope that library and information science lis researchers will see through the hidden agenda of thomas and nyce and avoid the radical relativism that lies at the heart of their program although failing to identify themselves as such thomas and nyce clearly fall in with the general category of postmodern or social constructionist critics of science that we refer to in our article like postmodernists in general they are long on rhetoric and short on specifics they do not define discourse analysis show how it would be of use to lis researchers or provide a single example of why this approach is superior to the scientific ethnography that we outline in our article no mention is made about how we are to evaluate one discourse analysis over another are all such analyses of equal value we are left wondering how such an approach can produce knowledge that is both valid and reliable and why it should replace scientific ethnography that has proven its success over the decades if they intend discourse analysis to supplement scientific work they do not specify how this would be accomplished in the terminology of scientific ethnography thomas and nyce presumably are interested in emic data what about the etic perspective on social interaction do they presume that merely revealing what is in people heads for example values and worldview or the hidden biases of analysts who write about library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
 the library quarterly people behavior provides sufficient grounds to explain social life from the lack of specificity in their response all we can do is guess at the answers to these questions while accusing us of rhetorical ferocity thomas and nyce are not above a touch of ferocity in their own writing they claim that we label critics such as themselves unscrupulous power elites and charlatans they have not read our article what we say is those who would reduce social research merely to thick descriptions of emic states undermine efforts to achieve scientific knowledge of human behavior and leave people vulnerable to unscrupulous power elites and charlatans  p  thomas and nyce characterize our argument as a religious polemic when in fact we defend scientific ethnography against attempts such as theirs to subvert the ability of scientific research to approach an objective understanding of the world we stand accused of being inconsistent and disingenuous when we argue that science is only one way of knowing we are neither inconsistent nor disingenuous in our stance we continue to maintain that there are other ways of knowing but we insist that only by applying scientific methods can we produce knowledge of scientific value religious or aesthetic value must derive from other approaches to the problem of knowledge thomas and nyce write that we appear to limit research to investigations of information seeking in information systems nothing could be farther from the truth we clearly state in our article that scientific ethnography is limited only by the imagination of the researcher they are also disturbed because we select researchers for praise who have kept faith with scientific values while dismissing critics of science the bibliography in our article contains  sources including many that exemplify the antiscience bias that we deplore we quote extensively from these works and try to explain why we are in disagreement with them thomas and nyce reliance on such notorious enemies of rationality and science as paul feyerabend and richard shweder should forewarn readers of the degree to which they have abandoned any hope of systematic knowledge of the social world it is not clear to thomas and nyce to whom we attribute responsibility for the antiscientific thrust of some contemporary advocates of ethnography in our article we clearly identify people like clifford geertz a cultural anthropologist postmodernists and a list of researchers in sociology education and lis who spearhead the antiscience movement gilbert ryle is a philosopher and not a cultural anthropologist as our critics would have it much of the antiscience rhetoric comes from within cultural anthropology itself we fully acknowledge that what we tried to do in our article is to warn lis researchers not to fall for the nihilist despair that has captured some cultural anthropologists who cannot or will not do field ethnography of their own in our reading we found that lis researchers were following the lead of this vocal minority and neglecting traditional scientific ethnography that forms the core of anthropological research we have tried to correct the narrow definition of ethnography one often encounters in lis publications we point out that lis researchers are overlooking the large body of work done in cultural anthropology that they seem to be duplicating in their articles and books anthropologists have been conducting ethnographic research under often trying conditions since the turn of the century why not take advantage of their insights rather than reinvent them the debate between science and nonscience certainly still rages within cultural anthropology see for example recent works that chronicle the struggle   the true postmodernist and antiscientific stance of thomas and nyce is revealed when they attempt to characterize our assumptions about science and ethnography they derisively dismiss our discussion of canons of scientific knowledge the need to strive for objectivity the criterion of replicability in research the need to identify
comment  theoretical and empirical problems the search for laws and the goal of explanation they accuse us of advocating positivistic certainty when everything in our article speaks against such a simplistic formulation they overlook our discussions of probabilistic causation and the goal of approaching an objective view of social life without ever being able to achieve it completely one of our greatest blind spots according to thomas and nyce is our assumption that there is a real world out there which can be discovered providing that appropriately trained researchers apply appropriate methods we fear that we are guilty as charged of this sin but we would like to know exactly what alternative view they offer in its place is it a reality in which every social group determines its own world where we are hopeless prisoners of our tribal group gender social class race and religion is there no way to transcend these provincialisms and with discipline and skill approach an objective view of the world and its inhabitants perhaps a telling criticism of us is that we supposedly eschew a distinction between social facts and natural facts this old distinction traces most recently to the neo kantians of the late nineteenth century and is not directly addressed in our article we think that the human mind and the social and cultural systems that humans create are part of nature and although the study of human beings presents difficulties they can be fruitfully analyzed within a scientific framework for thomas and nyce humans are beyond nature perhaps even supernatural and require nonscientific approaches to get at a deeper truth about them it is an uncomfortable fact that thomas and nyce and their fellow postmodernists come close to being secular creationists for this reason their accusation that our article is a religious polemic takes on a special irony in our article we clearly state that if lis researchers want to reject positivist science take a humanities approach in their work and simply write descriptions that evoke what it means to participate in a social scene that is certainly their right  p   yet thomas and nyce claim that we are trying to impose some golden mean on the field that will stultify the search for answers to fundamental questions we are not concerned that people like thomas and nyce wish to pursue nonscientific research programs they may even produce interesting results but they will not be scientific results what we fear is their apparent intent to replace the scientific approach to ethnography with some amorphous hodgepodge lacking the minimal criteria for scientific research that they readily disparage there are accepted means for doing scientific research and these are not hard to define scientific research remains the best approach to producing valid and reliable information about the social and natural worlds the information it produces is available and of potential use to every human being in the world until they can demonstrate that the approach they advocate offers an advantage over science and that it produces valid and reliable findings about social life not possible through scientific means science should not be abandoned or compromised out of existence the fact is that research findings even from nonscientific approaches will be convincing to the degree that they replicate standard scientific canons of evidence otherwise it is just the author word against everyone else thomas and nyce further display their unfamiliarity with our article by claiming that we relativize both science and the kind of knowledge that it produces apparently according to our critics we simultaneously reduce and narrow science to the point where it cannot address the big questions and relativize it so that it is too broad to be of use we do neither we wished to point out the difference between working scientists and philosophers the debate over positivism is basically a philosophical issue that little affects scientists in the lab or the field scientists occupied by trying to match empirical observations with theoretical expectations often are
 the library quarterly able to create knowledge even though they may have little knowledge or interest in the philosophical issues that underlie their work we are not philosophers and do not pretend to be we are interested in creating a space within lis for scientifically oriented ethnographic researchers to do what they do best that is make theoretically informed empirical observations of social life in addition thomas and nyce claim that we seem to recognize that scientific results are contingent and then go on to contradict ourselves by saying that science is rigorous and objective we do not have the slightest idea what they mean when they say that scientific results are contingent contingent on what we do maintain and clearly point out in our article that scientific results are provisional that is subject to revision when better information or theoretical formulations become available they accuse us of contending that scientific methods are perspective free nowhere do we contend such a thing if our critics mean to imply that the social political and economic context in which scientists operate can influence their research we agree few would disagree with such an obvious statement to paraphrase our article thomas and nyce have constructed a false image of science so that they can then proceed to deconstruct that same image  p  n  following philip d young  we are then accused of being dupes for the ruling class in our defense of scientific ethnography our critics suggest that hidden in our arguments are constructions of power and authority that we perpetuate thus presumably contributing to the exploitation of weak and powerless peoples all over the world this excursion into postmodern double talk would be laughable if it were not taken seriously by people such as thomas and nyce science is a proven and effective means for learning about the natural and social worlds scientific knowledge can be used for or against people it can save lives or kill but in and of itself it neither exploits nor liberates unless one includes liberation from ignorance if thomas and nyce would be willing to discuss the military and political use of scientific knowledge or funding sources and their influence on what research is pursued we could understand and probably would agree with them but to link these political economic factors with the epistemology of science is wrongheaded scientific knowledge is found in all cultures even those not organized along class lines according to our critics we also ignore the constitutive nature of language in shaping and valuing the world we do not ignore this topic it simply has nothing to do with what we wrote about thomas and nyce apparent nominalism should not stand in the way of their grasping the significant features of scientific research regardless of whether reality shapes language or language shapes perceptions of reality scientific ethnography has significantly increased our understanding of the sociocultural systems of the world peoples thanks to scientific ethnography and in spite of its shortcomings and the difficulties of conducting this type of research our knowledge of the human condition is far in advance of what it was even a few years ago thomas and nyce should expand their reading in anthropology beyond the works of the antiscience crowd before they make pronouncements about the field in our article we tried to warn lis researchers that there is more to cultural anthropology than the current evanescent postmodernist fad apparently some readers did not find our advice worth following anthropology four subfields have always been a lightning rod for intellectual currents and it is most unfortunate that lis is discovering ethnographic methods just when several prominent anthropologists have given up hope of gaining systematic knowledge of human social life but while this chorus of naysayers has received a disproportionate share of attention over the past ten years many ethnographers have gone about their work in field sites all over the world producing solid empirical studies in the scientific tradition even
comment  postmodernists recognize that ethnographic research is rooted in the scientific traditions of the late nineteenth century they speak of a so called experimental moment in the s that fuels their hope of turning ethnography away from its scientific origins but it is simply wrong to imply that franz boas was an opponent of scientific anthropology he spent his life trying to improve the scientific standing of anthropology in the face of the grandiose ethnocentric and racist schemes of his contemporaries and immediate predecessors that boas was influenced by the neo kantians including dilthey and his conception of the human sciences does not make boasian anthropology less scientific if historical method was different than physical method it was not therefore outside of or distinct from science  p  and in practice boas conceived of history in rather traditional and indeed somewhat positivistic terms  p  indeed boas was a veritable fortress of scientific sobriety in comparison with most of his contemporaries  p  he was a radical inductivist who insisted on first hand field research for the gathering of empirical information near the end of his life he lost faith that his method would lead to the discovery of universal laws of culture but this did not mean that boas lost faith in science quite the contrary for him science was very much a sacred enterprise  p  and boasian anthropology saw itself and presented itself to the public at large as scientific anthropology  p  thomas and nyce discussion of the nature of ethnography leaves us baffled for them it is not a method per se but it is intended to be a strong form of analysis that answers hard questions that relate to social issues in addition this strong analysis is achieved through iterative questioning and revising of its own practices and categories furthermore they claim to agree with us in this characterization however we do not subscribe to their views on ethnography and we believe that they have seriously misrepresented what we say in our article for us ethnography is an approach to the study of social behavior that is composed of a number of specific methods for example kinship analysis census taking observation componential analysis collection of oral narratives etc cf  p  participant observation is a form of ethnography and most anthropologists use these terms interchangeably no successful research strategy continually revises its practices and categories this is sheer nonsense ethnographers must be flexible and they must find multiple ways to double check their findings but ethnography as a group of specific methods can be taught to students and the best examples can be replicated by other field workers we believe that scientific ethnography has caused a revolution in the study of human behavior and thought for reasons outlined in our article we have no idea what thomas and nyce mean when they say that ethnography can answer the fundamental or hard questions or address critical other problems simply because they do not identify what these are whatever they are we stand accused of robbing ethnography of the ability to answer them as an alternative to the narrow minded scientism they feel that we advocate our critics offer discourse analysis particularly if its units of analysis are broadly defined and are tied analytically say through media to the production and reproduction of experience what can this mean whatever it is the assumption they hold is that information is a discursive construct this vague suggestion is the alternative thomas and nyce offer to replace one hundred years of extremely fruitful even revolutionary progress in understanding the human condition through scientific ethnography nowhere do they address the specific criticisms in our article that we level at antiscientific researchers nor do they address the major issues we discuss no mention is made of the emic etic distinction the qualitative quantitative dichotomy the interplay between induction and deduction or the problem of represent
 the library quarterly ing real humans in analysis their critique is based on a vague and generalized rejection of science as an example of a hidden power structure that falsifies reality in the interests of ruling elites what they do not seem to realize is that their rejection of the search for systematic objective knowledge about social life robs people of their ability to counteract definitions of the world by self serving elites we ask thomas and nyce what in their approach to ethnography makes them think that it can stand up to fascism racism sexism and ethnocentrism as successfully as the proven record of scientific ethnography and its fundamental assumption of the never ending search for objective truth references  sandstrom alan r and pamela effrein sandstrom the use and misuse of anthropological methods in library and infornation science research library quarterly  april     thomas nancy p and nycejames m qualitative research in lis redux a response to a return to positivistic ethnography library quarter  january     fox robin state of the artscience in anthropology in the flight frm science and reason edited by paul r gross norman levitt and martin w lewis pp   annals of the new york academy of sciences vol  june   new york new york academy of sciences  proceedings of a conference held in new york may  june   published separately as a monograph  kuznar lawrence a reclaiming a scintific anthropolo walnut creek calif altamira   young philip d facets of ethnography practice theory fiction reviews in anthroplog      stocking george wjr introduction the basic assumptions of boasian anthropology in a franz boas reader the shaping of american anthropology   edited by george w stocking jr pp   new york basic books   harris marvin historical particularism boas in the rise of anthropological theory a history of theories of culture by marvin harris pp   new york crowell
