alkaline printing papers promise and performance joseph j thomas introduction the printed word remains the backbone of the record of man in all of his activities whether they be in the social industrial political scientific economic or artistic worlds hard copy of the written word still involves paper in spite of the many technological processes of recording that utilize photographic magnetic electronic andor other new techniques invariably we come back to the image on paper as the real workhorse in our daily work of living and doing hence it is pertinent that we today talk about paper as one of mankind primary raw materials that such recording should have permanence seems obvious but only now are we really doing something actively about its longevity paper in the educational field as the vehicle for the transmission of information is but one of its many uses because we have learned to apply paper to all facets of life today we have many different kinds of paper to do many different kinds of jobs world war ii was a major stimulus to our research and development in the paper industry to make paper perform jobs that hitherto had not been dreamed of paper was applied extensively in the war effort in packaging in industrial usages and in many other jobs as other raw materials became scarce or nonexistent today paper has come of age and is the tenth largest industry in the united states this discussion however will be primarily concerned with printing paper and therefore we must define the properties of such paper in terms of its use for printing and publishing certainly we should not apply to printing paper the criteria and specifications that we would apply to industrial papers in other words the end use should truly be reflected in the properties and specifications that we delineate in the case of book manufacture such paper is to receive accurately the image from the printing plate it must handle well through the presses and the bindery and finally it must perform in the hands of the reader thus manifold uses should be covered in the so called specifications economically it would be wasteful to build more into the paper than is needed for its optimum performance on the other hand adequate properties to embrace optimum manufacturing and usage must be covered paper composition its method of manufacture conversion to use storage and utilization should all be weighed in consideration of specifications for example newsprint with its temporary transient use certainly differs in requirements from the permanent archival uses of the historian likewise the properties required in papers for machine shop manuals army maps or navy charts differ from those needed for insurance rate books or chemical handbooks whose usage will be rendered obsolete with time as technological progress out dates the information contained therein papers for electrophotographic printing or for magnetic recording must have a different definition from paper to be printed by gravure and used as a label on a bottle or tin can 
 the library quarterly therefore my remarks on paper will be confined to the end uses of printing publishing binding and finally as a book in your hands in the library where it should remain available and usable to posterity  or  years from now historical examination of the literature shows that there has been a great deal of interest in the permanizing of man records by studying the substrate paper there seems to have been much talk but little action until w j barrow really lit a fire on the subject in the s and s two papers with comprehensive bibliographies on paper durability are us government printing office technical bulletin no  published in  and entitled permanence and durability of paper an annotated bibliography from  ad to  ad and paper performance by philip luner in tappi magazine  no  may   for those who wish a comprehensive study on the subject i would recommend these two references for good historical and technical background back in the good old days when life moved a little more leisurely and there were fewer economic and competitive pressures rag papers made in a slow careful way seemed to be the answer to the longevity problem but this was not wholly true especially if sizing was obtained by the use of alum with rosin however as economic pressures demanded more and more production at lower costs the change to wood fibers met the ever increasing demand for paper mass production became the paper way of life and we lost something alum became the papermaker panacea for it not only set rosin to give sizing a temporary resistance to water but it also made the wet fibrous slurry on the fourdrinier wire more free to drain water and thus increased production despite these advantages however the use of alum resulted in acid paper origin of alkaline papers i would like to be able to say that we in our company had the perspicacity to see the evil of alum and to predict our alkaline future but as in many discoveries the real stimulation was pressure to utilize a by product that came from our soda process in isolating fibers from trees lime mud resulted from our recovery of soda cooking liquors when we treated the ash from the burning of our pulp cooking liquor with slaked lime fig  this regenerated our soda chemicals to be used in cooking more wood but the resulting useless precipitate was calcium carbonate which we could only pile up behind the mill its nice white color made it look tempting and we hoped to find a use for this by product since the bleached purified cellulosic fibers coming from that pulp mill made such excellent book paper we had already established to our own satisfaction that cellulose fibers regardless of their source whether it be rags or trees if purified were of a durable and permanent character and that we could make good and lasting paper from properly purified wood fibers credit for much of this thinking goes to the father of paper chemistry edwin sutermeister who had come to us as a new graduate from the massachusetts institute of technology in  it was he who in  made the experiments with lime mud and set aside a series of papers that he examined periodically to see the effect of this by product on the paper versus the usual paper making techniques extant specifically he

 the library quarterly the factors which mnust be taken into consideration are light heat air moisture dust gases etc it is very important that we understand the difference between durability and permanence because the latter is the retention of significant use properties while the other is retention of original quality under continual use for example a business machine tabulation card under continual use certainly must be durable and resist handling abuse a book on the library shelf is consulted only occasionally and is handled far more gently while it does not have to have the same initial strength it should retain its ability to be consulted and endure over a prolonged period of time if you recall my original statements about fitting the manufacture of paper to the end use you will begin to appreciate that book papers can be produced from pure fibers and nondeteriorating chemicals which enable it to be uniformly printed collated and bound into a permanent book the strength needed is that required to go efficiently through the various processes of the print shop and the bindery and then to be capable of final usage reading andor consulting of it it would be economically unsound to use expensive strong pulps simply to get durability in addition such fibers do not print well have no mellowness or aesthetic appeal the papermaker balances his so called furnish to meet the end use best and in the case of book papers there need be no compromise on permanence the recipe used should be pure pulps with other chemicals added only to the extent that they enable the printing paper to perform its job if sizing is required it should be done from an alkaline medium by sizing we mean sufficient resistance to water to be lithographically printed andor written upon with water inks if this is indicated for many years this question of sizing was the excuse for using rosin and alum but in the s hercules powder company came out with an alkaline sizing material known as aquapel there are now other competitive products on the market warren was one of the first to take advantage of this new alkaline sizing material and we developed proprietary methods for incorporating it into our paper along with the filler calcium carbonate which gave permanence through its buffering ability to keep the paper neutral or slightly alkaline we have made thousands of tons of book papers by these techniques over the past twelve to fifteen years this paper has been sucessfully processed through our customer plants and onto library shelves furthermore our proprietary techniques for alkaline sizing and filling are through licensing being used in many overseas paper mills calcium carbonate is an inert white bright pigment it simply is dormant in the paper and available if any acid is encountered such as in uncontrolled storage conditions in other words calcium carbonate is a slightly alkaline inert buffer which stands guard against acidic conditions we believe that all book papers should contain a residual of some calcium carbonate regardless of what other fillers may be present be they clay or tio the permanence of calcium carbonate itself is attested to by the fact that marble is the purest natural form of calcium carbonate and as you well know marble has been used for centuries in the artistic sculptural world for statuary other means of obtaining neutral or alkaline conditions can be utilized in tie manufacture of paper even if they
alkaline printing papers  are less ideal than the use of our inert filler calcium carbonate for example many good and permanent papers are made by combinations of basic bodystock paper plus surface size andor plus coatings we have seen in our own work where alkaline coatings such as those containing satin white placed upon a slightly acidic bodystock gave a composite ph on the neutral or alkaline side for example we made such a composite coated sheet in  and have followed its natural aging characteristics over the years as shown in figure  its extracted ph is  note that we have tried to draw a smooth curve through the average values for mullen burst mit  kg folding endurance and elmendorf tear strength cross and with grain data combined the test numbers show some variance probably due to operator instrument andor sampling techniques over such a forty year span but it is clear that this coated paper has leveled off in its strength properties with time it still is in good condition and usable parenthetically it should be mentioned that the heavy weight of this type of coating which was usually applied at that time put a burden on fold but it still was sufficient for making into a book admittedly these sandwiches or composites are not ideal but they are certainly better than a totally acidic paper the question is just how far down these superimposed layers penetrate to neutralize any acidity in the base and when they do what the effects of the residual neutralized salts are obviously a uniform alkaline or neutral paper throughout its cross section is better than a sandwich of different layers but if the composite is neutral or alkaline the odds are good that permanence also will be good testing methods methods of testing have been controversial in this permanence field for years and the battle still rages sutermeister work does show however that the alkaline theory has stood the test of time of natural aging witness the  samples already cited but we cannot wait for fifty or  years to do the testing so we must rely upon accelerated aging tests such as tappi p which is a seventy two hour aging at  c then measuring folding endurance results are expressed as the percentage of the fold retained after the exposure barrow recommends a similar test but does resistance to simple dry heat indicate permanence or just resistance to heat degradation for this reason gray of eastman kodak in a paper published in tappi february  feels that moisture should be added to the test likewise luner in the reference cited earlier recommends a test in which the exposure would be from  c but in an atmosphere of   percent moisture which he feels would better correspond to the chemical reactions occurring at room temperature with time he recommends the folding test as the best criterion after such exposure qualitative spot testing that the barrow laboratory recommends currently does give quick indications of potential permanence by the measure of ph groundwood content and the presence of alum and rosin of all these tests ph determination is the most significant one we concur in barrow recommendation of  or above as a good criterion of longevity the initial physical strength tests however we feel do not necessarily have to be fixed but should be correlated with the end use of the paper the ultimate accelerated test for longevity will be one that not only

alkaline printing papers  takes into account the initial recipe but also the conditions that the paper will encounter in its processing usage and storage converting and storage there are many chemical influences to which a book paper is subjected in its life history printing processes in themselves may add chemicals such as residues from the fountain solutions andor inks generally speaking the tests from our print shop research indicate that these influences are minorthat if calcium carbonate is used it generally will cope with any acidic additive we have definitely shown a correlation between alkaline ph and good ink drying especially in the normal relative humidity ranges of the print shop of   percent also the binding chemicals the adhesives used there can have an effect especially if these are acidic but here again our panacea calcium carbonate may well handle this too atmospheric exposure such as to the burning of fossil fuels which may give rise to sulfur dioxide so and carbon dioxide co must be taken into account air conditioning and air filtering should help here again residual calcium carbonate will act as a buffer certainly we should avoid light and extremes of temperature and humidity as well as guarding against the attacks of insects and vermin forecasting the future what about the future as long as purified cellulosic wood fibers can be obtained economically and under good conservation practices they will probably form the lowest cost substrate for the printed medium whether the basic paper itself be filled surface sized coated or converted in some other way this presumes that materials added to paper do not cause chemical deterioration the best insurance against this of course is the neutral buffer calcium carbonate our crystal ball does have a picture of plastics some day filling some role although their permanence too will have to be established by adequate test techniques some plastic papers for printing are being made today especially in japan but they are currently so expensive that we need not consider them for general printing uses just when the petrochemical or plastic industry can produce a product as low in cost and effective in use as nature cellulose remains to be weighed as technological progress is made with time certainly for the present and foreseeable future the work done by sutermeister and well substantiated and proclaimed by barrow still holds the best insurance for permanence of the printed word is on paper made on the neutral or preferably alkaline side present technology is such that book papers can be so made whether they be sized or not whether they be coated or not the costs may be slightly higher today but as more and more mills shift to alkaline paper manufacturing this disadvantage should disappear librarians can have confidence in this approach to making paper and their future worries about permanence will be minimized
discussion greer allen joseph j thomas has recounted the way in which the s d warren paper company shifted its book paper production to papers of higher alkalinitythus insuring according to current research papers of greater permanence this is a remarkable history of yankee opportunism and good luck the company managed to arrange its methods some years back to solve problems that were to reach critical magnitude half a century later this was mr thomas assignment to discuss the making of permanent book papers his technical presentation of the subject is impressive as befits his eminent qualifications i am in no position to criticize it because i am a printer rather than a paper chemist my assignment is to comment on the printer reaction to the emphasis on permanence and durability in papers as compared to other qualities that are necessary to produce good printing elsewhere in these papers leonard shatzkin discusses these qualities from the standpoint of a publisher i shall take you into the shop where such standard but diversified items as paper ink type presses folding machines binding thread and glue have to be arranged and managed in order to produce a good book it is important for the printer to have a voice in the great permanence and durability debate usually whenever people assemble to discuss processes and solutions to the problems of bringing modern commercial publishing papers to a state of longevity that they have not heretofore enjoyed the exchange of views is restricted to three principal parties the papermaker the publisher and the librarian surely i would not want to omit one of these each spends a great deal of time performing some critical service connected with the life of the paper in question but it is only natural that when they get together each seeks to grind a particular axe it is only fair since the printer is equally involved for him to have a turn at the grindstone the papermaker recounts how he has been introducing chemicals and manufacturing systems which precipitate and neutralize impurities conjuring up as he goes along visions akin to those soapsuds commercials on television where we are treated to a view of smiling eager little enzymes gobbling up a veritable panoply of offending ingredients then there is the publisher oppressed on the one hand by the stringent demands of purchasing committees to make his books withstand abuses from an ever more licensed and uncontained body of young people chided on the other by the librarian who seems never so smug and delighted as when he is pointing to browned edges and frayed bindings and finally he is constrained by an awareness of his own reputation that marketable yet elusive asset the view taken of him by his buying public his agents the bookstores and quite vital his authors the third man in the discussion is the custodian of books the librarian himself he is never quite sure whether he 
alkaline printing papers  is serving learning by making his volumes convenient to the readers or running a sort of geriatric nursing home for decrepit books and all the while he thrashes about trying to find a culprit on whom to pin the ills of his deteriorating charges the view of the commercial printerand binder in relation to paper permanence is rarely called for hardly ever articulated it is generally misunderstood and more often than anything it is inaccurately presumed consequently i am writing not as a service oriented printer in a great research and teaching institution where responsibility beyond one immediate purview is part of the job but i aim to set forth the views of the average commercial printer touching permanence in paper i imagine that there is a general eagerness to hear what he thinks about because it is for him and not for me that mr thomas and his brothers in industry churn their fourdrinier machines so endlessly and it is to him and not to me that mr shatzkin and his publishing colleagues turn to have their many new titles and reprints fabricated each year and finally mr soderland must admit that his library shelves are filled to the brim not with a harvest from my presses but from his the concern of the average commercial printer for paper permanence is remarkable is the reader ready to discover it i seriously wonder if he can take it the truth is that the average commercial printer could not care less he does not give a damn if i may quote one informant in my recent survey despite responsible sounding sales talks and other public utterances which he feels obliged to make just catch such a printer over a martini after a day filled with machine costs tax adjustments wage settlements and work spoilage then he will own that permanence in paper is just not very high on his list of pressing distractions i stress his position because it is important to know it as we comb over the finer points of technology we had better remember this small but critical slice of reality and drop in a pinch now and then to leaven our debates when i claimed earlier that the commercial printer position is inaccurately presumed i meant that too often we realize in a benumbed sort of way that the printer is not very bothered about paper permanence yet underlying all this is a stifled sense of outrage because god knows he most certainly ought to be  therein lies the problem the printer operates in a highly competitive market with a rather mean profit margin unless the world can make it worth his while in dollars and cents to exercise a preference for permanent papers or at least to feel equivocal about printing on them then we will get nowhere in overcoming his indifference this is not surprising others involved in the debate have economic interests too concern for permanence has of course been profitable yea vitall for librarians who would be a custodian for long if he were expected to spend his time among shelves of crumbled pulverized fragments which had once been books the published as another party feels the dollar pinch when for example he loses a large state adoption because his sample book did not hold up as it careened through that ingenious bibliographic amusement park the text book testing laboratory and mr thomas can recount if not measure precisely the tangible benefits reaped by at least one papermaker who early grew concerned about self destruction in paper took manufacturing steps to
 the library quarterly end it and was not at all bashful about letting his customers the publishers know just what he had done but commercial printers except for a handful of highly specialized book manufacturers and binders are at best unconcerned and more typically quite ignorant of these matters printers familiar with permanence view it as a quality on which a few particular clients insist and one which often compounds the already complex problem of getting the ink down on the paper as quickly as possible all the while meeting prearranged quality standards to get the printer who is involved in paper selection interested in permanence we will have to show him on the one hand that specifying permanent papers is an important service to his clients and on the other that it will cost him no more than it is worth in dollars and cents either in cash or in terms of production time in doing this the paper manufacturer will have to see to it that paper made to last carries the same built in defenses against the common printing and binding ills that all well constructed printing papers now carry let me share with you some of my experiences with permanized papers and describe a few of the critical qualities which concern the printer for example a few years ago at a time when we were becoming eager to avoid self destructive papers and were proceeding with some degree of success in selecting publishing sheets with a preference for less acidity we encountered a client who insisted that his job be run on a paper with the highest ph factor we could find the job in question was an offset book with small halftones it carried photos of equipment in subtle gradations to distinguish essential details we tested a number of sheets and found a shockingly positive correlation between acidity and clear reproduction the more alkaline sheets available at the time just would not hold the best images when faced with the decision between publishing on a more permanent sheet and obtaining the best photoreproduction i told him we would not stand behind the reproduction on just any old sheet this very responsible client knuckled under and selected the acid content sheet the job was completed and i have not heard if the books are still intact two factors concerned us as printers in this particular case brightness and ink holdout brighter whiter papers permit halftone dot photoreproductions to show the maximum contrast between black and white and consequent definition of detail ink holdout is the ability of the paper to trap the ink chemicals on the paper surface to dry right there and in doing so to permit the ink to show off its varnished shine and its blackness thus it does not sink deep into the paper leaving the image lifeless and washed out here very poignantly is the conflict between responsibility and reputation if we had run the job on the alkaline sheet all the world would have seen what miserable printers we are take another case it may indicate why printers shy from involvement in what appear to be experiments it illustrates what i meant earlier when i said that permanence and durability must be built into papers without altering the printing and handling characteristics which the printer has grown to expect if he is to become anything but livid when confronted with the sheets this is the tale of a client who did not knuckle under and of a university printer who unwittingly walked smack into a technological mine field
alkaline printing papers  when we contemplate printing on acetate or vegetable parchment or some vinyl coated substance we of course make tests and careful inquiries to select the proper inks drying agents and sprays to be sure the sheets will dry promptly without offsetting that is allowing the wet image to print on the underside of the sheet above it in the delivery pile but when we prepare to print on a so called text or antique finish book paper we and other job printers like us have found from general experience that the behavior of all these sheets falls within normal parameters or in other words the pressman knows what to expect when he puts the job on the press he might have to dope up his ink add driers extenders thinners adjust the lithographic water ink balance or repack his impression cylinder to obtain the most suitable pressure but he usually feels he is working within limits that he knows however on the particular job i am about to describe the client called for a specific brand name of paper the sheet was one constructed primarily as a permanent and durable paper which indeed it was and is  but its printing qualities as printers have come to know them appear to have been secondary considerations in its manufacture for one thing it was rather more transparent than sheets of similar substance its opacity was low to overcome this we increased the weight of the paper selected from seventy pounds per standard ream to eighty knowing full well that it might double the sheetwork the folding and sewing but it seemed worth the effort and the cost when we put it on the offset press and applied the usual amount of ink we found that it did not behave in the expected way our pressman experimented with it after much delay he found that we could run the sheets without offsetting but with the result that the image was weaker than we would have wished it to be on later investigation we found that an obscure additive would have inhibited the offsetting adequately we folded the sheets without mishap and sewed them successfully the job was to be a paperback with gluedon covers we put it on our covering machine only to find that the paper repelled our natural adhesives we lifted the job and rushed it to another binder whose polyvinyl actetate emulsion succeeded admirably in gluing the covers to the books and meeting the deadline this account will show the sorts of traps a printer may stumble into unless such papers come to him with better information and warnings the second time around of course it was easy admittedly this was a rather abrupt introduction to printing on permanent papers ideal from the standpoint of paper endurance but it tried the endurance of the printer who was as ill prepared as most commercial printers tend to be under similar conditions because most of the permanized publication papers to which the printer must be introduced possess printing and binding properties indistinguishable from their acidic siblings now we have covered brightness opacity receptivity to adhesives inkholdout and drying qualities what are some of the other paper characteristics which mean so much to us printers several fall under the heading of runability how will the sheet run or feed through systems in which the sheet is passed from the skid at the feed end of the press by an elaborate system of vacuum cups little metal gripping fin
