pv using focus groups to gather information for lis curriculum review charles curraa stephen bajjaly patricia feehan and ann l oeill this article presents a general description of focus group activity designed to generate information for use in making decisions about core and elective courses in a library and information science lis curriculum while the results reported may be specific to the environment studied the process can be useful in a variety of settings faculty who wish to teach well may benefit from knowing what their constituents expect from new graduates of lis programs moreover successfully managed focus groups enable employers to experience involvement with lis program review this can produce valuable good will introduction what should readers expect from an article on the use of focus groups convened to give employers a chance to discuss curriculum with lis educators they should expect to learn how focus group activities fit into a program review process what questions were asked how the groups were selected and managed what the respondents said and how their responses were analyzed and fed into the faculty decision apparatus how focus group activity fits with us program review the issues of what to teach and how to teach well are closely related although most of this journal issue is devoted to teaching well this report focuses upon one way to discover what to teach well many factors  healthy curiosity faculty interest and commitment an involved dean a visiting regional accrediting agency or even a curious ala committee on accreditation  may encourage an lis faculty to engage in systematic review of program and curriculum this systematic review might include reviewing courses inspecting the variety of available competencies lists gathering information from the market place and listening to the professionals who hire and supervise lis graduates providers have unique and interesting perspectives they manage in the trenches and deal daily with serious problems they try to meet the demands of the present and plan for the unknown challenges of the future and they have much to tell lis educators about what they expect new hires to be able to accomplish a systematic review might also involve an lis faculty in looking at curriculum  core and elective  and at the sequence in which the courses are delivered summer  
  journal of education for library and information science about the authors charles curran is professor stephen bajjaly patricia feehan and ann l oeill are assistant professors college of library and information science university of south carolina usc at the university of south carolina the faculty of the college of library and information science undertook a curriculum review and decided to look first at the six core courses and then use focus groups to obtain information to help them further explore curriculum issues uncovered during the inspection of the core the next step was to apply what was learned in the core review and the focus groups to an analysis of elective courses the core review the curriculum committee cc undertook the job of managing the review of the core courses the core consists of six required courses in professional issues and opportunities bibliographic organization and control reference services management research methods and technological applications at a special faculty meeting devoted to core review each instructor who teaches a core course made a half hour presentation these instructors had met in groups of two or three to prepare a report containing  an overview of course content  a description of course assignments  how if at all one faculty member version of the course differed from a colleague  how one version complies with the faculty previously  established and agreed upon general goals and objectives for each core course while each faculty member regularly teaches at least one core course most teach two the review exercise reacquainted the veteran faculty with the entire core and helped new faculty see the larger picture and specifically how each course contributes to the faculty notion of coreness or of what it is they believe to be basic to an understanding of the information professions the faculty then turned to its external constituency  employers of lis program graduates  for assistance in reviewing both core and elective courses the review session also provided an opportunity to question content and delivery and to challenge either there were many questions but few overt challenges probably because the faculty had heard and dealt with challenges during the previous review in  the cc believed that the biggest challenge to the core content would be delivered by the focus groups why focus groups lis faculties try to craft elastic and responsive curricula which produce graduates who hit the ground running and provide their employers with the enlightened up to date approaches so necessary in the challenging work places of today creating such a curriculum is an on going process not a onestep procedure the process has to be hospitable to change to weeding as well as to seeding and it has to consider volume  number

  journal of education for library and information science  acknowledge that there are other ways to learn focus groups are but one while all the faculty participated in the training only the authors of this paper conducted the focus groups having taken the training and having established an investment in the process the full faculty was educated about the process they were won over receptive and prepared to be informed consumers of the information gathered from the groups a serendipitous plus developed also the cc because of faculty schedule limitations had to enlist the aid of students as recorders this turned out to be a great opportunity for seven lucky students to meet prospective employers and listen to their concerns the whole process contributed to their learning about the information professions and happily it reinforced substantial chunks of what they were hearing from their professors in one focus group session knowing the recorder was a student and wanting her opinion group members insisted on hearing what she thought about the issue under discussion the conversation which followed was eye opening for the group and exciting for the student what questions decide what you want to know the cc and the faculty wanted to know what people who manage information agencies within a three state area think lis faculty ought to be teaching and emphasizing the faculty wanted to hear from several kinds of agencies and from middle and upper management they wanted to learn whether some decisions they had made and were contemplating fit with the respondents descriptions of the information market place decide what questions to ask the cc and the full faculty agreed to make a list of questions for use with focus groups the basic guideline was what do we need to learn from our constituents that could affect what we teach and how we teach the following questionsrequests were selected after considerable back and forth discussion  in your organization what major concerns and issues are you facing today  what trends and likely future developments should we keep in mind as we plan our lis curriculum  what is your laundry list of basic managerial skills  insofar as your organization is concerned what do you expect a new hire to bring from hisher lis education  how much on the job training ojt do you expect to provide  what are the key skills and attitudes you believe beginning information professionals should possess  what gaps in lis education have you noticed  in your job or organization what has caught you by surprise the cc anticipated that some questions might draw similar kinds of responses and prepared to manage and record in a way that would provide both the opportunity to elicit needed responses and a way to avoid duplication decide whom to select and how to manage the focus groups selecting for purposes of examining the curriculum the cc had already convinced the faculty to work in teams there was an administrationmanagement team a materials team a school library media team a technology team a technical volume  number

 journal of education for library and information science you are gathering opinions not doing science what can result from an efficiently conducted focus group is a useful assortment of opinions which decision makers may factor into their deliberations about lis curricula it is a mistake to generalize from these few responses to an entire population without testing more widely for corroborati on or to confuse focus groups with survey techniques what the respondents said in response to question one about major concerns and issues and in order of frequency of mention here is what the respondents reported  adopting and welcoming new technology  dealing with change  finding alternative sources of incomebudgeting  marketing and public relations  practicing effective interpersonal skills  meeting expectations of clients  obtaining access to information resources  training importance of internships emphasized  dealing with political concerns affecting the organization readers should note the predominance of technological and interpersonal communication issues the dual focus is very clear in response to question two the groups reported several trends note again the emphasis upon communication skills  increasing need for people skills  greater responsibility for managers to both find and act as mentors to direct and evaluate computer operations and to set and meet customer satisfaction goals  expanding role of information professionals as teachers in school environments they will be teachers of teachers the groups named several basic managerial skills in response to question three  personal skills and attributes like ambition patience and flexibility they hold the lis school responsible for instilling these  communication skills  directing  budgeting not the figuring but the convincing and winning  planning question four asked respondents to tell what they wanted new hires to bring to their organizations the majority of responses fell into three categories technical skills personal attributes and interpretive skills over and over again respondents repeated that they look to new graduates whom they believe and expect to be armed with all the latest know how to apply and teach the latest technology in the organization with respect to personal attributes most often the respondents named maturity self confidence and the willingness to take risks moreover they want new hires with enthusiasm vision people friendliness flexibility and the ability to respond when pressured the interpretive skills most often mentioned were the ability to make presentations instruct clients understand priorities deal with the corporate culture and make people feel good how much ojt do employers expect to provide question five drew a wide range of responses some responded none others said lots some systems employers expect their volume  number

  journal of education for library and information science used by the faculty to inspect the core accomplished two useful purposes first the communication about content was solid and direct second the responses were re affirming the faculty appears to be doing the right thing in that they have infused the core with heavy doses of technology and communication the major areas of interest reported by the fifty respondents the faculty will increase the effort to incorporate these skills even more  in both core and elective offerings the attitudes issue uncovered by responses to question six will continue to be a difficult one to address leading by example may be the best tactic according to the superior lis teachers whose responses to the question what do you do that causes people to identify you as a superior teacher appear elsewhere in this issue after reviewing the focus group comments the usc clis faculty has decided to recommission the study teams materials technology technical services etc this time to examine elective offerings provided by the team members now they have the benefit of the opinions collected from their employer client group to add to their own storehouses of observations opinions and attitudes the cc will probably employ focus groups again and has already begun to teach focus group techniques to students in administration courses there are sound political reasons for doing focus groups too focus group methodology can democratize the conversation process by providing participants built in provisions for gate keeping which let everybody not just the big shots talk directly to lis program hosts again focus groups let people speak up about issues which affect them and for which there is a very interested and receptive audience  an lis faculty things change needs develop opinions vary so an lis faculty must continue to monitor conditions the focus group snapshot is one very useful aid in the process references  mary wagner and suzanne mahmoodi a focus group interview manual chicago ala  volume  number
