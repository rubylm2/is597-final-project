lnegotiating borders librarianship and twenty first century politics nadia caidi j j ghaddar and danielle allard abstract recent developments in canada the united states and beyond continue to test librarians resolve and to redefine how we view ourselves and engage with communities drawing on examples from both canada and the united states and deploying the concept of border as an analytical trope we seek to probe and unsettle the geographic professional and ideological interfaces that librarians constantly negotiate in a world where data know no borders but indigenous and other bodies are constrained by them how do we respond to the calls to action of canadas truth and reconciliation commission to the violent displacement of millions of syrians to the resurgence of divisive politics and racist rhetorics or to the surrender to data using the trump election as a launching point we explore key drivers for change in lis in instances when politics spill into our professional purview ibraries and the professionals that work within them are invariably shaped by the social contexts in which they are embedded for the library and information science lis field the recent election of president donald j trump has served as a stark reminder of how the boundaries of the professional and the political are far from stable and of the continued relevance of racism in the world the coming to power of an administration that flirts carelessly with facts and data and that espouses a divisive and at times vitriolic discourse meant to inflame rather than unite people tests librarians resolve today in much the same way that mccarthyism did during the coldwar preer  robbins     jenkins   or that the patriot act did after  ala  estabrook a b jordan  oder a b starr  see also caidi and ross  lyon  caidi and macdonald  roach  for relevant discussion in a canadian context as with these instances the new administrations policies force librarians to confront ethical and practical dilemmas about the role of information institutions and professionals in facilitating chauvinistic and exclusionary policies that harm and discriminate against individuals and communities we are mandated to serve that infringe on the right to privacy and freedom of inquiry and that suppress the free and open exchange of knowledge and information on an ideological basislibrary quarterly information community policy vol  no  pp    by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
  the library quarterlywhen politics inordinately spills over into their professional purview librarians tend to grip firmly to their core set of professional ethics and values in an attempt to assert their role in society and their engagement with the communities they serve moments such as the recent election of trump thus serve to reify even as they challenge librarians and information professionals ethical and professional stances indeed the repercussions of the trump presidential victory were quickly felt within the lis field in north americaturtle island in an attempt to navigate alternative facts and fake news some librarians and lis educators took it upon themselves to develop information and media literacy opportunities for their publics ala public programs office  faced with the threat of removal of public data guerilla archiving initiatives took place with librarians in their midst alongside more concerted efforts by the likes of the internet archive which partnered with american and canadian research libraries and educational institutions to house critical data eg on the environment and climate change on servers in the united states and abroad as a means of protecting data from web scrubbing based on ideology a controversial statement of support for the new administration issued by the washington office of the american library association ala provoked important debate within our professional associations and spaces about our core values and responsibilities and how they aligned with the new administrations positions as a consequence ala a b rescinded its original statement and qualified its position along with several other organizations including the association for library and information science education and the association for information science and technology ala released position statements opposing the new administrations measures including executive order  which halted all refugee admissions and effectively banned citizens of iran iraq libya somalia sudan syria and yemen from entry into the united states this engagement from lis professionals qualifies our professions position on neutrality and allows us to be vocal on causes that we deem critical in the current context librarians and information professionals as noted have taken a strong position on such issues as the critical importance of access to public knowledge and information literacy intellectual freedom and the preservation of state produced documents and information in contrast the lis profession has been relatively silent on other presidential executive orders such as those that green light the construction of the controversial energy transfer partners dakota access pipeline that infringes on and poses a threat to the treaty lands of the standing rock sioux tribe of the ochethi sakowi≈ã the great sioux nation reactions to the election of trump and recent decisions by the new administration signal that librarianship operates in an interconnected world where what happens there has im  since the passing of this executive order a number of court challenges were launched challenging its constitutionality after a federal court effectively blocked the order the administration issued on march  a new order replacing the earlier one with slight modifications eg iraq was removed from the list of banned countries court cases were also mounted against the revised text and appeals continue to be heard on the courts decision to uphold the block as this article goes to print
negotiating borders  plications for here in a show of support the canadian federation of library associations federation canadienne des associations de bibliotheques cflafcab a endorsed the american library association ala statement issued january   defending library core values and condemning recent events in the united states the rationale that both ala and the cflafcab give for their position is that librarians champion values that include access to information privacy democracy equity diversity and inclusion intellectual freedom and social responsibility cflafcab a goes on to say that canadian libraries stand together in unity with our american library colleagues in support of welcoming and inclusive communities such statements are laudable but this article interrogates what it is that libraries mean when they speak about inclusion and diversity and how we might broaden and rethink these concepts in line with the current political moment as individuals and as professionals members of the lis fields broadly construed serve their communities provide access to information and generally abide by the core ethics and values of our professions as such these professionals are already implicated in the wider social and political environments in which they are embedded whether they realize it or not whether they choose it or not moreover as jonathan cope  notes every facet of the libraryand by extension every decision and act of a librarianhas ideological and political import the vision of the ideologically neutral library should be consigned to the proverbial dustbin of history  earlier we noted several examples of librarians responding unneutrally and directly to the current political moment yet we would like to argue in this article that lis professionals are not always aware of the full extent to which they are implicated and of the responsibility they bear at times this is because of our tendency to focus too narrowly on the local or national context or the specificities of the communities we work with and to consider too little the broader historical and structural factors at play we need to be attuned to for example how geopolitical interests and global processes manifest themselves at local national and transnational levels in part this would entail moving beyond strictly national framings of our work and institutions while recognizing that libraries particularly public ones are deeply embedded within national projects histories and structures more specifically because the trump administrations inflammatory racist and exclusionary rhetoric and actions raise such important questions for both us and canadian societies about the nature of diversity and inclusion within our national contexts we ask what do librarians miss when they approach diversity and inclusion from a narrow perspective that does not consider the intersecting histories and systems that oppress and marginalize those that are imagined as other moreover as we consider the nature and scope of engagement by lis professionals within the current political landscape we must be aware of the broader political context of an allegedly postracial milieu replete with rhetorics about the triumph of neoliberalism and a liberal antiracism that supports white privilege and masks racial tensions and inequalities as critical race theorist kimberle crenshaw  points out claims that we
  the library quarterlylive in a postracial milieu posit a racially egalitarian united states and therefore foreclose the possibility of addressing the persistence of racial injustice and the continued centrality of race in structuring the world crenshaw explains as post racialism becomes the vehicle for a colorblind agenda the material consequences of racial exploitation and social violenceincluding the persistence of educational inequity the disproportionate racial patterns of criminalization and incarceration and the deepening patterns of economic stratificationslide further into obscurity under the thrall of post racialism these stubborn conditions pose little challenge to interpreting the historical election of one politician obama as the end of racism  declaring race to be irrelevant in fact sanctions and enables the persistence of the conditions that make racial oppression possible yet the resurgence of racial and divisive rhetorics with the trump phenomenon and parallel political movements in europe and elsewhere have made it increasingly untenable to posit a postracial turn despite what the politics of accommodation and rollback would have us believe paradoxically postracialism as an ideology had a hand in the trump election postracialism pragmatically reduces racial injustice or inequity to racial difference and does not consider asymmetries in racial power this move makes it possible for anxiety about white victimization which trump tapped into during his election campaign to emerge in a country like the united states where power whether economic political or social continues to be predominantly centered within the white population although distributed unequally within it our discussion speaks to and seeks to elaborate on scholarship that is critical of the dominant diversity paradigm within our field most recently in his literature review of diversity in lis david james hudson  noted that diversity is a trope of a liberal multiculturalism that treats racism as an individual problem or pathology rather than a structural phenomenon this article seeks to respond to his call for an understanding of the historically contingent and socially constructed nature of racial categories and for research that moves beyond the prevalent diversity framework by attending to the specificities of racialized and racializing knowledge production in different lis contexts as well as their intersection with the macroand microdynamics of white supremacist power relations  hudsons insightful work points to how the lis field is itself a site in and through which racialized difference is produced and that therefore racial dynamics in lis are an extension of broader systems of racial domination we elaborate on hudsons work by attending to the histories and cross border dynamics informing the lisrace nexus within our political moment the racial conundrums and the paradoxes of the trump presidency are not easily contained within or explained through the nation state borders of the united states the contradictory forces at play in trumps election are felt everywhere albeit differently as the canadian state embarks on celebrations of the th anniversary of its establishment it is confronted with its own challenges around the meaning of confederation and canadian identity and the role that settler colonialism and racial domination have played in the countrys history the multifaceted and creative resistance taking place across the country to the official

negotiating borders  land and people from an indigenous perspective hill  explains the border crossed us the nation state borders of north america are considered tenuous at best from an indigenous perspective not only are these borders antithetical to indigenous relations to land and geographic understandings but they also do not register indigenous experiences of the regional and global nature and scope of settler colonialism it is not a coincidence that in both canada and the united states indigenous children were forced into educational institutions that aimed not to educate but rather to eradicate indigenous cultures and languages and to sever indigenous childrens relations to their families people and land even a cursory examination of the literature on residential or boarding schools on either side of the border would illustrate this point the trc final report  is an excellent starting point to delve into this topic and access other relevant literature established in june  the trc was mandated to foster a process of national reconciliation and truth telling about the irs system as part of its work the trc unearthed and circulated many stories that encourage us to consider how settler colonialism in canada despite all its particularities needs to be understood as part of the shifting regional and global processes that made possible and today reinforce canadas borders the tremendous work done by the trc which included the gathering of thousands of survivor testimonies and the collection and processing of thousands of stateand church produced archival records resulted in an account that details how more than  indigenous children were forcibly taken from their families communities and nations the trcs work also demonstrates the violence and racism that made the irs possible among other things the trcs  final report unsettles the national narrative of canada and forces canadian society to acknowledge and confront its colonial past and present and as alluded to earlier the trcs work also unsettles the fixity of our national borders it speaks to the experiences and realities of indigenous people and nations whose lands and histories cannot be easily accommodated within the dominant spatial logics of north america as such the trc is not just a canadian issue the trcs final report also compels libraries and other information institutions to reflect on the fact that they are themselves colonial institutions indeed in its final report the trc calls for extensive changes in the fields of education health language and law and in relation to lams the pertinent calls to action and related discussion on lams in the final report indicate how these institutions are part of perpetuating a canadian national memory and historical consciousness that erases indigenous experiences and histories as part of claiming the land as national territory at an even more basic level the fact that lams operate only in the languages of the settler society and not in indigenous languages is indicative of their colonial origins and present although beyond the scope of the discussion here it is important to note that scholarship in the information fields is increasingly concerned with and tending to these and related issues at both practical and theoretical levels eg moorcroft  hills  szekely  wareham  carter  nakata and langton  doyle

negotiating borders  ious immigration classification schemes are used to determine eligibility to specific resources or programs and to permanent residency or citizenship status the stated rationale for such schemes is the adequate allocation of resources but the fact that these eligibility criteria are defined inconsistently over time create a confusing environment for many service providers including public libraries and for frontline professionals berinstein et al  goldring berinstein and bernhard  they also obfuscate the fact that those seeking refuge from persecution may not meet the bureaucratic or judicial criteria to qualify as refugees and they therefore arrive under other immigration categories eg family immigrants foreign workers in other words these categories serve bureaucratic and legal ends in a manner that harms and excludes people and therefore librarians must avoid an uncritical acceptance of or conformity with the logic and practical implications of them in her examination of the temporary foreign worker program sarah elizabeth roberts  notes that beyond the rational arguments that are used to justify such approaches there are also values and assumptions that underpin these policies to highlight the relative and contingent nature of immigration classification systems specifically roberts suggests that decisions are neither objective nor purely rational rather decisions are based on specific understandings of immigration classifications and judgements regarding who needs and who deserves to access settlement services  the consequences of imposing classifications and eligibility criteria upon categories of immigrants are significant for both the individual who is further isolated when made to feel as a subcitizen and for the agencies and institutions that serve the needs of these individuals indeed any settlement funding provided by the relevant government department immigration refugees and citizenship canada formerly citizenship and immigration canada generally comes with strings in the form of eligibility requirements attached such was the case for the library settlement partnerships lsp which was funded by then citizenship and immigration canada starting in  in a dozen communities throughout ontario the aim of lsp was to bring settlement workers inside public libraries to provide one to one services and referrals the original lsp guidelines clearly state that settlement services at the public library were for permanent residents persons who have been deemed to be a convention refugee or in need of protection live in caregivers and persons whose in canada application for permanent residence has been approved in principle operational guidelines for library settlement partnerships cited in roberts  as illustrated by the lsp example public libraries do not operate in a vacuum as publicly funded institutions circumstances in this case funding may dictate to librarians whom they should serve and what constitutes their publics even if these conditions clash with their core ethics and values the first step in imagining meaningful lam engagement with refugees is to acknowledge that libraries and other information institutions are themselves institutions of the white nationalist state it is well documented that public libraries participated in americanization
  the library quarterlyand canadianization projects that aimed at educating and assimilating newcomers to the belief systems values and languages of white culture jones   we must therefore be mindful and wary of the lam sectors past and present participation in and complicity with discourses and policies that construct a refugee as other or as the not quite citizen who must be taught our values language and culture in a one way exchange we call on lams and specifically the professionals working within them to consider all people as always part of our constituency regardless of their status judicial or otherwise vis avis the nation state to do so is to reimagine who our public is and to reconceptualize in turn what the public in public library really means it requires an expansive definition of who we are mandated to serve that takes us beyond the citizennoncitizen binary as part of adopting an antiracist stance that refuses to acquiesce to the notion that those living in and contributing to our societies can be declared illegal aliens or that disavows our relations with people around the world it also means understanding that information institutions and professionals must integrate with and adapt to the cultures values and languages of refugees as much as refugees need to integrate and adapt to our institutions and professions if we acknowledge a need for such an antiracist stance premised on the idea that the library is a space for all what are our responsibilities in cases when the funder dictates whom we can or cannot serve when we are asked to run programs and services that seek to assimilate rather than foster reciprocal exchange and transformation or when information we gather or spaces we run expose undocumented and nonstatus people to capture and deportation librarians do indeed have a long tradition of providing settlement services to refugees immigrants and other migrants in the form of esl classes translation services and resources for those seeking assistance with various aspects of resettlement in the new country caidi allard and quirke  pyati  kennan et al  lloyd et al  lloyd  quirke  allard  bowles glass and ngan  the delivery of settlement and citizenship oriented programs are certainly important services that libraries provide but we have already indicated the need to ensure that these programs are provided to all those who need them not only those deemed by governments and funders as eligible we also have suggested the need to critically assess the assimilationist imperatives underpinning many such programs and the need for new approaches moreover the focus on only certain aspects of resettlement usually until one becomes a permanent resident masks other potential needs in emphasizing the provision model and specific types of services eg settlement and citizenship services libraries act as participants in the broader neoliberal project of producing citizens and productive workers stevenson   see also luyt  for his examination of how reader advisory services played a similar function instead we can for example consider the needs of patrons who are arriving from places of conflict and war or who are affected by such violence in that regard librarians in the united states have recently prepared for the possibility of the forced removal of patrons by immigration officials see eg griffey 
negotiating borders  to assess how libraries might better incorporate programming that supports healing and coping with trauma we can also consider what assets refugees bring that can be harnessed and shared with librarians and the publics we serve we also need to make more space for the wide range of linguistic cultural and other needs that patrons have although multilingual collections are usually available in public libraries their small size and lack of availability in most branches become a deterrent similarly the search function in the library catalog often makes it difficult for patrons especially those who do not speak the official language very well if at all to navigate through the multilingual materials available at the public library and locate an item in the catalog last what new programming can be offered newcomers whose library literacy may be nonexistent are new cultural interfaces and modes of engagement deployed we argue that reframing how we imagine our obligation to refugees might encourage us to reconsider the services we offer it would also provide us an opportunity to reflect on our modes of engagement with the publics we serve specifically how would taking colonialism and racism into account reframe who we think of as our public and the way we serve them how do we ensure that our libraries do not inadvertently or deliberately keep some people out whether because of the requirements of funders or otherwise and how do we allow ourselves to be altered by our relationship with these communities at the level of our practices beliefs spaces and tools and what are the consequences of doing so helping refugees adopt contribute to and benefit from the established system is an admirable thing if simultaneously the system is also transformed in a way that accounts for the influx of different cultural linguistic and social capital at a time when librarians are being constantly asked to communicate the value of what they do with the help of moult metrics and other forms of audit this may be an opportune time to reflect on the frameworks within which they operate eg the library as space the service provision model the emphasis on information needs and gaps the nonneutral classification schemes it may well be that our challenge as lis professionals remains one of true engagement with our communities outside the space of the library and outside the models and frameworks that characterize so much of the service provision paradigm that we are accustomed to in reflecting on the future of the mlis and lis professions bertot et al  note the imperative of apprehending the broader ecosystem in which information services are provided and of lis professionals acting as dynamic people persons able to work with a broad spectrum of individuals and being comfortable with implementing change and innova  in the new to canada section of the toronto public library website an individual left the following post on the comments section honestly this post illustrates the problem tpl is having with its outreach there is nothing in the post in arabic only a tiny fraction of the syrians arriving here speak any english at all most dont know what a library system is how does the tpl imagine this information is going to actually reach syrians or other arabic speakers google translate is the best friend fur us helping syrian families but it only goes so far its exhausting to use please if you at the tpl are at all serious about reaching out do something more than provide the one pager in arabic that i picked up for our sponsored family get some content in arabic up build a bridge or two im sorry to say i entirely disagree with shelley abovethis post to me demonstrates a huge blind spot tpl
