a plan for a comprehensive medico historical library problems of scope and coverage william jerome wilson development of a microfilm acquisition program d _ocumentary photography especially in the form of microfilm microprint and the microcard has worked its way gradually almost insidiously into the techniques of the modern library and has confronted librarians with possibilities and problems not dreamed of in their earlier philosophies nowhere perhaps have the effects been more revolutionary than in the rare book field here photography was at first mainly an aid to the reference service presently it was employed also to fill out defective copies of old and rare volumes many of which had been partly worn out with use in this sort of work the army medical library was something of a leader during world war ii when it set up its history of medicine divrision in cleveland as the depository for its rare books a systematic missing pages program was established in order to fill out mutilated or defective books by means of photostats or photoprints from copies in other libraries but if there could be a missing pages program why not also a missing books program why might we not by microphotography obtain from other libraries copies of whole works or of whole sets or senes of works which they possessed and we did not in the year i the history of medicine division undertook a program of this sort with a view to rounding out the library collection of early medical works since the subject area was fairly restricted it seemed reasonable to hope that we thus might acquire all the available early literature in the field or if not all at least most of it in our more sanguine moments we talked openly of our plan for a complete medico historical library but usually we spoke of it discreetly as comprehensive rather than complete or in a still more noncommittal mood we called it simply our microfilm acquisition program as a practical measure to divide the project up into manageable sections it was decided to take up one century at a time beginning with the sixteenth the acquisition diiemxa of te rare book iubrary experience seems to show that there is nothing so appealing to the users of a library or so stimulating to the staff as an active acquisition program even the use of the collections for reference and circulation does not have quite the vitalizing effect that comes from the steady influx of additional materials it provides a constant challenge of fresh intellectual problems and lessens the temptation to regard the library as an inert mass of books unfortunately theseprinciples though admirable in theory are not always easy to apply in a historical library with fixed chronological limits an active program of acquisitions is increasingly difficult to maintain new books in the strict sense of the word are unobtainable accessions in such a library consist usually 
a comprehensive medico historical library  of copies of additional old books that appear from time to time in the auction catalogs and in the offerings of secondhand dealers the prices are high and because of the increasing rarity of the items they seem destined to go higher and higher only extraordinary endowments or appropriations can stand the strain of a really active acquisition program in any of the rare book fields efforts have been made to establish co operative acquisition programs but in historical libraries their success has been limited in the nature of the case they can be little more than agreements to divide the field according to subject interest while maintaining a union catalog and an interlibrary loan system the main point is that each institution in the group shall specialize in its purchases and thus relieve to some extent the competition for books in other fields this is a sort of voluntary rationing which tends to reduce the demand for the commodity in question but does nothing to increase the supply for the fundamental acquisition problem this type of interlibrary co operation is obviously no real answer microphotography as a partial solution a better answer though not a perfect one is possible through the photographic reproduction of books for years it has been evident that the photocopying of texts in other libraries had important possibilities not only for the reference division but also for the acquisition division of a historical library as yet however its possibilities as an acquisition tool have not been fully exploited for this fact there have been various reasons among them the conservatism of librarians an understandable coolness of rarebook dealers toward such innovations and most important of all the amount of preparation necessary for a comprehensive program of photocopying in a particular historical field the conservatism of librarians is probably no stronger than that of other professions but it naturally makes them regard a photocopy as a poor substitute for a book such in many respects it is most of the sentimental values and many of the artistic and craftsmanly qualities of the original are lost in the facsimile and yet the basic use and purpose of the book namely the conveying of information from mind to mind remains for historical study of the text an accurate facsimile is just as good as the book itself as for the rare book dealers they have had relatively little influence on this matter but their economic interest has naturally aligned them with the more conservative librarians in disparaging the photocopy as compared with the book in reality the threat of the facsimile to the dealer monopoly is not very great the lure of the first edition in perfect condition will continue to be strong though the cripples may become a little more difficult to sell moreover in the long run the technique of photocopying by spreading the knowledge and appreciation of historical treasures should widen the rare book market and so help to maintain values problems of scope in a medicohistorical library neither the conservatism of librarians nor the economic concern of dealers has kept the facsimile from being fully exploited as an acquisition tool in historical libraries the real hindrance is the large intellectual effort necessary for its effective use the first problems to come up when such a program is launched are those of scope and coverage what range of subjects to include and how complete
 the library quarterly ly to represent the existing literature on each subject such problems are especially hard for an institution like the library of congress which is presumed to take all knowledge for its province in the army medical library confined as it is to medicine the question of scope is simpler yet even so there is considerable difficulty in delimiting the field and deciding how many of the fringe subjects should be included the question of the completeness of coverage is equally baffling manifestly not every medical and near medical record can be collected even with the aid of microphotography what degree of completeness then ought to be attempted shall the library try to cover with equal thoroughness the early centuries when books were copied by hand the first hundred years or so of printing when the scribes and the printers still competed with each other and the more recent centuries in which the printing press reigns supreme and its output is overwhelming finally after these questions of policy are settled there are practical difficulties a comprehensive program of facsimile acquisition faces an almost limitless problem of searching the obvious tool would be a complete medical bibliography if such a thing existed since it does not the only recourse is to use all available national regional and other bibliographies as well as the catalogs of important libraries the basic literature practical and theoretical defining the scope of a medico historical collection involves a number of close distinctions medicine it is commonly said is both a science and an art art in this case however denotes not an esthetic but a technological aspect it is what the medieval writers commonly called practica as distinguished from theorica a generation just past would have called it an applied as opposed to a pure science the two thingscall them science and art theory and practice or what you will constantly react upon each other and actually cannot exist without each other and yet medicine proper in its most characteristic aspect would seem to be a technology it has concerned itself in all ages and all countries with such matters as diseases and wounds symptoms and diagnosis treatment and remedies these constitute the great main core of a medico historical collection they are medical subjects in the most typical sense and on them an institution like the army medical library must concentrate its primary attention these subjects tend to divide under numerous subheads all of which are still unmistakably medical surgery is one of the great main branches and dentistry is an important branch of surgery treatises on the fitting of eyeglasses the training of deaf mutes and the correction of posture or foot defects all deserve to be included in a medico historical collection what however of veterinary science is animal medicine a medical subject put in this form the question answers itself in practice the matter is simply one of definition if a collection is dedicated to the records of human medicine only then animal medicine is excluded if it is dedicated to medicine generally then veterinary science is a part of it the army medical library i henry e sigerist paper on the historical aspect of art and medicine in buletin of the instisute of the history of medicine iv    seems to equate the artist art and the artisan art in order to put artist and physician closer together than i think they are

 the library quarterly on which their scientific progress depends circumstances may change but at the moment these subsciences are in about the same position as was botany before oo the fringe literature near medical and part meical there is another end to this spectrum all the older sciences had crude and magical beginnings and the medical sciences were no exception back of the herbals and for several centuries contemporaneous with them as well there were elaborate treatises in greek on the virtues of plants of stones of anximals of birds and of fishes one of the bestknown compilations of this sort acquired the peculiar name of the kyranides it was widely circulated also in latin and arabic translations in such works the effort toward dassification may be recognized as a rudimentary manifestation of the scientific spirit but the alleged virtues or powers greek wamels latin virutes or less commonly poteniae are on the order of magical charms thus a certain stone worn as an amulet may ward off weapons in battle a certain fish properly prepared and eaten restore the memory the juice of a certain plant protect from the plague etc the student of historical developments will see here the background of the later sciences of botany mineralogy zoology ornithology and ichthyology and will admit a slight medical slant in some of the socalled virtues but one can hardly accord to such compilations the dignity of medical science they have a little medical interest and a comprehensive medico historical library ought probably to contain representative samples but they are far from being its primary concern in the same category are most of the works on alchemy predecessor of chemistry this was a two sided science which sought in one of its lines of endeavor to find the philosopher stone a perfect medicine which should cure all the ills to which mankind is heir here to some extent is the language of physicans but the content is almost pure magic the same is true of most treatises on astrology whose predictions are on the soothsayer level although some of them as noted above were employed in medical diagnosis not essentially different are chiromancy and physiognomy which seek to foretell human fortunes from the lines of the hand or the shape of the head diseases are sometimes included among their predictions of disaster but these are examples of soothsaying not of medicine for all such pseudosciences as well as for the compilations of virtues perhaps the best designation would be nearmedical in a medico historical collection they are at best only fringe subjects magic in its prescientific and pseudoscientific manifestations is not the only source of near medical works sermons and theological treatises sometimes discuss problems of health and sickness especially during epidemics in  for example domenico dominic bishop of brescia composed a closely reasoned tract on the duty of the clergy in time of pestilence was a prelate bound to stay with his people while a plague was raging or might he flee to some safer place here is a matter with undoubtedly medical implications but it is treated from an ecclesiastical point of view the same problem is present with respect to the lives of st roche and other patrons of physicans and of their patients liturgical works also often indude special prayers to be said for the sick s cf d m schullian a manuscript of dominici in the army medical library journal of ike history of medcine and auied scinces iii  s

 the library quarterly works on the culinary art may touch on matters of diet and those on gymnastic training may give remedial exercises works on architecture often describe the construction of hospitals works on agriculture usually take up at some point the care of domestic animals their diseases and how to cure them compendiums of law sometimes deal at length with medical jurisprudence attempting to set forth the legal rights and responsibilities of the practitioner in all such texts there is some portion with genuinely medical subject matter though it may not constitute a very large fraction of the whole if one were seeking for them a different label from near medical it might perhaps be part medical problems of coverage for early printed books like the well known apple sorter the director of a comprehensive acquisition project is faced with intellectual decisions all day long after deciding which subjects to cover he must decide how completely to cover them and he soon learns that in such work no rules can be applied woodenly to all types of records and all chronological periods the era of manuscript transmission requires different treatment from the era of printed books while some peculiar problems beset that century or so during which scribes and printers competed for the business of circulating the organized thought of the western world coverage will also differ as between medicine and the medical sciences on the one hand and the nearmedical and part medical works on the other finally there is the practical problem of choosing between the two forms of acquisition the expensive book and the cheaper facsimile if both are available in any given instance selection is easiest by far for books printed in the fifteenth century for there is one simple rule include everything incunabula are not very numerous and it may be assumed that every genuinely medical item that has survived from the fifteenth century possesses some historical value many of the more popular works however were printed not once but several times shall a comprehensive collection aim to include either in book form or on film all known editions what furthermore of translations into other languages and what of condensations paraphrases and commentaries quoting part or all of the original work all of these in a sense are new editions and the general problem here being raised may for convenience be called the problem of edition coverage how complete ought this to be complete edition coverage for the basic literature for fifteenth century books that are strictly within its scope the army medical library is attempting to apply a rule of complete edition coverage the case for it is strong if a new edition is revised corrected or enlarged it obviously contains new historical matter and ought to be represented in a comprehensive collection an edition in another language is also important three points of historical value in a translation are obvious i if it does not actually add any new matter it at least will give the translator understanding of doubtful or ambiguous points in the original in this respect every translation is a critical interpretation  to compilers of medical dictionaries it is always interesting and instructive to see what happens to new technical terms in another tongue some are merely transliterated others actually translated  an edition in a foreign language is clear evidence that a medical
a comprehensive medico historical library  work has extended its influence into a new national or linguistic area condensations paraphrases and commentaries bear similar testimony to an author widening influence in addition to recording new information or shifts of interest and emphasis but what of the simple reprint of all types of new edition this is the most difficult to justify under a principle of complete coverage by hypothesis the text is the same as that of the original edition if so why bother to secure a copy the point is arguable but i think that it is well at least for the early centuries to extend the edition coverage to include mere reprints if they can be obtained in microfilm form the added trouble and expense is not very great three considerations seem to favor such a policy i even a reprint testifies to the breadth of the author influence and thus makes a slight contribution to his biography  while the text remains the same the introductory matter often changes  there is always the possibility that a painstaking biographer will find minor but historically significant variants in an edition that has previously been considered a mere reprint of the original it may be permissible at this point to cast a wary eye toward that murky morass in which bibliographers usually working in centuries after the fifteenthstruggle with vaguely identified issues and variant states and belabor one another with arguments about cancel title pages reissues simultaneous issues broken type and such formidable abstractions as the ideal copy and the consistent unit there is of course no cheaper humor than the merriment of a novice over a form of intellectual investigation which does not happen to appeal to him i mention the difficulties and complexities of descriptive bibliography not to scoff but to classify the basis of such studies is the fact that typesetters in all ages have made mistakes and that early printers often caught misprints and corrected them while a work was going through the press also publishers at times made deliberate variations in titlepage or text the attempt to determine from such corrections and changes which copies of a given edition were issued first and which later is a perfectly legitimate exercise of human ingenuity though some bibliographers have doubtless evolved more elaborate theories as to the first issue of the first edition than the evidence will support the point of present interest however is this such investigations are of value for the history of typography but never i think for the history of medicine it follows that a medico historical collection may stop its coverage with the edition it is under no logical obligation to go further and try to secure copies of all alleged issues issue coverage if the term is not too barbarous may be left to the historians of printing and to any library catering especially to their needs sample coverage for fringe materials for strictly medical treatises including those in the medical sciences the edition is the lower limit of coverage but for near medical and part medical works even edition coverage seems more than can be justified in a comprehensive library on the history of medicine one may reasonably expect to find all the fifteenth century editions let us say of bernard de gordonio lilium medicinae which was the most widely used general compendium on the subject in that period the army medical library having already the other four incunable editions of this important work was proud to be
 the library quarterly able to secure in book form about two years ago the original edition of i it plans as soon as possible to secure film or book copies of the french and spanish translations as well quite different must be one attitude toward a general encydopedia of the sciences such as bartholomaeus anglicus de proprietatibus rerum this contains some significant passages on medicine and a good deal of background material of value to the medical historian the work went through a dozen incunable editions in the onrginal latin and there are a dozen more in other languages the army medical library now has three of the latin editions but none of the french dutch spanish or english versions how much of the total printed record of this work may it reasonably be expected to provide certainly not all of it the logical place in which to look for the whole series would be a universal library like the british museum or better still some historical library aiming to cover comprehensively the history of the natural sciences of all the early near medical or partmedical works probably the outstanding example is pliny the elder historia naturalis it may fairly be classified in both those categories the quantity of medical information in this compendium is very considerable though the quality may leave something to be desired in general it reflects not the higher levels of medicine as derived by the romans from the greeks but the popular levels well mixed with superstition and magic there is also a great deal of information and misinformation regarding plants and herbs minerals and metals stars and planets and others of our fringe subjects edition coverage for such a work ought to be as generous as for any part medical or near medical treatise that can be named as a matter of fact at the army medical library it is quite generous of the fifteen incunable editions recorded by arnold c klebs in his incunabula scientifica et medica four are represented here in book form the fifth eighth ninth and fifteenth of the three incunable editions of the italian translation the first and second are present and there are copies also of seven later editions including english and german translations bearing dates of i i  i xi  i  i  and i is this sufficient or ought an effort to be made to secure in book form or on film the remaining twelve incunable editions here again is a question that is endlessly arguable on it i offer suggestions rather than decisions the real question is not i submit what it would be nice to have or what some scholar might some day ask to see but rather what it would be logical to expect in a comprehensive library on the history of medicine if pliny were a medical writer we should want the entire printed record in order to illustrate the ramifications of his influence and the various additions and alterations that have been made in his text since he is not a medical writer but has only illustrative and background value for the history of medicine it would seem sufficient as a practical working solution of the problem to content ourselves with two things i an early edition preferably the first if it is available and  the best modern critical edition in existence those two would appear to be the indispensable minimum if there is to be any extension beyond this coverage it ought obviously to be in the second category rather than the first as will be brought out more clearly below the piling up of successive incunable editions will hardly bring us nearer to the original
a comprehensive medico historical library  wording of pliny text which is usually what the medical historian wants when he consults a copy of the hiistoria naturalis on the other hand the precise purpose of a modern critical edition is to get back of all the variants that have crept into the manuscripts and the early uncritical editions and to recover as nearly as possible just what pliny wrote if any new and presumably better critical text is ever published the army medical library ought to secure it here rather than among the incunabula is the place for complete edition coverage of nearmedical and part medical works increased selectivity for the later centuries for the genuinely medical literature of the fifteenth century then it is not too ambitious to say include everything that has survived as a matter of fact the same principle may reasonably be applied to the sixteenth century as well beyond that point if a comprehensive acquisition project still seems a feasible undertaking there will inevitably be a tightening of the principles of selection for one thing scope will probably be defined more narrowly and the fringe subjects will be more and more rigidly excluded in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries medicine and its subsidiary and allied subjects were pretty much interrelated not to say confused in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the disciplines became much better distinguished in the nineteenth and twentieth the trend toward specialization became acute although even today the sciences interact on one another about as much as they ever did thinkers and writers when they deal with such interactions as for example between medicine and subatomic physics or between medicine and aviation show greater skill at concentrating on the precise points of medical concern the result is sharper contact and less confusion between the disciplines than formerly to put the matter a little differently the director of a comprehensive medico historical library when he comes to take over for historical purposes the materials of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries will find the scope already determined for him through the refined specialization of science itself what will not have been so well done for him is the segregation of the historically significant from the insignificant here is a problem for archivists and librarians alike if the archivists have faced it a little longer and more consciously than have librarians this is doubtless because archival documents contain a higher percentage of trivial and routine matter than do books certain events or persons in history stand out for their special contributions they mark a new discovery an improved method a critical insight an important change of direction on the other hand the great generality of events and of persons is routine and trivial these the historian can only treat statistically ignoring individual differences and contenting himself with generalizations as to the nature and significance of thousands or millions of similar persons or circumstances in documenting the outstanding events of the past the archivist or the historical librarian will make few mistakes the records of a vesalius a harvey or a jenner will be well chosen and carefully preserved but what of the ephemera the trivia the routine and repetitive publications for example the medical schools publish not merely annual catalogs and lists of courses but also a varied promotional literature all of it bearing though often slightly on the history of medicine

o the library quarterly of what was said it is of course a commonplace in university circles that classroom lectures represent books not yet well enough organized to print when recorded in a student notes they are likely to be even less well organized such manuscripts usually are significant only if the professor was very illustrious or the student became so a particularly disappointing type of manuscript is the simple copy of a printed book this is likely to have originated toward the end of the fifteenth or the beginning of the sixteenth century though some instances occur much later in the greek speaking or russian speaking world they are fairly common down to the eighteenth or even nineteenth century since in those parts of europe the rise of printing was long delayed at the time when scribe and printer were in competition and printed books though cheaper than manuscnrpts were still costly an impecunious scholar sometimes thought it better to transcribe a book than to buy it for his own use such a transcript is obviously less valuable than the book from which it was taken since it is bound to contain some errors in copying as a matter of fact those manuscript copies of printed books are among the most annoying that modern librarians have to deal with since the copyist was seldom if ever a professional scribe but was a private scholar making the transcript for his own use he was apt to be careless about identifying the work he was quite likely to omit place and date of printing and fairly likely to omit the author of all the means of identification the title is the one most commonly preserved but this by itself is not much of a clue there is always a chance when such a manuscript comes on the market that it may be a hitherto unknown treatise on the subject with this kind of hope which dealers seem to do little to discourage more than one librarian has bought the piece only to find after painstaking research that the entire text had been previously printed unless the manuscript copy contains additions to the published work which are significant on their own account both the money and the investigative effort spent on the volume have been largely wasted manuscripts written before the invention of printing in its own proper period before the invention of printing the manuscript is a very different thing here it is the medium practically the sole medium for articulate records from the past pictures statues buildings even monuments with inscriptions on them tell but little regarding the actual thinking of earlier peoples manuscripts tell a great deal if an early writer own autograph copy has survived we have his ideas preserved in his own language just as accurately as if the work had been issued in print though it may be much harder to read if the autograph has disappeared later copies may have survived but these especially if several times removed from the original may vary considerably there are sure to be errors in wording probably some omissions and possibly some interpolations as well the degree of variance does not depend mathematically on the number of recopyings one really careless scribe can do more damage to a text than a succession of a dozen skilled copyists students of these matters sometimes make a distinction between protected and unprotected texts the protection can only be accorded by some interested and continulng profession or organization thus the government and the courts were concerned for the preserva
