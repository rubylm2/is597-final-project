developing a library school course in government statistics john r heintz statistical information is one of the most important forms of government publication librarians receive some training in how to locate and use government statistical information in reference or government documents classes but the coverage is usually cursory and most librarians could use more education this paper reviews the literature and available print and electronic statistical resources and outlines a course for librarians in government statistics suggesting classroom or self study instructional methods identifying key information on search strategies ready reference sources and detailed topical statistical sources and suggesting issues for librarians to be aware of in helping their patrons locate and use statistics introduction knowledge of the available government publications resources is critical for reference librarians many librarians believe that students under use government documents faculty members contacted in one survey believe that government information is at least somewhat important  percent and that their students rarely or never  percent use government publications in papers this mismatch between faculty expectation and student performance suggests a role for reference librarians in helping students identify and use government documents past treatments of the preparation of librarians suggest that most library and information science lis schools only provide one elective course in government publications that the subject matter is also discussed in a cursory fashion in other reference or collection development courses and that some writers believe more coursework is necessary one survey of government documents librarians suggests that even those who took government publications courses in graduate school often did not feel that their preparation was very good  percent responded satisfactory or poor when asked about the quality of their preparation in addition  percent felt that library schools should offer more training which should emphasize federal and state government information and online sources according to morehead the dissemination of statistical data like legal information has always been a crucial component of the information policies of governments assuming this is true one would think that library school government publications courses would cover statistical informaj of education for library and information science vol  no summer  issn    association for library and information science education  
  journal of education for library and information science about the author john p heintz is reference librarian charles j keffer library university of st thomas minneapolis minnesota ms received  accepted  revised  tion in some depth however because of the wide range of government publications available these courses can typically only give cursory treatment to statistical sources for certain types of librarians like government documents and academic social science librarians this will not adequately familiarize them with the search strategies and range of resources available in government statistics while certainly these librarians will learn on the job it would be desirable for them to have a formal course available to provide a more in depth treatment of the subject such a course could take the form of a special topics seminar or independent study course in a library school or could be offered as a formal course or online self study module sponsored by a library association or consortium this article will outline such a course by suggesting classroom or self study instructional methods identifying key information on search strategies print and online ready reference sources and more detailed topical federal government statistical sources available that such a course should convey to librarians and suggesting issues for librarians to be aware of while helping their patrons locate and use statistics methods traditional reference instruction methods should be utilized to teach this course for librarians if offered in a formal classroom setting lecture topics should include overviews of search strategies issues in finding and using statistics and information on locating and using the various finding aids and sources these lectures should be supplemented by guest appearances by reference librarians discussing the types of statistical questions typically posed by patrons and how to address them additionally the instructor could ask professors from various disciplines what types of statistical information they want students to become familiar with and use in their research searches library students should be given topical scavenger hunt type question and answer assignments requiring them to track down sources in print and online to answer questions posed by the instructor  these would then be discussed in class to reinforce the search strategies and use of the sources and to share information and experiences on the alternative routes to find
developing a library school course in government statistics   ing information these assignments could be done either individually or collaboratively depending on instructor preferences presentations class participants should be required to research particular sources or topics and prepare pathfinders for formal presentation to the class paper library students would prepare a formal research paper on an appropriate topic in government statistics tutorials in a less formal setting or as a component of a formal course a web based curriculum could be developed to cover some of the lecture format and scavenger hunt materials a number of library based statistics tutorials exist on the web for example cruse and dedecker have developed a web tutorial entitled how to effectively locate federal government information on the world wide web this useful site while it could stand some updating of sources covers topics such as federal government structure search engines and indexes legal information and a section on statistics demographics and other useful data each section includes a brief discussion list of key sources with hyperlinks and ends with a series of scavenger hunt questions with answers provided another useful statistics tutorial site is sponsored by the milner library at illinois state university this site provides basic information like general definitions of statistical terms descriptions of various types of statistics how to evaluate authenticity reliability and relevance of statistical data how to locate and retrieve uncompiled data for processing and search strategies and lists of sources tutorial sites like these should be used as part of the formal instruction for a course both for their substantive content and as examples of resources that librarians can develop on the web to better serve patrons text a primary text for the course could be sears and moody using government information sources electronic and print this standard reference work contains well over  pages specifically targeted to statistics search strategies finding aids and explanations of key sources readings in the text would be supplemented by appropriate journal articles some suggested in this article chapters from other texts and current newspaper or magazine coverage of statistical issues or current events that can be illuminated by the use of government statistics course content the course should be organized to cover five major areas of inquiry
  journal of education for library and information science  the federal statistics gathering environment  search strategies and finding aids  census information  topical areas and sources  issues for librarians to consider in using statistics the federal statistics gathering environment this topic would provide an institutional overview of which federal agencies collect statistics and why the collection and dissemination of statistical information in the federal government is a massive and complex undertaking the president fiscal year  budget request for major statistical programs in the federal government exceeded   billion employing more than  federal workers there are fifteen principal statistical agencies listed on the fedstats website and a total of one hundred comprising cabinet departments and bureaus within them independent agencies the various national institutes of health and interagency collaborative efforts it is important to present an overview of this agency structure explaining which agency produces which statistics and for what purpose this information is important both as general context and to inform an agency based search strategy which is one method used to find statistical data this section should also cover how statistics are used for federal program planning evaluation and management setting grant benefit levels and distribution formulas legislative oversight and other issues herman locating united states government information has a chapter discussing these and related issues this presentation would also explain the roles played by the office of management and budget omb and the federal interagency council on statistical policy omb as part of its regulatory function issues technical standards defining key statistical terms and collection methods and arbitrates disputes regarding such topics  the council provides a forum for discussing technical issues among agencies and produces the fedstats website other online databases for statistical information include rdsgale tablebase and the federal commerce department stat usa other key sources for this topic would include  the fedstats website which provides a reference shelf of standard statistical compendia topical agency and agency subject indexes for locating statistics descriptions of the statistics available statistics by geography and mapping tools and information on federal statistical policy  statistical programs of the united states government a congressionally mandated annual report from omb on funding and policy issues surrounding federal statistics search strategies and finding aids this section of the course would rely heavily on sears and moody  descriptions of statistical search strategies  they identify a general five step statistical search strategy ready reference statistical compilations census treated separately below indexesdatabases and web search
developing a library school course in government statistics   engines the first two of these ready reference and statistical compilations involve checking for needed information in the statistical abstract of the united states or other standard compilations like the city and county databook and cia world factbook these are standard approaches taught in all basic reference courses however an additional important source to be covered is the census bureau  historical statistics of the united states a two volume set that collects statistics from a myriad of sources and provides annotated notes to additional sources that readers can find in other works  the course should provide a quick review of these ready reference tools with a reminder to students that they include references to more detailed original publications concerning a given topic and as a result can be used as an effective index supplementing sears and moody herman work on this topic has a separate chapter on ready reference statistical sources that can be consulted for a more detailed treatment there are a handful of important indexesdatabases for finding statistical information with which librarians should become familiar according to sears and moody consulting indexes and databases is an important part of the statistical search strategy and is usually carried out when searches in the known sources    have been exhausted the first of these indexes is congressional information service cis american statistical index available in print volumes or online as part of lexis nexis statistical universe while this tool is not available in all libraries librarians should become familiar with the searching capabilities and techniques of statistical universe as part of this course statistical universe is divided into three major sections power tables abstracts and links power tables allows a searcher to search for specific kinds of statistical tables a useful search interface allows users to enter keyword terms such as health insurance coverage or population and minnesota or to consult a subject index for terms and then narrow a search based on geographic demographic economic and frequency criteria finally searchers can select periods of coverage limit to documents with excel spreadsheet data and find forecast or projection data abstracts features the same search interface but instead of tables the search returns abstracts and accession information allowing searchers to determine whether or not to obtain a particular publication or view it online links is simply a rather short list of government statistics agencies that is done better on the fedstats website a second index for students to become familiar with is the gale group statistics sources this two volume work contains detailed annotated references to thousands of statistical sources both governmental and private the main body of the text is organized as a simple alphabetical subject index the front matter contains a selected bibliography of key statistical sources including a summary of census bureau and other agency publications and databases finally sears and moody itself is an excellent finding aid that should be in all reference collections where patrons often have occasion to seek government documents and statistics sears and moody assert that providing access to electronic publications
  journal of education for library and information science and information through the world wide web is now one of the primary ways that government agencies distribute information the use of web search engines has become essential in accessing government information obviously a course in federal statistics will require a thorough grounding in how to find them on the web both as part of general search strategy discussions and in studying specific topical areas the firstgov portal and search engine is a key web search tool in seeking federal statistical information librarians taking the course will also need to become thoroughly familiar with the fedstats site discussed previously focused search engines like google uncle sam and some important web directories that contain significant links to statistical resources many library websites around the country provide very well done lists of links to statistical sources which can be a quick way to access the information among several the most important of these is probably the university of michigan library government document center statistical resources on the web site this comprehensive site is organized into  topical areas with a much larger subject index of links to almost any conceivable topic the site also links to the inter university consortium for political and social research icpsr which provides access to large volumes of raw statistical microdata for affiliated member institutions another good statistics directory is the university of north texas united states statistical agencies and information which organizes links to general statistical compilations statistics by topic a directory of federal statistical agencies and a list of statistical indexes finally any discussion of statistical search strategies must address terminologies to be used in searching statistics and demographics have unique terms to describe types of statistics and analyses and these must be examined in addition the complex structure of the agencies involved and the different reasons for which statistics are collected lead inevitably to differences in terminology used to describe data and to confusion about relationships among data series collected by different agencies knowledge of the agencies involved the data collected the relevant vocabulary and search terms to use and how to connect information from different sources can enable librarians to help their patrons locate needed information these issues need to be discussed with examples presented of the various terms used and how researchers and librarians can go about learning the terminology as it exists and as it evolves there are a number of researchers that examine these topics and study the information seeking practices of statistics users in an attempt to improve data collection practices search engines and website design to improve the accessibility of information one example of such research is the govstat project whose website httpils uncgovstat provides summaries and links to some of the research documents which might be assigned as class readings or research leads census information sears and moody consider consulting census publications to be a com

developing a library school course in government statistics   statistics course the emphasis would be on illustrating how such techniques are used in the statistical sources themselves how researchers use such techniques to manipulate the data they obtain and common mistakes in the application of the techniques excellent sources for this discussion include a chapter on statistical reasoning in lavin business information how to find it how to use it and two recent articles by gerhan entitled when quantitative analysis lies behind a reference question and statistical significance how it signifies in statistical reference if time permits the discussion could be extended to cover how data can be extracted and manipulated in software tools such as spreadsheet and database programs and statistical software packages like sas or spss another thread in this discussion is the issues surrounding data accuracy construction and interpretation library literature treatment of the authority of reference sources typically views government supplied information as authoritative but is it necessarily so government statistical information is subject to sampling measurement and estimation errors non response bias and other problems of survey construction certain types of publications may contain an administration or partisan bias government data series are also frequently revised after initial publication similar types of data presented by different agencies may be collected using different methods and yield conflicting and confusing results and the same data series may change methods between collections resulting in comparability problems over time the treatment of race and ethnicity in government statistics programs is fraught with controversy and can lead to problems of accuracy comparability and proper interpretation helping librarians understand and grapple with these issues provides important context to statistical reference several sources previously cited touch on these issues other references are stratford responding to reference queries for numeric data and the problems inherent in interpreting statistical sources a noteand robbin the problematic status of us statistics on race and ethnicity an mperfect representation of reality  conclusion government statistics is an area where most reference librarians could expand their knowledge certainly academic business and government documents librarians have an expanded need for knowledge of statistical data sources and uses this paper has attempted to outline an appropriate curriculum for delivering some ofthat knowledge while this author makes no claim to complete coverage of the appropriate topics the material described here is a good representation of the basics useful as preparation for prospective librarians or as continuing education for practicing ones what remains is for library school professors or practicing librarians to agree with the need to deliver such a curriculum and to do so in formal classes or for a professional association or library consortium to develop appropriate web based materials or continuing education classes to address it
