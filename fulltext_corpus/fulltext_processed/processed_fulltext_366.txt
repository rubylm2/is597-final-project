documentation information retrieval and other new techniques mortimer taube in the invitation which i received from dean asheim with reference to this paper i was asked to cover the total area of development of documentation and information retrieval from an objective and theoretical point of view rather than from any narrowly conceived concern with special techniques or special equipment the letter indicated that twenty five years ago when these library institutes were initiated the topic assigned to me was not even considered a part of librarianship the fact that twenty five years later the topic should be considered an essential part of your deliberations is the first important fact that should be noted how did this new development arise out of traditional librarianship what were the outside forces beyond librarianship whichcontributed to its development will it remain a separate enterprise or will it invest librarianship in general and change its very nature answers to questions like these make this subject germane to an institute organized and sponsored by a graduate school of librarianship alfred north whitehead once remarked tlat all knowledge begins with the enterprise of classification this enterprise involves naming things separating things and distinguishing between things in simple terms of likeness and unlikeness he went on to say that such classification is only the beginning of science and that if you stop at classification without going on to mathematics you have not progressed very far what he meant by going on to mathematics is not necessarily going on to technical mathematics in the form of elaborate equations deductions proofs theorems etc but going on to a recognition that the differences with which science is concerned can be treated as differences along a variable in other words from a scientific point of view the differences between classes or kinds are not absolute but merely points of emphasis along continuous variables this of course is the major theoretical insight of evolutionary theory in biology and distinguishes darwin from linnaeus we may classify things as red things and green things and if we remain at this level we have an absolute difference between green and red green is green red is red green is not red red is not green and that is the end of the matter on the other hand we may recognize that the color phenomena represent different wave lengths and in such terms we can understand that there is a mathematical or a continuous variation in color from red to green consider this same situation with reference to the relationship between librarianship and documentation one might say librarianship is librarianship documentation is documentation librarianship is not documentation documentation is not librarianship and end the matter but this is to end it on a low empirical or linnaean level if we are to be scientists in the modern sense 
documentation and other techniques  we must look for a variable or a set of variables such that traditional librarianship and new developments in documentation and information retrieval represent different quantities or different modes of emphasis in a continuum a more specific illustration of what we are after can be found in the following story early in  i had arranged with the graduate library school of the university of chicago to teach a course in some of the new developments in information handling i was asked for a name for the course which could be put in the catalog or the announcement to students and i suggested the standard term cataloging or if you will advanced cataloging i was advised not to use such a name because the students would not take such a course i then suggested the more glamorous term documentation i may say that it got me students but it has created a problem ever since of explaining what documentation is and it is this explanation which still involves us at this time one thing which seems completely obvious is that cataloging in the sense in which it is practiced in all libraries is a form of information retrieval items are described by catalogers in certain ways the items are put away on shelves and they are retrieved by using the descriptions placed on the catalog cards the most elaborate mechanized system of information retrieval does no more than this in one case we talk of getting a book from the shelves in the other we talk of retrieving information which is also getting a document or book from the shelves or other type of store this is the first instance of the general requirement of understanding differences as variables along a continuum there have been writers in this field who have made sharp distinctions between retrieving information and retrieving a physical item which contains the information i think it is a simple matter to show that the differences here are differences in degree the information which is retrieved is always physical it is a message of some kind it may differ from a total article or book only in being smaller or in being a summary statement of a larger work but what is retrieved is ultimately determined by what is stored namely the nature of the item that is indexed or cataloged if i catalog a piece of data such as the constitution of an alloy or the biological effect of a compound this is the kind of data i will retrieve and cataloging and retrieving such data do not differ in principle from cataloging and retrieving a book what i am suggesting here is that the basic variable connecting librarianship with newer developments in documentation and information retrieval is just the concept of information this means that one of the essential differences between standard library practices and the newer developments of documentation and information storage and retrieval is just the difference in degree of analysis and the size of the items stored i must enter one important caveat at this point in ordinary conversation people are likely to assume that whereas differences in kind are important differences in degree are unimportant i think this view is completely and utterly wrong all important differences are differences of degree because these are the differences with which science is concerned and which determine the techniques and devices we require in operating different systems before i go on to discuss the implications of the differences in degree be
 the library quarterly tween librarianship and documentation for such things as training of personnel type of service equipment etc something must be said about the nature of the variable itself namely information in the past several years there has been considerable discussion in both technical journals and the public press of the creation of a new basic theory namely information theory fortune magazine has gone so far as to say that the creation of information theory is an intellectual advance as important as the theory of gravitation and that it will have the kind of consequences in the field of information that newton theory of gravitation had in mechanics and physics alongside this most laudatory view there have been many who have been quite resentful of what they have called the pre emption of a word like information to cover certain mathematical relationships which have nothing to do with information as ordinarily understood it has been said that even shannon himself regrets the fact that he used the word information to describe his theory the fact that the word does have common meanings which are completely disparate from the special meaning in which he employed it has led to a great deal of confusion about the application of his theory for my part i think that the word information was a good choice and even though as used in the theory it may not mean what the man in the street thinks it means divergence between common and scientific meaning is not something which is peculiar to this instance rather it is a recurrent phenomenon in the development of scientific terminology the man in the street thinks he knows exactly what words like space time weight and gravity mean but certainly the meanings which most of us apply to such words in common speech have little relation to the meanings which physics assigns to such words the quantities of information which are discussed and measured in shannon theory have little to do with the notion of being informed but the situation here is really no different from the use of the word color to describe a light wave of a certain frequency such waves are not colored in just the same sense that the information in information theory is not the kind of information we mean when we talk of an informed person i have tried to state this problem in another connection and rather than attempt another statement i repeat the earlier presentation information can be interpreted extensively as a statistical property of messages without any reference to meaning and semantics much of the basic progress of science has consisted in similar discoveries of extensive measures of qualitative relations which in themselves resist the type of mathematical analysis which is the hallmark of science physics does not concern itself with the feeling of warmth the perception of color nor the hearing of sounds but only with measurable energy transformations it describes the color spectrum in terms of light rays of different wave length it describes sounds as different rates of vibration and it leaves to philosophers such questions as is heard sound really a vibration or is the color blue really identical with a wave length of a certain size the growing interest in information theory is symptomatic of a general awareness that a break through has been achieved that a hitherto intractable field of qualitative experience has now yielded to extensive measure the relation between inforrmation as a measurable extensive quantity and meaning as an act or attribute of human understanding is exactly analogous to the relation between wave lengths of light and the perception of color common sense tends to resist the transformation from qualitative immediacy to quantitative measures and only the massive prac francis bello information theory fortune xxviii december  ff

 the library quarterly approximate as closely as we please the meanings which are important to us but if we begin by trying to catch meaning in our gross physical nets we will end in disaster and confusion or as a mystic cult libraries are storehouses of recorded information that is of physical messages in various forms the only instruments we know which store meanings are human beings or if you will the brains of human beings it is true that a library is a combination of physical objects and the people who work with these physical objects but when we are concerned with improving the ways in which we index catalog store and retrieve the physical objects in libraries we are not dealing with a branch of biology that is we are not dealing with the people who work in libraries with so much i will regard the first point as established both libraries and documentation centers both cataloging and information storage and retrieval are concerned with information as a property of physical records they are distinguished from each other as we have said only in degree what emerges from this general conclusion is the recognition that techniques and devices which have been the basis of traditional librarianship are largely founded on the particular nature and physical form of the packages of information with which libraries have traditionally been concerned this physical form as the very name library indicates is the book the form of buildings the type of shelves of libraries are obviously determined by the fact that they handle books but it is not so clearly realized that the very apparatus of cataloging and indexing developed by the library profession is also determined by the fact that the item cataloged and indexed is a book it is true that even traditional libraries have other materials besides books journals periodicals etcbut whereas the library takes on the obligation of cataloging its books in general it buys indexes or catalogs of its periodical and journal holdings by buying another book namely a printed index which some other agency has prepared it is true that historically the libraries played a role in developing the type of indexing publications put out by the h w wilson company the co operative activity of libraries was necessary with reference to these indexes because they are essentially general and there were no learned societies or special scientific bodies which could or would take responsibility for them but when we come to consider specialized indexing services such as chemical abstracts biological abstracts physical abstracts etc and their indexes we must recognize that the library profession as a whole took no responsibility for the preparation of these indexes or for the techniques and theories of information handling on which they are based i have remarked in other places although it bears emphasis again here that what caused the modern development of documentation and the modern concern of librarians with this topic was that a form of literature became important which was neither a book to be handled by the librarians nor a journal article to be handled by a scientific society namely the technical report the technical report as a form of literature is certainly not nearly so important in our culture and our science as are books and journals but as a new form of literature invading libraries and information centers these reports created the
documentation and other techniques  problem of establishing proper indexes and storage and retrieval devices to handle them the traditional techniques of cataloging books were not adequate the librarians or scientists who had been pre empted for the purpose of running information centers found it necessary to develop new techniques sometimes these new techniques were developed in complete independence of regular library activities sometimes they started from such techniques and added various refinements and developments but the important point is that the very problem made it necessary for the librarian to rethink the justification and reasons for his basic and fundamental professional practices although mr wilson paper is concerned with the preparation and use of the professional staff the topic which has been assigned to me cannot be fully covered without pointing out the implications of the doctrine of the informnation continuum for the training of professional workers in this field from the beginnings of librarianship as a field of professional activity through the thirty four years in the life of the graduate library school there have been constant re examinations of curriculums and a constant search for that touchstone which might serve to define a professional librarian and distinguish him from a clerk or technician working in a building called a library the graduate library school found it necessary to develop a set of courses which would be academically respectable so that a university like the university of chicago might grant its doctorate for studies and research in such courses over the years emphasis has shifted from public administration to adult education to surveys of reader attitudes and practices to content courses in the literature of the various scientific and humanistic disciplines there has always been a limited concern with technical matters such as classification or indexing but in general the library profession seemed to feel that the basic problems of cataloging and classification had been resolved around the turn of the century in the discussions among the giants of our profession cutter dewey brown and hanson today in library schools there is more and more a tendency to make cataloging a technical skill and treat it as a pre professional course the renewed interest in methods of organizing information as a professional concern of librarians comes not from the library profession per se although individual librarians may have been involved but from this new field of documentation and information retrieval a field largely dominated by engjneers chemists computer specialists and other groups most interested in information but also most disdainful of the tradition of professional librarianship these outlanders have confronted us with a basic problem either we enlarge our horizons to encompass the basic theoretical interest in information and make a new synthesis or we will be reduced to a trade jealously guarding its knowhow with its eyes on the past rather than the future for more than anything else it is the emphasis on what has been done rather than on what can be done which defines a technical trade in distinction from a scientific profession we must face this question how can the curriculums of library schools be modified to make room for the profession of information theorists what i am saying is that librarianship like supply cataloging and dataprocessing inventory control or traffic control is a form of applied informa
 the library quarterly tion theory and the study of information as a physical property of messages is the basic professional part of librarianship to illustrate what this implies in more concrete terms i present here an outline of a curriculum for the librarian who is concerned with information in just the same sense as the chemist is concerned with the chemical properties of matter  the political science of informationby this i mean a consideration of the organizations active in the field their bases of power in the community the way in which they complement and compete with one another such organizations are the government itself its particular agencies learned societies universities trade associations publishers and industry all such organizations play a part in the creation dissemination and utilization of information an analysis of the parts they play and their interrelations would constitute the political science of information  the logic of informationthis heading covers the general theory of organizing information from its creation through its collection organization dissemination and use it would encompass theoretical studies ranging from indexing through information theory to pure studies in symbolic logic  the mechanics of informationunder this heading would be included all studies of instrumentation ranging from  x  cards to large data processing equipment it would include not only equipment for organizing but equipment for reproducing and disseminating hence it would cover the printing and reproduction arts  the history of informationunder this heading there would be included some of the material under political science heading  that is to say the institutions studied as existing centers of power under political science would here be studied as historical phenomena in terms of their origin and growth in addition this would include the history of scientific publication itself and the growth of various media for scientific communication  the communication of information under this heading there would be included a consideration of information as a communication process imbedded within the total framework of modern society in order to appreciate the particular channels developed and dedicated to library information there would have to be an understanding of the general channels of communication developed by modem society on the basis of his professional knowledge the librarian will structure the particular working environment in which he finds himself by this i mean that such factors as the type of clientele size of collection depth of indexing rate of growth etc will determine how the librarian uses his basic theoretical knowledge of the physical properties of information to structure a particular library to select its devices equipment codes catalogs etc suppose a librarian to be faced with the problem of structuring a medium sized public library or a college library he may decide that the information in his library is best organized in terms of a rough open shelf classification which matches the general division of interests of his clientele he may decide that for those members of his clientele who approach material through authors he will need an author catalog and for those people whose desires may intersect the classification of material on his shelf he may provide a subject catalog for special information needs which are not in general predictable he may provide a reference librarian with a collection of reference books it should be apparent that what i have described is a standard library what i wish to emphasize is that such a structure is really specialized for a particular clientele even though this particular clientele may be made up of a very large group of people and that for other types of clientele this type of structure may be completely unsuitable it is true that in library literature we are likelyto find manv arguments in
documentation and other techniques  favor of this or that type of shelf arrangement in favor of dictionary catalogs or divided catalogs class catalogs or alphabetical catalogs but for the most part these discussions in the literature are completely ad hoc where they have any justification it is usually in terms of the presumed habits or requirements of the readers in the past ten years a considerable literature has accumulated both in the library field proper and in the field of information storage and retrieval on studies of use of literature and information centers various summary analyses of such studies have been compiled by frarey lilley shaw tornudd and myself what emerges is a consensus that studies of use cannot in themselves supply information leading to decision about the type of equipment and system that should be used by any given library or information center even in the library of congress that citadel of tradition and conservatism where one takes off one shoes and genuflects before the  x  card it is generally recognized by the professionals on the staff that the so called public catalog is so called only to distinguish its location from that of the official catalog it cannot be presumed that the public can use in any adequate sense the millions of cards which are euphemistically called the public catalog the filing rules alone not to mention the rules of entry make up a good sized book of esoteric information completely unknown to the public what we can note in the library of congress is the extension of a method devised for a standard public library or small college library to cover the collections of a great research library actually most of the special research collections of the library of congress have separate catalogs and it is recognized by the staff of the library itself that the public catalog is not adequate to exhibit the research potential of even the general collections of the library this has been recognized and set forth in a recent report of a subcommittee of the senate committee on government operations which has been looking into documentation indexing and retrieval of scientific information if the standard shelf classification the  x  dictionary catalog or the divided catalog is the be all and end all of librarianship then librarianship is a clerical operation at worst and a technical operation at best it is not a profession on the other hand if any particular apparatus regardless of how widespread its use or hallowed its tradition is recognized as a particular embodiment of an underlying theory the development of the underlying theory is the professional basis for librarianship it will be this underlying theory which will permit a determination of the most suitable apparatus for any individual purpose or type of library another way of setting forth the relationship proposed here is by considering the analogy presented by preclinical and clinical studies in a medical school the preclinical subjects are the scientific basis of medicine as they are the scientific basis of other types of activities nursing public health sanitation etc information theory is to librarianship as the preclinical subjects of biochemistry physiology anatomy etc are to the practice of medicine without such preclinical subjects medicine s congress senate documentation indexing and retrieval of scientific information a study of federal and non federal science information processing and retrieval programs senate doc  th cong d sess washington dc government printing office 
 the library quarterly reverts to the barbering it once was without information theory librarianship never can advance beyond the technical operation which it now is with so much as a background we can turn at this time to the question which more than any other has dominated library literature in the past decade and is the subject which draws the largest crowds of skeptics neophytes and enthusiasts at our library meetings namely the mechanization of libraries in entering this discussion the first thing which should be made clear is that the only meaningful and fruitful field for mechanization is the field of information handling defined as the physical properties of messages anyone who pretends to mechanize thought processes or the meanings which we convey to one another by means of the physical properties of messages is either a fool or a rogue if mechanization is limited as it should be to the physical properties of messages then it must be recognized that libraries have always been mechanized a typewriter a date stamp a  x  card the book itself not to mention microforms and phonograph records are physical devices or if you will mechanical devices for handling storing transforming and disseminating information the only serious question which is hidden in the torrent of words on the mechanization of libraries is the question as to whether the state of the art with reference to more elaborate devices makes it feasible for institutions known as libraries to adopt forms of mechanization which show real promise of being of service even though they have not hitherto been used in libraries nor discussed to any great extent in our library schools whether or not any particular device or particular system of devices can contribute to the improvement of service of libraries of various kinds may depend in part on changes which can be made in the environment of the devices and the type of service given by the institution any new device may have only limited usefulness until such time as the promise it offers leads to a change in the environment of the device to match that promise consider for example the early use of automobiles in the beginning without paved roads gasoline stations trained mechanics spare parts depots etc such devices were little better than toys and certainly less efficient than a horse and wagon for steady regular transportation requirements but with the improvement of automobiles there came a concomitant improvement or matching of the environment to the needs of a motorized nation so that our present physical environment is almost designed for the maximum utility of automotive transportation in fact there is considerable demand that our very cities be torn down and redesigned to provide roadways and parking for an ever growing number of automobiles certainly one does not undertake to change an environment to match a whim and if the devices now offered to libraries and information centers as a means of greatly improving the control of information did not have real promise it would be silly to consider environmental changes consider the following specific problem in the standard practice of preparing  x  cards for a catalog librarians have learned empirically what can be deduced from information theory namely that new cards should be filed into existing catalogs in batches rather than a single card at a time the
documentation and other techniques  cataloger who completes cataloging a book doesn immediately run downstairs or across the building to the public catalog and file in the cards she or he has completed rather the new cards are cumulated into an in process file and after this in process file grows to a certain size sections of it either letter by letter or several letters at a time are filed into the main catalog this procedure of cumulating in process material is known in the art of mechanized datahandling as batching let me say at once that such a procedure although it leads to efficiency of interfiling also involves some degree of loss of service for example while material is being cumulated in an in process file it is not available to the public users of the catalog in spite of this loss librarians who calculate the costs and pay off of certain activities feel it worthwhile to maintain in process files and to carry out batch interfiling consider the same problem from the reference or output end our present catalogs are designed to answer individual inquiries as they are received by the library or as patrons come to the library with such inquiries it is conceivable that the type of apparatus required to handle such inquiries on an individual basis may get so cumbersome and so costly that it will turn out to be feasible and necessary to batch reference inquiries by this i mean that reference inquiries like new cards for the catalog may be cumulated for several hours or a day and then searched in a batch against a machine store of some kind the user of the library would be told to leave his question and to return at some later time for his answer certainly this will make many library users unhappy and this practice is not being recommended at this time the only point being made is that in principle batching at the output can be justified in the same terms in which batching at the input is now justified having recognized that a change of environment or type of service may be required to obtain maximum utilization of new types of equipment it is necessary to enter a caveat at this time unless the change in equipment and change in environment and service leads ultimately to better service at lower cost it ought not to be undertaken many changes have been made in special libraries which seem to have been motivated solely by the glamor of mechanization without any real concern for the economics of the change or the service potential involved in it one of the things which can be derived from a theoretical basis of librarianship of the kind we have outlined above is a reasonable prediction of the pay off of new procedures and new equipment the discussion thus far has been quite general and you may feel that i have not carried out my assignment unless i come to grips with the specific question of punched card machines or computers in libraries library literature is full of accounts of particular experiments with punched cards and with prognostications of what will happen to the american library when finally computers replace both catalogs and librarians in the first place i think we can dismiss as sheer poppycock the replacement of human intelligence by any mechanical device however complex this means that the problem is not whether or not we substitute a computer for a librarian but how the librarian should use the computer assuming that he ought to use it at all returning to the more simple problem of punched cards most of the litera
 the library quarterly ture on the use of punched card equipment in libraries boils down to the evaluation of two propositions punchedcard devices can eliminate the problem of filing and they can eliminate the problem of multiple cards for a single item when these arguments are examined it is discovered first that the savings in filing costs turn out to be trivial especially when compared with the cost of the machine and second that a busy library of any reasonable size cannot afford the luxury of sorting its total catalog for each inquiry it receives not even the most impassioned devotee of punched cards has ever seriously suggested the replacement of a large  x  card catalog with an unordered deck of punched cards with reference to the elimination of multiple cards once the initial enthusiasm disappeared it was dicovered that the coding potential of a single  column card is rather restricted and that without super imposed coding with many attendant problems which need not concern us at this time a single card is no substitute for the unit card system used in most libraries these negative statements do not mean that punched cards cannot be used in libraries they mean only that we cannot use an unorganized file of punched cards as a substitute for the traditional card catalog it is possible however to organize a file of punched cards under subjects so that very large collections of information can be deeply indexed and searched at a reasonable cost the type of organization required has been variously referred to in the literature as inverted indexing or aspect indexing we will not attempt to describe this method in detail here it has been completely described in many of our previous papers and bn other papers in the literature the important point to note is that its value is a function of the depth of indexing in a library which finds it adequate to utilize one or two subject headings per book this type of indexing would be supererogatory however if a collection of material is to be deeply indexed with five or more entries per item then it will be discovered that the value of co ordinate indexing goes up with the depth of indexing per item we are not by such a statement advocating that all libraries immediately begin programs of deep indexing of their material what we are saying is that the traditional barriers to deep indexing represented by the  x  card catalog need no longer be a barrier if such deep indexing is required either by the type of material or the type of service there are many special libraries which find deep indexing necessary to the fulfilment of their purposes it would be just as silly for such libraries to hold fast to  x  card catalogs as it would be for a standard public library to give up its  x  card catalog in favor of one of the various forms of co ordinate indexing before leaving this question of punched cards something should be said about the use of such devices as means for storing texts for printing in various forms although punched cards can and have been used to compile lists and bibliographies they suffer from many limitations including a very restricted number of characters and serious limitations in the ability to arrange blocks of text these limitations have led recently to an attempt to combine the sorting and handling potentialities of punched cards with the more de taube and associates studies in coordinate indexing vols i v washington dc documentation inc

 the library quarterly general theoretical considerations and it is presented here to illustrate the manner in which an understanding of underlying theory can guide us in the choice of particular devices or systems of mechanization in planning a system of information storage and retrieval one of the conditions which is usually known is the size of the answer which will be an acceptable outcome of a search this size will vary between general and specific questions but in indexing items the indexer is usually aware of what terms are too general and will yield answers too large to be useful similarly the time available to read and digest an answer may determine that an answer consisting of one item is not enough that an answer consisting of one thousand items is too much and that an answer containing between ten to twenty items is optimum it may be concluded then that given the prior knowledge of the optimum size or an average size of an answer it is possible to predict the relative cost of a system which combines code and text as compared with a system which stores code and text separately a full set of mathematical equations remains to be worked out for such a task but the mathematical equations given below are sufficient to illustrate the method and the basis for decision consider system a and system b two systems of information storage and retrieval in which microfilm is used for the storage of both code and text in system a code and text are combined on a single store so that matching the code also delivers a microfilm copy of the text in system b the store is divided into two parts one part containing code and the other part containing text a search of the code store of system b yields addresses which then must be used to search the microfilm containing the text in order to retrieve the ultimate items of search consider a system that is designed to deliver a single answer that is the address of an item in inventory or a particular text satisfying a very special set of index headings the retrieval of a single item from the separate store of system b would require the selection of a single numbered item from a file arranged in numerical order this in principle is the simplest of all retrieval tasks since the position of the desired item is known with reference to all other addresses in the file as the number of answers increases the cost of retrieving the items from the text store of b will increase linearly it will cost twice as much to retrieve two items as one item three times as much for three items etc hence there will be an answer containing n items where n is a subset of i the items in the store so that with reference to system b the cost of retrieving n items from a separate store plus the cost of storing only codes for i items is higher than is the cost of storing i codes and texts in system a contrariwise there will be an average size of n such that the cost of system b will be less than the cost of system a if it is assumed that the size of each text is equal to each code group and that both system a and system b store codes sequentially then the combined single store of system a will equal in size the two stores of system b i in system a will be twice the size of c in system b since the cost of a search of a sequential file increases linearly with its size the average cost of a search of i system a will be twice as much as a search in c system b there will be an additional cost in system b of retrieving items from t thc text store the problem then reduces to determination of whether i  c is greater or less than the cost of retrieving an item from t since the absolute value of i  c is fixed by the size of the system and the number of retrievals from t varies with the size of the answer there will be an average sized answer which is less than i  c and also an average sized answer which is greater than i  c for example since the absolute size of the system will affect the absolute value of i  c even though i  c  t the final mathematical formulation should contain four size parameters  the size of the total system number of items  the size of the code group for an item  the size of the clear text of an item  the size of an average answer number of items system a system b i text store  code store  t text store  c code store
documentation and other techniques  for a prefiled system like the minicard system or filmorex system a will differ from system b not only in higher search costs but in size of the store and hence in the cost of the initial input investment in prefiled systems which combine code and text both code and text are multiplied for each filing position but prefiled systems in which the code is separate from the text need only multiply the code groups and still retain a one place sequential file of texts if we assume n filing positions since i  c  t it will always be the case that ni  nc  t it follows that the average number of answers in a question required to justify system a must be higher when system a is a prefiled system since a prefiled combined system has botk a higher searching cost and a higher input cost than a prefiled system which stores code and text separately this paper is already overly long and there are other particular aspects of documentation which we have not discussed namely the reproduction of materials and their dissemination but in these areas also it will be found that basic theoretical considerations can serve to eliminate ad hoc arguments which have plagued us for years for example one of the limitations which stands in the way of using computer output as finished reports is the limited font on computers namely their restriction to upper case this limitation is especially notable in documentation activities in the field of chemistry in order to print chemical abstracts approximately one thousand different characters are used including upper and lower case italics upper and lower case greek superscripts etc this proliferation of characters is tied to the method of composition for example in setting type by hand it is simpler to reach for a greek a than it is to reach for five separate letters d e l t a on the other hand in a high speed printer one of the crucial parameters is the number of characters on the printing wheel or similar device and it becomes economical to substitute d e l t a for the single character in principle this procedure is identical with the use of binary digits rather than decimal digits in a computer if computers become our printers we are going to have to face a problem similar to that faced by the inventors of printing who were first required to produce fonts whose product could not be distinguished from the work of scribes if we place an equivalent requirement on computer printing we are going to delay advances in the preparation of reports and various kinds of bibliographical apparatus the problem in communication is theoretically identical with the problem of printing communication channels are expensive and if we are willing to accept communications which utilize a low level of redundancy and a minimum number of characters we will make rapid advances in this field but if we hold fast to a tradition without understanding that our tradition is also the result of a mechanical development to which we have become accustomed we will hold back the advances we could make and preserve the library as a nineteenth century institution this is something i am sure that none of us wants a tradition by its very nature is something we should not throw away lightly but we also have the obligation to make new traditions and to avoid the transformation of existing traditions into dogma ased on a working paper prepared for information storage and retrieval theory systems and devices by mortimer taube and harold wooster new york columbia university press  pp
