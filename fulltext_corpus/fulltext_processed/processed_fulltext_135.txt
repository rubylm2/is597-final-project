 the library quarterly an extended debate that revealed the lack of consensus within the association concerning librarians adherence to their intellectual freedom credo and convinced the intellectual freedom committee ifc to pursue a program to indoctrinate librarians in their professional role as defenders of access to all points of view the years immediately following the  adoption of the revised library bill of rights to the ordinary interpretation of which ulveling objected were busy and contentious for the ifc its first eight years had not been so active as evelyn geller forbidden books in american public libraries    recounts librarians had only gradually accepted a role as guardians of the freedom to read adopting in  the initial library bill of rights  which extolled the value of representing all sides of controversial issues but did not specifically prohibit censorship established in  the committee on intellectual freedom to safeguard the rights of library users to freedom of inquiry had gotten off to a slow start while the need for effective action was evident the ifc found it difficult to respond according to   chairman alice higgins who complained about the arduous process of arriving at important policy decisions through correspondence  as world war ii ended the united states found itself facing a world in which the soviet union had expanded its sphere of influence and over which the mushroom cloud of atomic weaponry hung ominously the cold war with all its fears and suspicions had begun if communism was a threat from without many believed it also posed a threat from within federal bureau of investigation fbi director j edgar hoover and the house un american activities committee huac warned against communism insidious influence the federal loyalty program stood as testimony to the dangers public employeesincluding librarians were required to sign loyalty oaths as a condition of their employment many states established antisubversive commit the name was changed in  to the committee on intellectual freedom and later through usage to the intellectual freedom committee  for an overview of the years   see  pp   for name see ibid  for a look at the politics of the time see  for an excellent overview of the period as a manifestation of a recurring pattern of intolerance and repression see   for an excellent contemporary examination of the operation effectiveness and costs both monetary and personal of the federal loyalty program see  for a comparable look at loyalty tests generally see  the types of information gathered by the fbi concerning writers and the uses to which it was sometimes put is examined by  a fascinating collection of case studies about the period can be found in  i a readable study of the house un american activities committee can be found in   in my research in progress i have discovered that between  and  librarians in at least los angeles and oakland california maryland seattle washington and massachusetts were fired for refusing to sign or resigned rather than sign loyalty oaths
segregating propaganda  tees such as california tenney committee which scrutinized not only individuals actions but also their associations and reading materials as ellen schrecker points out in no ivoiy tower mccarthyism and the universities many academics careers were ruined not because of any finding of guilt by one of the investigatory committees but because of suspicion cast upon them by their being called to testify   librarians were confronted more than ever with would be censors who often saw controversial unfamiliar or critical ideas as a threat to the american way of life unable to maintain her efforts on behalf of the ifc higgins resigned as chairman in late   although david k berninghausen librarian at cooper union for the sciences and arts had never been active in ala president paul north rice named him to replace higgins on the strength of an article book banning and witch hunts   which berninghausen had sent to him   under berninghausen leadership and with higgins blueprint for action  the ifc began a period of intense activity this activity pushed the ala to make hard choices that helped define not only its stance with regard to specific intellectual freedom issues but also the identity of librarians as guardians of free access to ideas even questionable ideas the unanimous approval of the strengthened library bill of rights by the ala council in june   was followed immediately by a two year controversy over what if anything the ala should do to protest the use of loyalty oaths and investigations in libraries in february  senator joseph mccarthy of wisconsin launched his series of attacks alleging communists in government itself by late  as the cold war heated into the korean conflict the ifc was forced to respond to demands that libraries remove films from circulation and label books accused of being communist this time of ferment exposed the differences within the ala concerning the role of the librarian in defending the freedom to read the much publicized conflict between ulveling and the ifc epitomized the dilemma in which the ala found itself as it attempted to forge a unified position on intellectual freedom in this difficult period the conflict was at base a struggle between the concept of the librarian as one who provides only those materials that are good for the reader according to the values of the librarian or as one who provides access as a condition of employment these oaths generally included an anticommunist affidavit and in some cases a list of subversive organizations in which the signer had to acknowledge membership  for a discussion of this controversy see  pp    for an earlier much more unanimous attitude of the ala and librarians generally toward censorship and propaganda see 
 the library quarterly to a variety of materials even those on contested and controversial ideas and trusts the reader to make judgments for himself brought on by the problems presented by the handling of propaganda materials the conflict developed at the  annual conference and lasted a full year the seeds for the dissension between ulveling and the ifc were sown in positions taken by the ifc and endorsed by the ala council in response to challenges to library materials from organizations such as the american legion and the sons of the american revolution sar in september  berninghausen reported to the members on a case of censorship in peoria illinois involving films this episode  pitted librarian xenophon smith against the peoria american legion which protested the circulation of several united nations films including the award winning brotherhood of man on the grounds that they contained communist propaganda that was too subtle to be detected as such  pp   smith had the backing of many people in the community the education film library association the ifc and audio visual board chairman raynard c swank still he and the library board decided to restrict circulation to the library screening room  pp   according to berninghausen smith felt that the library bill of rights did not cover films berninghausen asked the members whether it should be revised to clarify that it covered all media  at a midwinter  joint meeting of the ifc and the audio visual board some three hundred attendees unanimously approved a footnote to the library bill of rights sending it on to the ala council where it was enthusiastically passed   the footnote extended the library bill of rights to all materials and media of communication used or collected by libraries  p  although the footnote embodied a consensus at the midwinter conference a second item labeling did not generate such unity the labeling question was first raised by ala executive secretary john mackenzie cory who forwarded to berninghausen inquiries from ulveling  and harold w tucker  director of the gary indiana public library each requested ala assistance in evaluating foreign language materials while the selection of these materials always posed problems in  they seemed more pressing a selector had to be cautious about what to include in open shelf collections since so many books published in the soviet bloc were believed to contain communist propaganda in  these ideas are labeled the censorship theory and the sponsorship theory in a quotation sent by rutherford rogers to david berninghausen during the height of the controversy  the quotation is found in  p 
segregating propaganda  some degree  ulveling asked ala to bring together people at the midwinter meeting to discuss the issue cory posed two problems to the ifc the desirability or undesirability and the methods by which some kinds of library materials may be labeled to clearly identify their origin and special point of view and the extent to which and the manner in which library materials may be restrained in use although not actually withdrawn from the collection these dilemmas cory remarked were closely related to the film censorship issue with which the ifc and the council had just dealt  the problem surfaced again in more dramatic fashion when the montclair new jersey sar called for labeling and restricted circulation of all communistic or subversive literature and for keeping a roster of those who used it  margery quigley librarian of the montclair public library wrote berninghausen by this time executive secretary of the ifc asking for advice in order that she and her library board should act in accordance with ifc recommendations  berninghausen forwarded the request to chairman rutherford rogers who suggested formulating a statement for the executive board to consider  meanwhile the montclair sar sent copies of their resolutions to all new jersey newspapers and to ala president clarence graham other new jersey libraries were experiencing similar challenges  the ifc arrived at a unanimous decision opposing labeling rogers however concerned that ifc members might be unusually sensitive to the subject of intellectual freedom and that they did not represent a cross section of types of libraries  p  sent questionnaires to a number of librarians asking their opinions on labeling inasmuch as this problem is growing in scope and in seriousness rogers said the ifc felt that once labeling is recommended it will be impossible to restrict it to communist literature alone this conclusion is supported by reports to ala that certain religious groups have demanded that libraries label material unfavorable to them  to present the ifc report to the council on july   rogers reviewed the sar proposal and quoted from many of the twenty survey responses   the fire of some critics  that berninghausen expected did not materialize and the council unanimously adopted the statement on labeling librarians should not use the technique of labeling as a means of predisposing readers against library materials the statement read and then enumerated six reasons why  although totalitarian states find it proper to establish criteria for judging materials to be subversive to  berninghausen opposed the questionnaire as appearing to put the ifc on the defensive when it had been working hard to establish its authority according to 
 the library quarterly do so is contrary to democracy and leads to injustice and ignorance rather than justice and enlightenment  the fact that a magazine or book is in a library does not indicate its endorsement by the library  people would be unlikely to agree on the material that should be labeled as subversive or the sources of information that should be regarded as suspect  labeling is an attempt to prejudice the reader and as such it is a censor tool  labeling violates the spirit of the library bill of rights  although librarians are opposed to communism and concerned about the threat it poses if materials are labeled to pacify one group there is no excuse for refusing to label any item in the library collection american librarians are opposed to any group which aims at closing any path to knowledge  p  as berninghausen had suspected however the council approval was not the end of the labeling issue shortly after rogers report was adopted ralph ulveling rose to raise some issues concerning book selection policies in this time of crisis   pp   his statement had apparently been formulated as a result of discussions earlier in  with the detroit public library commission  as associate director and since  director of the detroit public library ulveling had become known throughout the ala not only did he write a great deal more than sixty articles in his career but he was in demand as a speaker especially in the midwest through his writings and speeches ulveling shared his vision of the social role of the library that of leading individuals to higher and higher levels of educational attainment a liberal on civil rights issues he responded to the detroit race riots of  by publishing a brochure aimed at promoting understanding and tolerance he was highly regarded for his political acumen in  he used his political talents to prevent the detroit police department from removing lillian smith strange fruit from the library shelves on the other hand he felt that librarians had an obligation to guide readers in right thinking and he had strong opinions on cheap and shoddy books such as children series books which he confined to the reference collection he had served as president of ala in    ulveling began his address to the membership meeting with a brief preface on the menace of communism he then stressed the importance of the role of the librarian as book selector during an ideological war in which propaganda is second only to military strategy he said a failure of librarians to censor reading materials kept channels for enemy propaganda open thus he found the usual interpretation of the library bill of rights to be incompatible with his citizenship obligations ulveling called for educational statesmanship of a high order in the preparation of a suitable book selection policy
segregating propaganda  ulveling cited the detroit public library policies for the home reading and the reference research services materials for the former intended for the branches were intended to assist users in their best personal development not with the refinement or extension of knowledge and so were collected without regard to any obligations the total institution may have for preserving knowledge in its most comprehensive sense he said or for maintaining open avenues for the fullest exercise of intellectual freedom of inquiry  p  materials for the reference research services located in the main library were designed to provide all kinds of material even the socially economically religiously or politically unorthodox materials necessary for research for freedom of inquiry and for information of all types in practice ulveling said informational books on communism would be found in both while communist expressions of opinion or misleading propaganda would only be in reference where duplication of titles is limited in that way people with inquiring minds would have access to them but general readers would have placed before them only the books which have been chosen because of their importance in helping people to realize their best development and to carry out their obligations ably and well  p  coming as it did right after the adoption of the statement on labeling ulveling prescriptive and protective policy raised questions that could not be dealt with briefly ala president clarence graham referred them to the ifc with instructions to report no later than the  midwinter meeting the membership greeted with applause a request that the issue be discussed in the american library association bulletin alab  p  as ifc member marion hawes suggested to berninghausen later the detroit practice was not unusual in larger libraries which could not afford to put all titles in all the branches but which purchased single copies of some titles and kept them in large central collections at least some portion of which was relatively open the statement of the policy as ulveling had articulated it however hawes commented implied a more restrictive screening  in fact the practice was commonplace justified by finances or the need to provide professional guidance in the use of the more sensitive materials it was also a manifestation of the librarians awareness that book selection was at least in part a political process librarians who generally shared the dominant community values exercised constant vigilance in selecting books not only did public librarians as a group tend to segregate potentially controversial  joseph turow has discussed the differences in collection practices between branch and central collections in 
 the library quarterly materials in order to block access to them but they did so all the while insisting on the stereotypes of democratic freedom of expression and diversity of opinion  p  this contradiction grew out of librarians shifting understanding of who they were and their desire for professional autonomy as guardians of cultural values they defended their autonomy by keeping censorship of materials within their own jurisdiction since they assumed they knew what reading material contributed to the best personal development of their patrons as guardians of free access they defended their autonomy by defending their right to make available to their patrons all kinds of materials even those deemed subversive by some groups berninghausen wryly suggested that committee members make a new heading in your files i can predict with great assurance that this folder    will be a thick one by january   p  as new ala executive secretary david clift alab editor alice dunlap and ifc chairman rogers defined the assignment the ifc would prepare a paper commenting on each item raised by ulveling so members could prepare for midwinter discussion  p  the alab would not publish ulveling statement  nor would it publish any comment by ulveling on the ifc response to his speech dunlap added since to do so might give the impression that ulveling statement represented official ala policy  committee member frederic melcher publisher of library journal lj learned from the journal editor helen wessells that a large number of librarians seem to like mr ulveling program  ulveling told wessells that he was amazed at the many requests for his statement and at the number who had told him they were glad that at least somebody had come out with a workable policy statement which can be followed in practice by librarians and not just in theoretical discussions  wessells told ulveling that his statement would appear in full in the august lj predicting they both would be subject to brickbats she promised to go to bat in order to achieve some sound policy after years in which every purchase was dictated by the reaction of congress she said i know full well that a compromise has to be reached   leon carnovsky expressed this duality of attitude in  p  i have never met a public librarian who approved of censorship or one who failed to practice it in some measure  see  and  for a full discussion of the relationship between librarians struggle for professional autonomy and the development of the defense of freedom to read  i could not locate in the director file of the detroit public library archives any of the letters in support of his position to which he alluded in spite of an imaginative search of file names
segregating propaganda  berninghausen sent the text of ulveling speech to committee members and asked for their comments  pp   between august and november he repeatedly solicited opinions from the ifc council members and other correspondents and attempted to express the developing consensus the task was not simple earliest responses came from ala president elect robert b downs and the librarian of rice university william s dix downs cautioned that the problem could become controversial if we allowed our emotions to be involved saying that rogers report appealed to my heart and mr ulveling to my head he called the former an ideal and the latter a realistic   compromise  dix did not find ulveling statement so serious as it seemed to me at first the ifc could not prescribe to the individual librarian what his basis of selection is to be beyond the broad terms of the bill of rights he said ulveling stature as the director of a large city library and a former ala president meant his opinion would have great weight he must be answered very carefully but very calmly  the complacency of dix and downs bothered rogers if ulveling proposal had merely been a call for intelligent book selection as suggested ulveling had no reason to address the ala with his ideas  p  he faulted ulveling for putting librarians in the unenviable role of protecting the less intelligent and discriminating segment of the population by deciding what is ood and afe for them to read  ulveling proposal seems to me to be labeling he noted in a confidential postscript if so it is labeling of a most insidious character shall we say a ice way to label  p  marion hawes a librarian at the enoch pratt free library in baltimore sent her own and assistant director amy winslow comments both took exception to ulveling use of pratt collection development policy to support his position hawes agreed that ulveling position had implications as disturbing as do those for labeling  berninghausen second letter asked further assistance in order to try to capture a complete picture of the attitudes of the members of the committee he asked them to respond to several questions  did ulveling position conflict with the usual interpretation of the library bill of rights  was the library bill of rights incompatible with librarians responsibilities as american citizens  how would propaganda be defined who would decide what was propaganda  was ulveling position based upon the principle of protecting citizens by screening their reading if so is this a tenable position who should have access to controversial materials just the scholar or the general  for a picture of downs as a champion of intellectual freedom see 
 the library quarterly reader as well  was this the same question as the labeling question or not  thurston taylor who had recently withstood a challenge to library materials at the free public library of worcester massachusetts wrote that ulveling was as worried about allen zoll a right wing propagandist against the school systems as by communism  hawes agreed that one must label mentally before segregating library materials  although confused about the issue ralph ellsworth a former ifc member said he felt that we ought to encourage our profession to be against the kind of labeling that most librarians would do if they were encouraged to do so  hiller c wellman an ifc member and also a former ala president cautioned against making a mountain out of a molehill speaking heresy in an attempt to be practical rather than doctrinaire wellman asserted that while placing less desirable books in reference to diminish their use did constitute a degree of censorship the important point is that this censorship be sound and sensible and not swayed by outside pressure it might even allow a library to pursue a liberal policy by stilling public clamor  wayne shirley dean of the library school at pratt institute and not an ifc member shared wellman opinion and urged making no report  mabel conat a new ifc member who had recently retired after years at the detroit public library said ulveling position did not conflict with the library bill of rights since the detroit public library did present materials on all sides of controversial issues conat believed ulveling was trying to find a positive and practical way of handling propaganda material  when people are jittery and overly suspicious of public institutions his policy had enabled him to keep the support of city officials admitting that portions of ulveling statement smacked of censorship she attributed that to unfortunate wording  ulveling himself wrote to the ifc enclosing a letter to conat he stressed that he had not intended an attack on the library bill of rights lbr but rather had hoped it would be clarified then why did he stress the incompatibility of the lbr and his duties as a citizen berninghausen asked in the margin ulveling urged that only the policy paragraphs in his speech be examined in detail not those that were intended to give the reasons for writing it yes and he afraid to have this fringe examined too closely berninghausen jotted ulveling cited  the discussion of the importance of keeping censorship within the purview of the librarian was carried on in correspondence no one contributed an article with this thesis or even supported it in a letter to the editor of the three widely read journals alab lj or the wilson library bulletin
segregating propaganda  his fan mail as evidence that many librarians felt the library bill of rights needed clarifying or supplementing  ulveling letter had an unintended effect on the previously complacent dix who was shocked to realize that ulveling did believe in some form of labeling if ulveling had weakened to this extent the pressures to back up on censorship issues were stronger than dix had supposed since ulveling feelings would have considerable weight the ifc needed to be careful to keep the support of the ala membership we must somehow contrive to make it clear dix said that ulveling position is an untenable one without branding him officially as one who has violated our basic principles he did not believe the ifc would have any trouble defeating any amendment to the library bill of rights that ulveling might propose his confidence derived at least in part from a straw poll he had taken among a group of two hundred librarians attending a meeting at which he had spoken the previous saturday  a coherent report did not appear any easier than it had previously dunlap however urged the ifc to meet its moral obligation to publish a fairly detailed analysis of ulveling statement before the midwinter meeting she suggested that rogers and berninghausen write a statement as ifc members without speaking for the ifc excerpting comments both pro and con already received they could send this report to ifc members especially those who had not responded for additional remarks  berninghausen followed dunlap suggestion  dix approved of publishing the statement with modifications the ifc could not dodge the issue by failing to respond  conat opposed the report and took issue with the wording of a question the draft called fundamental is it the responsibility of the librarian to screen the materials placed before readers thus protecting them from the danger of exposure to ropaganda conat found the use of the word screen a smear where does creening start and ook selection stop she asked what is the purpose of librarians and why have book selection courses if they are not to screen and select from the products of the presses for their libraries  she sounded much like wellman who found that the whole controversy arose from trying to dodge the fact that some censorship by a librarian is inevitable and the whole question depends on how he exercises his censorship  by october  at least one other draft had reached the members lachlan macrae an ifc member who had previously been silent responded to both drafts by suggesting that the detroit public library position ran contrary to the library bill of rights and ulveling was trying to make the position more tenable by encouraging others to join
 the library quarterly it  hawes  and dix offered few editorial comments but enjoined against engaging in open debate with ulveling who appeared to be revising his thinking  dunlap advised that the report should refer to mr ulveling indirectly as much as possible  a newly appointed ifc member john e smith of the university of california los angeles library jumped squarely in the hawes taylorrogers berninghausen camp alluding to ulveling reference to the clear and present danger of communist propaganda smith said that the growing suspicion of unorthodox opinions the increasing number of censorship attempts and the punitive measures taken against those suspected of ever harboring dangerous thoughts presented a far greater menace he added and what is propaganda    whose statement that this or that idea is ubversive do we follow    where do we start and how do we stop if we embark on this thing  berninghausen had now achieved a measure of agreement and determined to meet the november  deadline a sheet in his handwriting identified six members and two others former member miriam matthews and editor dunlap as pro supportive of the draft statement two members as con and two as non voting  the next round of letters just days later referred to another revision the majority had approved the report but to make it acceptable to conat berninghausen had incorporated a number of her comments on the detroit policy he asked her to call him collect to discuss the revision  dix who succeeded rogers as ifc chairman found the latest draft definitely an improvement and voted to publish a continued program of indoctrination is one of the lines of activity clearly indicated for the committee he concluded  the article appeared in the november alab  berninghausen had woven together ifc members individual comments with excerpts from ulveling statement and transitional and summarizing statements following background information on ulveling speech melcher comments enunciated the ifc position that a program that protected general readers from contact with books that expressed any attitude other than direct antagonism toward communism was contrary to good library practice and untenable as a principle democracy depended he said on the availability of many points of view on which citizens could base their opinions the article asked whether it is the responsibility of the librarian to rotect branch library readers by rejecting books considered northodox and answered with an unqualified no  p  the segregation of materials the committee concluded was so closely akin to labeling that it must be ruled out as a solution to the problem of handling ropaganda  p  conat defense of ulveling that he had chosen his words unfortunately and that what
segregating propaganda  he was really talking about was not censorship but careful judicious book selectionwas included it was however clearly rejected by a majority of the committee  p  in the article final paragraph berninghausen reiterated the ala commitment to the library bill of rights and the statement on labeling and articulated firmly the stance of the ifc that librarians who live up to their professional responsibilities must oppose any practice or policy which attempts to rotect the ess intelligent or less discriminating citizenry by deciding what is ood or afe for them to read  p  the ifc report generated considerable response both negative and positive the diplomatic dix responded to one writer who applauded ulveling for speaking out on a most unpopular cause and found the ifc case that ulveling was compromising freedom unconvincing  the ifc had written a full statement on the ulveling paper dix said in hopes of generating open discussion and coming ultimately to as much unanimity of opinion as possible where there was apparent widespread difference of opinion since we seem to be in a period when the principles of freedom of expression are under rather serious fire  some expressed strong approval of what another writer called the ifc clear thinking on the interesting book selection policy of the detroit public library  both thurston taylor who had earlier sent his letter to berninghausen and paul bixler of antioch college who was to succeed berninghausen as secretary of the ifc wrote letters to li opposing ulveling policies   taylor bemoaned the present prevailing climate of opinion which could cause a librarian of ulveling sincerity and devotion to the best in american librarianship to propose such a booby trap  p  while bixler warned that the use of ulveling suggested policy would destroy small or medium sized libraries as institutions and would amount to imitating the censoring repressive tactics of the enemy  pp   at the midwinter meeting ulveling blasted the ifc report in an extended reply to the ifc committee  he recalled his defense in  of lillian smith strange fruit and his work in promoting civil rights not with prolific writing in journals but on the field of action he accused the ifc of using propaganda devices like putting quotation marks around prejudicial words not his own to distort his remarks  p  he referred to the ifc criticism of his apparent distinction between general readers and people with inquiring minds and concluded that the ifc probably didn understand me describing  berninghausen had put quotation marks around comments taken from the responses he had received from members of the ifc he had however failed to indicate that he was doing so
 the library quarterly the reference and branch collections he decried the ifc statement that placing a book in the reference services collection was labeling  p  trying to explain the nature of the ifc report he concluded that the ifc was so sure it was right it was willing to use unethical tactics he wished they had been sufficiently objective to realize that the library bill of rights is credo but that the implementation of that credo calls for sound hard constructive thought   by all of us the problem was not localized ulveling asserted the basic question of the handling of propaganda remained unanswered  pp   later in the day meeting attendees were stunned to discover that ulveling had taped both his speech and the subsequent discussion the steam generated during the morning one observer put it was as nothing compared with the response this news produced  in presenting to the council the midwinter  report of the ifc  pp   dix quoted ulveling statement referring to the incompatibility of the library bill of rights with his obligation as an american citizen to guard against propaganda he noted that some people had construed the ifc analysis of ulveling statement as a personal criticism of ulveling but that the ifc had not intended such he hailed ulveling long and distinguished record as a defender of freedom of ideas and voiced hope that the contention was past and that the ala could now turn its attention to a calm consideration of the principles involved  pp   dix acknowledged that any statement of general principles is subject to varying interpretations and that the ifc never presumed to institute a probe into any librarian interpretation of the library bill of rights but he insisted we must not let the fear of freedom divide us at a time when we most need unity we do believe that there is nothing in the library bill of rights that is incompatible with the best of the american heritage  p  in the discussion ulveling reiterated that the bill of rights is a theoretical policy statement and that we now have to move down to the next level to find some way of implementing this statement  p  dix announced the ifc plans to do just that through the continued airing of the basic issues at an institute on intellectual freedom to be held in connection with the upcoming annual conference in new york the institute would deal dix said with the whole basic philosophy of book selection which i am afraid goes back to even bigger questions of philosophy the whole philosophy of american librarianship  p  while sparring continued about the surreptitious tape recording  dix sent a conciliatory note to ulveling expressing gratitude for the opportunity to get together and talk  on the surface at least calm began to return hawes writing dix a few days after the meeting referred to the ulveling matter as having upset the schedule mem
segregating propaganda  bers of our own staff reported with some amusement seeing you at luncheon with mr ulveling in a very conspicuous position after a council meeting on friday she remarked and she joined the speculation as to whether this was a public demonstration of burying the hatchet  dix wrote the members in march that he hoped the whole ulveling affair is now fairly quiet and that we may get to work on a constructive program  p  he did protest however a report in lj that the ifc and ulveling had reached an accommodation of views reiterating that while the ifc had no intentions of being an inquisitorial body it still differed with ulveling  dix trusted the institute on intellectual freedom would help clarify the thinking of the profession on issues of book selection and handling raised by ulveling how may librarians implement conscientiously the abstract provisions of the library bill of rights dix put it and at the same time avoid becoming the tool of the communist conspiracy or of any other group which seeks to impose its own restrictive ideology upon the american people  the ulveling controversy revealed how far the ifc still had to go in resolving issues in book selection and censorship and in educating librarians to their role in upholding the library bill of rights in requesting permission from clift to spend grant funds for the institute dix wrote it should help clear the air still further on the whole ulveling matter  he wrote the ifc that the need for the institute had grown out of the chicago discussions  he hoped the institute attended by several hundred librarians might serve to ease some of the internal tensions produced by differences of opinion concerning the application of generally accepted principles it could not of course produce any dogma any authoritarian rules for the governance of all libraries  p  as if to point up the pertinence of the institute the library press in early  carried reports of a book burning in sapulpa oklahoma  and an attempted book labeling in burbank california  helen haines  edition of the classic living with books was attacked as communistic in the january   issue of the freeman  in congress the velde committee proposed the labeling of subversive books in the library of congress   a notice of the pending institute appeared in the may alab which expanded a brief lj mention  with a statement of the conference purpose to provide a forum for exploring the various concepts of intellectual freedom and its application in library practices  the program was structured around four sessions followed by discussion the planning committee had hoped to have ulveling himself among the speakers  but he did not appear in the final program
 the library quarterly  as surrogate the planners chose ralph munn director of the carnegie library pittsburgh who had endorsed ulveling position during the  midwinter meeting  munn discussed book selection in the large public library in the second session which dealt with the present problem in book selection he was joined by chief assistant librarian of congress verner clapp who spoke on the research library salina kansas public library director jerome cushman who spoke on the small public library and robert l collison reference librarian at the city of westminster library london who presented the british view each dealt with the handling of controversial materials especially propaganda  pp   clapp asserted that research libraries are based upon the premise of the right of free inquiry by the individual citizen and that attacks on that premise endanger the library the very fact that a book is controversial makes it important to purchase as the expert selected by the community to run its library the librarian would have to decide what principles are too vital to be compromised clapp suggested that free access to library materials was such a vital principle  pp   his small library cushman said treated all materials in the same manner none were segregated while he did not buy every book requested by patrons he secured those he did not through interlibrary loan he urged being conscious of the role of the library as a citadel of free communication  pp   collison called keeping objectionable books in a special place where they were available only on request a vile practice if a book was worth having it should be used segregating reduced its use and thus its value  p  munn expanded on the policy ulveling had articulated at the  annual conference librarians have a duty to eliminate disguised propaganda from the general collection doing so is justified he said on the grounds that such works are lacking in integrity that they are not what they purport to be  p  librarians make provision of books in a variety of ways from actively displaying them to putting them on restricted shelves from which they can be secured only by personal application to a librarian munn suggested that communist propaganda receive this treatment or be labeled  p  referring to the limited physical facilities of branch buildings which make it hard to segregate materials he said it was a long standing practice to eliminate certain items from their collections sex books novels not suitable for general circulation and expensive technical manuals received such treatment munn advocated that communist propaganda materials also be restricted to the central branch where they could be under the librarian watchful eye  p  the discussion that followed raised again the very issues encountered
segregating propaganda  in the debate with ulveling who would determine what is disguised propaganda how can librarians differentiate between legitimate criticism of the american system and genuine communist propaganda when pressure groups say that critical works on such topics as race relations or housing are following the communist line  p  the debate grew sharp when the discussion turned to the authority for book selection did librarians constantly have to defend their decisions not to purchase an item or could they stand on their professional expertise  pp   there was little resolution of these questions alan barth a newspaperman summarized the conference proceedings from a layman point of view  pp   to report on the institute to the ala council at the new york annual conference dix used portions of barth synthesis  pp   thereby distancing himself from any charges of personal bias for or against points of view expressed barth began by enunciating the substantial areas of consensus  pp   that freedom implies responsibility that libraries are an essential element in the system of free communication that freedom to read is a right of the public to know there was agreement that there is no such thing as wise censorship that book selection was imperative and that selection poses a challenge especially when professional librarians were in short supply finally they agreed that the american faith in freedom    is an asset to us in our endeavors to provide leadership in the free world then barth cut to the areas of disagreement munn statement that the library bill of rights must be interpreted with some regard for administrative feasibility and that the public library is a part of local government and cannot get too far from or go too far in advance of local public opinion had met with general approval  pp   when munn began to speak about how to handle communist propaganda however consensus disappeared his assertion that librarians should discover and eliminate disguised propaganda from libraries to segregate it and make it available to readers only under special conditions drew sharp dissent barth concluded that while munn represented a minority viewpoint there were no absolutes the problem had to be worked out    in terms of individual and conscientious judgments about particular books and perhaps no formula would serve    to solve the whole problem  p  dix report to the council was broadcast on the radio on july   and published in the august  lj   in a letter of thanks to milton lord of the boston public library for his evenhanded chairing of the controversial book selection session dix evaluated the institute while it did not settle all our problems it
 the library quarterly helped to establish an atmosphere of thoughtful discussion in terms of basic principles ala is surely large enough and mature enough professionally to permit honest differences of opinion  perhaps the ala as a whole did have the maturity to tolerate differences with which dix credited it some among ala leadership however were not willing to brook the ifc clash with an established librarian downs who became ala president in   considered berninghausen a young turk   he was almost too aggressively interested in intellectual freedom  in fact when the membership of the ifc was named for   ulveling appeared as a member berninghausen and his most recent recruit john e smith did not  there are several interesting new names dix wrote to bixler i suppose that dave term was really up but i hate to lose john smith i wish i had been consulted just a bit   bixler comment to smith was more colloquial they left you off the new committee dirty work at the crossroads  ulveling was not active as an ifc member he served in amicable relationship only one year of a two year term and then left because of the press of other work bixler wrote  to a librarian who complained about the ifc treatment of ulveling   apparently appointing ulveling to the ifc served the purpose of salving wounds and taming excess devotion to intellectual freedom and gave the ifc a way to answer the charge of cruelty to ralph ulveling it also presented at least the appearance of unity if not unanimity to the world at large and in  ala presented ulveling with the  lippincott award lauding him as a courageous defender of free access to all shades of opinion and types of information  the problem made apparent by the ulveling controversy the lack of consensus among librarians concerning their role in protecting the right of library users to freedom of inquirywas not solved by the first intellectual freedom institute the institute highlighted clearly the fine line between the professional act of book selection and librarians selfcensorship in the guise of book selection the relatively new role of librarians as activists in the cause of freedom of inquiry had only partially overtaken the role of librarians as preservers and uplifters of public taste and morals the process of moving librarians from supporters of truth to defenders of access a position clearly articulated by john swan in the freedom to lie a debate about democracy was hardly  lester asheim tackled the problem in the  intellectual freedom preconference    leon carnovsky dealt with it in a paper presented at the fourth annual library symposium at kent state university in may  and published the following year  the problem of self censorship to avoid difficulties was extensively documented among california school and public librarians a few years later in the famous fiske study
