accessibility and diversity in library and information science inclusive information architecture for library websites kyunghye yoon laura hulscher and rachel dols abstract we incorporate the perspective of diversity in order to discuss accessibility problems in lis diversity is defined as the ability to create and ensure inclusive information access and services for different user groups we outline the results of our study on library website accessibility for screen reader users based on our findings we argue that the inaccessibility of library websites is primarily a problem of diversity rather than being merely a technical issue the high level implications of this problem indicate the need to adopt inclusive principles that require usability beyond accessibility for all user groups in library web design to meet this goal we propose an inclusive information architecture specifically focused on screen reader access our intention is to present broader guidelines for information design by illustrating one way in which inclusive principles can be applied to library website design by expanding and customizing the information architecture to meet the individual needs of diverse user groups a ccess to information an important principle in library and information science is afundamental human right necessary for equal opportunity and full participation insociety however serving the information needs of a diverse public requires that libraries make efforts beyond simply distributing resources it also requires ensuring that those resources are actually usable by everyone web accessibility in particular has become crucial for libraries because of the increasing pervasiveness of internet technology in everyday life library websites are now a critical public access point to valuable information resources diversity has also been recognized in library and information science as a foundational principle that ensures intellectual freedom and equal access to information for all members of society in this sense there is a parallel between accessibility and diversity principles both of which stress inclusion and equal access to information to adhere to these principles libraries library quarterly information community policy vol  no  pp    by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
  the library quarterly must provide effective and functional access to information resources in order to meet the needs of the entire diverse range of individuals in the populations that they serve in this article we address accessibility as a diversity issue and propose the concept of inclusive information architecture as a means of promoting both accessibility and diversity as a case example of identifying an underserved groups needs for the purpose of extending information access based on theprinciple of inclusionwe investigated librarywebsites accessibility for persons with visual impairments we use this investigation as an example of identifying an underserved groups needs for the purpose of extending information access based on the principle of inclusion the study identified accessibility barriers common to library websites for this article we address accessibility barriers from a usability standpoint and we interpret inaccessibility as the result of a lack of inclusive principles in web design the purpose of this article is to provide an in depth discussion of the conceptual implications of meaningful accessibility that meets the needs of diverse individuals at a higher level than mere technical compliance with standards moreover this article aims to foster the inclusion of diverse user groups by expanding the concept of information architecture within the context of library websites in the following sections we begin with a literature review and a brief description of our study and its findings followed by a discussion of their conceptual implications the discussion addresses how diversity issues contributing to inaccessible library websites might be remedied by incorporating inclusive principles the inclusive information architecture proposed as a possible remedy is specifically illustrated and applied for visually impaired users as an example background concepts and related literature diversity as the us population has become more diverse historical concepts of diversity shaped by early civil rights movements have broadened from very general raceand gender based categories to include a wider range of marginalized groups paul t jaeger and colleagues  propose that for the lis profession diversity must include all groups that are underrepresented disadvantaged or underserved in terms of information  there is also a growing awareness of the fact that structural disadvantages for marginalized groups are created through cultural practices of exclusion if this is the case then achieving diversity requires not only fair laws rules and regulations but also cultural social and professional competencies that seek to limit exclusion lazar and jaeger  in this sense we view diversity as a professional competency and adopt raquel j gabriels definition of diversity as the ability of relating to reflecting and adapting to different groups emphasizing the cultural and social aspect that includes more points of view   professional devotion to diversity and equal access is reflected in a number of major american library association documents including the library bill of rights which declares that the library serves all members of the community ala  and the intellectual freedom
accessibility and diversity in library and information science   statement libraries an american value ala  the ala also directs libraries to go beyond the goal of equal access by pursuing equity in other words to commit resources in order to level the playing field for disadvantaged groups kranich  this is an important basis for our claim that librarians should consider expanding information architecture to include an additional layer for screen reader users on library websites web accessibility legislation guidelines and standards a great deal of the lis literature on accessibility stresses its legal aspectsfor example the implications for libraries of title ii of the americans with disabilities act  section  of the rehabilitation act of  and various state laws vandenbark  fulton  lazar and hochheiser  the literature also demonstrates that in spite of legislative imperatives most library websites are not truly accessible for people with disabilities lazar and jaeger  southwell and slater  comeaux and schmetzke  jaeger bertot and subramaniam  argue that improvements are especially crucial because technology itself can be responsible for constructing disability another challenge lies in the ambiguity of technical guidelines for web accessibility and the lack of specific directives in applying them following the web accessibility initiatives web content accessibility guidelines wcag wc   many resources provide recommendations and best practices for accessible web design thatcher et al  riley huff  horton and quesnebery  however a number of studies assert that guidelines such as wcag  though broad in scope are difficult for developers to interpret donnelly and magennis  brophy and craven  vandenbark  and apply at the design stage fogli provenza and bernareggi   dagfinn rømen and dag svanæs  also affirm that there is little to no correspondence between the priority levels of wcag criteria and the actual severity of problems faced by real web users with disabilities the issue is compounded by the fact that standards and guidelines become quickly out of date in the context of rapidly changing technology for example the guideline stating that all content must be accessible via keyboard is not clearly applicable to mobile devices with virtual keyboards or no keyboard at all abou zahra brewer and henry  a frequent approach to web accessibility is to have developers adjust the code to comply with guidelines after a site has been designed this approach typically results in a product that is technically accessible but not usable for people with disabilities because their actual needs are not considered in the design process lazar and jaeger  fogli provenza and bernareggi  however there are currently no guidelines to assist web developers in approaching website accessibility as a design problem as opposed to a technical compliance issue usability beyond accessibility and universal design studies have shown that compliance with technical accessibility guidelines does not guarantee meaningful information access or usability for people with disabilities rømen and svanæs
  the library quarterly  hill  barbara leporini and fabio paterno  describe usability and accessibility as two intertwined aspects of the same thing brian kelly and colleagues  contend that prioritizing standards compliance over the context of usability may in fact limit accessibility jakob nielsen  urges developers to adopt a usability perspective when testing accessibility which involves real users in conjunction with automated testing tools universal design is a principle that prioritizes equality by designing all products    to be usable by all people mace hardie and place  cited in bjork   in terms of information resources universal design aims to provide a barrier free environment that allows all users to navigate and access information by means of a user centered information architecture information architecture is a design process and outcome resulting in the structural design of an information space that supports the usability and findability retrievability of information morville and rosenfeld  by providing the proper combination of organization labeling searching and navigation schemes information architecture enables designers to create an information space that adheres to the principles of universal design universal design should not however be confused with the one size fits all approach when an interface design is focused on a specific user group it may not satisfy other users needs for example integrating images and graphics as a text supplement is a common priority when designing websites to meet the needs of people with certain cognitive and learning disabilities friedman and bryen   but an ideal website for users with visual impairments prioritizes text based information over visual content following the idea of flexibility of approach delivery and application that allows universal design to be accessible to diverse audiences zeff   information architecture must emphasize the varying abilities and constraints of individuals in a diverse user population rather than seek a uniform solution winance  to this end we suggest an inclusive information architecture with multiple layers of interfaces that encompass the unique needs of different user groups through alternative information architectures but at the same time allow all groups to access the same underlying website services and content studies on users with visual impairments it is estimated that  million people in the united states have visual impairments cornell university  library websites are an especially important resource for members of this group because of their increased demand for access to materials such as braille books audiobooks transcripts of image based texts and search tools phillips  southwell and slater  however web users with visual impairments often fell far short of what active participation in society requires when it comes to being able to interact with websites van der geest   web design principles developed to make the most of the graphical user interface gui privilege users who perceive information visually leuthold bargas avila and opwis  studies investigating the information processing behaviors of persons with visual impairments

  the library quarterly opportunity to explore the specific web use and browsing needs of people with visual impairments in the study a usability accessibility test was conducted with six blind participants who were asked to navigate three different library websites two academic and one public and two nonlibrary websites while the researchers observed their navigation patterns through thinkaloud protocols participants used their own laptops and screen readers their level of experience with screen reader technology ranged between  and  years each data gathering session consisted of a preinterview the actual testing of the website and an exit interview the preinterview explored participants everyday web use with questions about frequently used websites and some of the challenges they experience as screenreader users the testing portion consisted of an open ended exploration of the home page followed by two to three basic predetermined task scenarios for each of the four sites the task scenarios for the library websites included catalog searching making a research help appointment in an academic library and signing up for a public library e book workshop the nonlibrary website tasks included searching for an information item placing an order and finding directions to the physical location of a business the testing employed researchers intervention and redirection when accessibility barriers prevented tasks from being carried out this was done in order to get data on as many aspects of the websites accessibility as possible the exit interview was conducted to gain participants retrospective thoughts on what had happened what had been their expectations and what had made the tasks difficult or easy findings our test results were consistent with other studies conclusions that most library websites are not truly accessible oud  southwell and slater  in fact even with frequent intervention by the researchers no single participant was able to complete all of the library website tasks successfully normally usability criteria ask how easily participants are able to complete a task or how many tasks are completed easily yet our study revealed that visually impaired users are not able to navigate or explore typical library websites independently the question for our study therefore became how many tasks the participants were able to complete with some intervention in our study about half of the library tasks were completed successfully among the successfully completed tasks only half were completed without intervention from facilitators a task scenario that required finding an item from a library catalog was completed by only  five is the widely accepted number of participants required for usability testing nielsen  as the research purpose is to uncover usability problems with the design rather than to understand the user population the participant group consisted of two women and four men between the ages of  and  three were postgraduate students or professionals and one was a college undergraduate student
accessibility and diversity in library and information science   one participant without intervention taking  minutes another task that required finding a subject resource was completed only once without intervention taking  minutes finally a task that involved signing up for a workshop was completed by two participants in a relatively short amount of time without intervention but was extremely difficult for all other participants overall the library websites were more difficult than the nonlibrary websites for participants to navigate even with assistance for example even with effort very few participants had success finding the library catalog search interface on their own the most common barrier to task completion on the library websites was difficulty with navigation this problem was most often inherent to the websites information architecture rather than technical barriers participants were often unable to locate themselves within a sites structure ie determining which page they were on or which process they were involved in in some cases basic orienting information was not properly available examples included the fact that a home button was not shown on the catalog page which caused users to rely on back buttons or to try editing the page url or the fact that the full name of a university was not available as text only the acronym was used in the alternate text for the image although it was visible to sighted users via a subtitle on the logo image library sites often provide multiple entry points for searching items for example databases journals nonfiction and new collections this is not inherently bad design but it may confuse screen reader users because they dont have the benefit of visual cues and are more attuned to semantics just finding a library catalog was not an easy task for the study participants because of multiple points to access scattered among other busy content in other cases the volume and variety of information on each page also contributed to this problem when participants tried to read pages containing a large amount of text or diverse types of information they were often unable to make sense of the pages context especially if the information was not coded in a hierarchical structure that allowed them to get an overview of the page or skip to the desired content or if the pages relied too heavily on visual cues for navigational context our observations of participants revealed that they were not frequent library website users despite their desire and need to access and use information on the web which was consistent with other study findings lewis  most participants used the internet regularly for purposes such as e mail communication social networking on sites such as facebook and twitter shopping job searches music and reading many also indicated that they prefer to use familiar sites as much as possible rather than face the learning curve of new sites overall the library websites in our study seemed extremely difficult for participants to navigate and use  the assessment that library web pages contain excessive information for the purposes of a screen reader interface was based on respondents frequent comments that the sites were too busy indicating that the number of links menu options or different elements on the page was too great to process at one time
  the library quarterly unless assistance was provided without an adequate understanding of the library site structures or a sense of the value of the library resources to them many participants expressed that they would not have the motivation to commit on their own to the steep learning curve necessary for blind web users this shows considerable inequity in meeting the needs of this particular user group and calls for attention to the conceptual implications of the problem for the broader lis field in this article we will argue that technical validation with accessibility guidelines and evaluation tools does not necessarily provide a conceptual framework that can guide accessible web design for screen reader users at a high level without high level accessibility users may be discouraged from using unfamiliar or complex websites that they might otherwise find useful this is especially true for library sites whose complexity and tendency to include a high volume of information on each page is difficult for screen readers to manage and poses a significant barrier for users who depend on the linear transmission of written text into audio even when technical compliance with accessibility standards was met usability issues remained a steep barrier for study participants which confirms the assertion by christopher power and colleagues  that for mutually shared usability problems people using screen readers experience barriers of significantly higher severity than people who are able to browse visually their study on the relationship between accessibility standards and usability barriers for screen reader users concludes that usability must be adopted as a success criterion if web accessibility standards are to be effective in meeting the information needs of real people our study results therefore suggest that screen reader users are effectively excluded from the target audience for library services in the sense that their needs are not considered in the design of those services we interpret this inaccessibility of library websites to be a fundamental diversity issue in other words users with visual impairments are not included in the working definition of users by website design criteria discussion of proposed information architecture with inclusive principles given this interpretation this article will focus on providing a high level recommendation for library web design our intention is to address the fundamental issues of equal accessibility as a diversity issue and not just a technical one we propose the principle of inclusive information architecture as a conceptual framework that incorporates inclusiveness principles to guide website design from the very beginning of the process in contrast to conventional accessibility testing which is usually done after the site is completed the proposed information architecture considers the individual contexts of diverse groups by expanding the notion of universal design to include multiple modes of presenting the same content in order to meaningfully support their unique needs the inclusive information architecture suggested is multilayered with each layer employing a user centered design to cater to different user groups with different disabilities or other
accessibility and diversity in library and information science   unique contexts of use we focus specifically on the design of one layer which is based on the understanding gained through our study of the nature of visually impaired users information processing through screen readers in this section we describe how the proposed inclusive information architecture will be screen reader friendly and will reduce the accessibility barriers that we found in our study with the following four guiding principles  screen readers assume that information is presented linearly  screen reader users process information aurally  in aural processing cognition is limited by the amount of information  screen reader users have the same information needs as any other users screen readers assume that information is presented linearly support linearization of information with hierarchical structure the inclusive information architecture proposed in this discussion assumes that users with visual impairments are the main target audience in order to prioritize and address their specific needs information seeking strategies and interests this group relies on screen readers and uses the keyboard exclusively instead of the typical mouse keyboard combination preferred by sighted users screen reader users do not have a critical advantage that sighted users have the ability to glance across the entire page at once and know which area contains the desired information therefore screen reader friendly information architecture should enhance usability for the linear presentation of information so that users can navigate websites according to their own unique strategies for browsing searching and locating information when linearized it should be based on text oriented content with a well embedded hierarchical structure and should not rely on visual cues effective linearization of information is fully enhanced by a clear hierarchical navigation system and a careful reorganization of information that is appropriate and available for screen readers with linear content presentation it is essential to provide top level navigation so that users can effectively skip to the information they want and bypass unnecessary sections the hierarchical structure should allow the content to be logically divided into broad categories first and then further divided into subcategories as needed the architecture that supports linearization can be viewed as analogous to the idea of responsive web design mobile sites are an effort to rearrange the desktop sites information in a way that is compatible with small narrow screens in mobile web design the small screen size means that the most effective architecture for user experiences involves removing multicolumn layouts and turning them into single column layouts among other adaptations incidentally users with visual impairments often seem to rely on the mobile version of a website if available because mobile sites tend to be more accessible in general wentz and lazar  this is most
  the library quarterly likely because the single column design common in mobile sites forces web developers to linearize the sites content into a logical order and provide a clear set of navigational headings that can be understood without extra text or visual cues screen reader users process information aurally information is available only through text reading prioritize information content that can be read as textonly and is suitable for aural processing rather than visual with effort hierarchical navigation can and should be implemented reasonably well even within a visually oriented website however a screen reader friendly information architecture would differ in prioritizing and calling attention to information and resources that are actually available and accessible via screen readers the catalog for example should allow for searches of collections that would be of interest to visually impaired users by virtue of being in a readable and accessible format such as audiobooks e books braille books and other machinereadable content given that one of the most important features of a library website is catalog searching the search interface should be augmented with additional filters to help users find these items in our study library catalogs presented multiple barriers for screen reader users simply locating the search interface for materials was almost always a struggle on the public library website searching was not an easy task for most participants because filters were not easily perceivable in a linearized environment another source of difficulty was that the catalog searches often brought up long lists of results that were difficult for the participants to scan results should be presented manageably for the screen reader users browsing for example titles should be formatted as links or headings to facilitate skipping from title to title the presentation of catalog search results is one of the areas in which improved navigational hierarchy is needed for screen reader users to bypass unwanted items and to go directly to the desired one a brief tutorial of how to use the catalogs basic and advanced search tools would be a useful feature in the inclusive architecture as many of the advanced search tools on the test websites proved difficult for the study participants to use difficulties with search interfaces can be attributed not only to poor linearization but also to a lack of familiarity with library catalog searching some websites create tutorials specifically for screen readers and these tutorials are invisible to anyone who does not access the site with a screen reader in the case of libraries though a basic tutorial on advanced searching would be equally beneficial for many sighted users who are less familiar with catalog searching so it might be helpful to make the tutorial available to everyone however the tutorial in this layer can be further tailored for the screen reader users characteristics of information searching for screen reader friendly information architecture it is also important to provide a meaningful description for those who rely on textual description for the missing content provided by
accessibility and diversity in library and information science   visual cues and context the screen reader friendly architecture must include these strategies which depend on a thorough implementation of web accessibility best practices when library websites contained links requiring visual placement or contextual cues to be fully understood the text only presentation of such links confused the participants we observed that such confusion often resulted in rabbit holes from which the participant could not escape because the appropriateness of a link could not be evaluated through the destination page without the visual context another consideration to be taken into account is that users with visual impairments are generally more interested in getting direct access to information content and less in taking time to listen to summaries of decorative elements or background images that do not contribute to the substance of the information on the page therefore we suggest separating decorative images from content images providing meaningful alternative text for content images and blank alternative text  for decorative images which is recommended by the wcag links browsing is most effective when the site follows the guidelines for accessible link labeling many screen reader users rely heavily on links lists for navigation which means that they do not always have the context of the rest of the paragraph to help them make sense of a links text for that reason it is important to make sure that the link text is descriptive enough to be understood out of context without being overly wordy links browsing is also facilitated when redundant links are removed and the number of links is lessened in aural processing cognition is limited by the amount of information help reduce cognitive overload to improve information processing an accessibility barrier found numerous times in our study was the presence of too much information the participants often complained that library sites were too busy especially when on library home pages indicating that there was too much information to process efficiently many of the issues stemming from this problem can be resolved not only by a hierarchical structure for top down navigation but also by eliminating redundant points of access to the same content multiple access points can be useful for visual browsing but almost always seem to hinder screen reader users many library websites appear to use the home page to appeal to every possible user and use of the librarys web resources this practice results in an unmanageable volume of text for screen reader users to parse and also creates the additional barrier of too many links as screenreader users often browse links lists for more efficient access an excessive number of links particularly when redundant andor not clearly labeled substantially increases the time needed to browse websites and places a large burden on a users short term memory we suggest minimizing the amount of redundant content so as to reduce the cognitive load on users by cutting out repetitive occurrences of content and paring down the volume of information on the home page screen reader friendly architecture will also avoid accessibility bar
  the library quarterly riers generated by dynamic web elements such as tab panels and drop down menus in the navigation bar we use the term dynamic to mean any web element that shows or hides content based on a users action typically mouse hovering and clicks such elements can be difficult or even impossible to use for people who rely on a keyboard instead of a mouse many of the websites in our study contained dynamic elements in order to save visual space especially on the home page which as discussed earlier already had a great deal of content for sighted users drop down menus are an appealing design factor because they make the page appear less cluttered but for screen reader users they are not only hard to interpret but are often difficult or even impossible to use as intended without the help of a mouse although the web accessibility initiatives accessible rich internet applications wc  provides ways to describe dynamic and interactive elements in coding many dynamic elements are used mainly to enhance visual appeal and are often unnecessary in screen readerfriendly information architecture the clutter will have already been reduced if the home page is organized with a hierarchical navigation menu and if the content is pared down to remove excessive or repetitive occurrences of information if the page contents are streamlined and excess information is reduced then there is no need for dynamic elements whose purpose is to save space and reduce the appearance of clutter cognitive load can also be reduced by reorganizing information so that the content is linearized in a logical sequence even if a page is hierarchical we observed that it does not linearize logically which can limit the users ability to find what they need one specific example of a problem that the study participants encountered was a search button that was located directly above the associated search filter menus a sighted user would have no trouble associating the filters with the search button because of their visual proximity but one of the participants had difficulty because of the order of linearization the search button being on top was the first thing that the screen reader read which means that the participant heard the presence of the button and stopped reading because he thought he had found everything he needed an improved design would place the search button after the last filter so that the button would be read after all of the filtering options tailoring the layout and contents of the page to reduce the cognitive load in some ways parallels current practices in web design meant to attract audiences of different cultural groups to enhance usability for different cultural audiences and to target each particular local group mccool  screen reader users have the same information needs as any other type of users create an additional but not separate architecture it is important to note that the proposed architecture is not intended to be a separate website but should be additionally available according to users requests it is often the case that when
accessibility and diversity in library and information science   a website maintains a completely separate accessible version that version is not updated as frequently as the standard one with a resulting disparity in information access between disabled and nondisabled users hazard  wentz and lazar  in our proposed architecture a screen reader user would have the option to select a link and go to the screen reader page if desired but could also stay on the main page instead screen reader accessible architecture can be added as a skip to link in the html at the top of the main sites navigation and the link can be styled to be hidden from sighted users view while still being available to screen readers similarly skip to links can be employed in other major navigational aids for example a skip to results link can be added to the catalog searches thus saving time and making search interfaces more usable adding inclusive information architecture for screen readers would allow the existing visually oriented information architecture to fully leverage current trends in the visual and dynamic features that help sighted users optimally organize information such techniques can actually enhance communication and support for users with disabilities such as dyslexia or other cognitivemental disabilities friedman and bryen  by creating an inclusive information architecture for screen reader users developers would be able to address the needs of multiple disability groups one architecture would provide visuals to assist users with learning disabilities and cognitive impairments and the other would provide screen reader users with the linear focused text based content that best meets their needs the information architecture for linearized content should be considered not as an add on but as a built in part of the initial website design populated with the same content as visually oriented architecture allowing screen reader users to interact with it in the same way as sighted users if a library already has a mobile version of its website the mobile site may be a good starting point to augment for the screen reader friendly architecture because it is already linearized in a meaningful way quite a few other features of mobile specific architecture are also optimal for screen reader users such as the fact that mobile sites have fewer redundant repetitions of links and content than desktop sites and the content relies on hierarchical navigation and linear order rather than on visual context to make sense conclusion through our accessibility study we discovered some of the barriers impeding the usability of library websites for users with visual impairments who rely on screen readers and we propose a practical design solution to make library websites more usable and accessible for screenreader users by employing inclusive principles of universal design these principles could be applied to the design of library services to meet the needs of any underserved group the lis profession has always been committed to equal information access for all and it is time for librarians to prove their relevance by showing that the profession is prepared to serve an in
