john m wing foundation  and the americas but it also contains a few printed pieces from the orient it collects manuscripts and printed books on the subjects encompassed by this brief definition and contains several artifacts such as composer sticks and type molds as well in examining the purpose and scope of the wing foundation it is illuminating to begin with the life of john m wing whose vocation was printing and publishing and whose interest in books forms the background to his testament the establishment of a library within a library  p  devoted to the printing arts life and legacy of john m wing   john mansir wing was born in ferndale oswego county new york on april   he was the son of a blacksmith and farmer a descendant of the reverend john wing whose widow and four sons had come from england in  to settle in new england he attended school in pulaski new york left home at the age of twelve  and became a printer devil in pulaski several months later he was employed as a typesetter and utility man for the roman citizen in rome new york here he was eventually permitted to write editorials and earned something of a reputation by composing his editorials directly into type then employed by the utica herald in utica new york for two years during the civil war he worked first as a proofreader and later as an editorial writer and compiler of news concerning new york state wing failed in an attempt to establish his own newspaper in waukegan illinois and an advertising agency in st louis missouri during the closing years of the civil war he arrived in chicago in august  at the age of twenty one and immediately became a reporter for the chicago times he continued in this position until  during this period he also ventured into book publishing he wrote and published such books of local interest as the great union stock yards of chiago   the biographical information in this section is drawn largely from john mansir wing  an article written shortly after wing death  the genealogical material refers to  as the date of birth an introductory note to a great wing library  p  refers to  as the date of birth as does all secondary material published after this date  the genealogy of wing can be traced in the owl           and         and      and    and  further information is in a historical and genealogical register of john wing of sandwich mass and his descendants and his descendants   
 the library quarterly the great chicago lake tunnel  and history of the great chicago lake tunnel  in  wing became a traveling correspondent in europe for the boston herald and expected to become managing editor of this newspaper after his return but when the owner died in  he was disappointed in his hope of being given the position when wing returned to chicago in  he established j m wing and company publishers which published the land owner   a monthly devoted to real estate land grants buildings and city improvement when the great fire of  destroyed his office and equipment he took the next train to new york and returned with new type in the years following the fire the land owner contained information on the rebuilding of chicago and satisfied its readers curiosity with pictures and information about important new buildings the land owner was heavily illustrated and full of advertisements at ten cents per copy it was the sort of enterprisein a booming chicago which would make wing a wealthy man other publications related to the city of chicago the architecture of chicago or the chicago fire and rebuilding were published by j m wing and company most of these apparendy were written by wing himself for example wing illustrated travelers and visitors hand book to the city of chicago  and the tunnels and water system of chicago  even though it was a great success wing began to lose interest in the land owner and turned his attention to another publication that he expected would appeal to a wide readership in chicago the western brewer and journal of the barley malt and hop trades   it was issued monthly reporting on crops and brewery production like the land owner it was filled with advertisements and was highly profitable in connection with the western brewer there was also an annual publication wing brewersand book of the united states and canada   wing retired in  at the age of forty three he traveled extensively and wherever he went visited bookstores he began to accumulate a large library during his retirement years   most of his resources were devoted to book related pursuits by  wing had gathered a collection of about  volumes  p  consisting largely of history biography travel and literature he called his collection the old corner library the name derived from his house in chicago in which he lived with his sister and elderly parents the old corner library occupied three rooms of this house years later in describing his collection wing commented having been bred a printer i naturally turned to collecting early examples of the rt preservative of arts   p  he mentioned that he had collected specimens of the work of aldus manutius the elzeviers plantin and the celebrated press at basel switzerland where the works of erasmus were printed  p 
john m wing foundation  he was also an energetic and enthusiastic extra illustrator of books this practice had been popularized by james granger who beginning in  added engraved portraits and other illustrative material to the original contents of a book although bibliophiles today condemn this practice an examination of the products of wing extra illustrating efforts demonstrates the skill with which the work was done wing busied himself with this activity to the extent that octavo and quarto volumes were often made into folios or one original volume might be made into several volumes he selected the illustrative material removed it from books and magazines and interleaved the illustrations with the text of his selected book adding an explanatory title page others bound these newly created books by the time of his death wing had extra illustrated several hundred volumes in addition to collecting and extra illustrating books he also collected prints and book plates he was especially enamored of early engravings finally wing was interested in his family history to this end he wrote family trees and genealogy of the wing family of america  and was instrumental in organizing wing family of america which published the owl a genealogy magazine of the wing family these book related pursuits of john m wing form the background for understanding his contribution to the newberry library he wrote in  i have given my books by will to the great newberry library of chicago for the benefit of the people of this city of which it is to form a distinct section to be known as the ohn m wing foundation of the newberry library  p  how long before this article or the formal will did wing think along these lines when did the will first exist as a formal document did anyone either the librarian or one of the trustees assist wing in formulating the ideas expressed in the will there is minimal documentary evidence by which these questions concerning his relationship to the newberry library between  and  can be answered however we do know his thinking in  and it will be useful to summarize his ideas as outlined in a great wing library   the collection of books including the extraillustrated books were to be given to the newberry library  this collection would be known as the john m wing foundation of the newberry library  there would be an endowment whose income would be used to augment the collection  the collection would be maintained separate from other books as a library within a library  the paintings of his parents and of himself would be hung on the walls at a time not recorded in the available documents the library pro these interests are reflected in the old corner library scrap book about books bibliography book plates libraries and other things picked up here and there by a philosopher 
 the library quarterly vided space where wing pursued his interest in books beyond the indications of his intentions in  nothing is known about this period except that john m wing was favorably disposed toward the newberry library in a letter of may   from bryan lathrop secretary of the library to wing lathrop acknowledges receipt of wing letter of february  concerning the disposition of his books lathrop comments briefly the matter was referred to the committee on investments and finance in a further letter of january   lathrop informs wing that the questions connected with the establishment of the john m wing foundation were referred to horace h martin representing the book committee and himself representing the finance committee as a result of this letter and further conversation wing met with martin onjanuary   a letter of january   from wing to lathrop is most important because he withdraws his request for setting aside the fourth floor of the building for the wing foundation but states clearly i decline to change my will and insert therein a clause for request allowing the books to be scattered throughout the entire library thus annulling the very basic idea of the foundation a few months later in a letter of april   from harry pratt judson of the university of chicago to wing judson outlines a plan whereby  there would be a memorial room at the university of chicago for the collection of books and prints accumulated by wing and  income from the endowment would be used to develop the john m wing collection of european history wing responds immediately to judson on april   that he has decided to put off the matter until later he writes later on when my domestic affairs and my disturbed condition of mind has reached a more settled basis i shall take the liberty of requesting another interview with you wing mention of domestic affairs apparently refers to making some provision for his niece susan gilbert in a letter of april   judson acknowledged receipt of wing letter of april   no draft of a will dated earlier than  is available and inasmuch as this draft contains no additional date it is not certain whether the draft was prepared before or after the above mentioned exchange of letters this earliest extant draft of the last will and testament of john m wing  contains as its ninth provision should the newberry library decline to accept this bequest and carry out its provision and  the letters and memoranda cited in this and subsequent paragraphs are in the files of the business office of the newberry library along with copies of various legal and financial documents pertinent to the wing foundation
john m wing foundation  should so notify my executor in writing i then in that event and then only give devise and bequeath my entire residuary estate as mentioned in paragraph five to niversity of chicago substituting the name of the university of chicago in place of he newberry library wherever the latter appears written in this my will   this provision is eliminated from the final draft in   from the letters and meetings described above it is clear that wing maintained these ideas he set forth in  particularly the one that the john m wing foundation would be a library within a library in the letter of january   from wing to lathrop cited above wing rejected the idea of scattering his books throughout the library an idea conveyed orally to him by horace h martin it appears that by september  the trustees agreed with wing since action was taken to deposit wing collection of books and prints in the room designated for them some years ago  p  wing moved his collection to the third floor of the library and worked among his books during   his library was available for use by readers although wing himself owned and maintained control of the collection before the last will and testament of john m wing  was revised in  another document had been prepared in   it appears never to have been signed there is no substantive difference between this document and the last will and testament of john m wing  the final draft of the will dated march   contains as its most important provisions sections   and  the sixth provision  is concerned mostly with the physical arrangements and administrative aspects of the john m wing foundation it can be summarized as follows  the collection of books and prints known as the old corner library will be the nucleus of the wing foundation  the collection is to be augmented with income from the capital of his estate  the room in which the library was already placed following the trustees decision in september  is to be known as the memorial room of the john m wing foundation  various oil portraits are to be hung in the memorial room  the collection of extra illustrated books is to be kept in glass front dust proof cases  the library shall employ at the expense of the estate a custodian who shall be responsible for the care and cataloging of the books  the books purchased with income from the estate shall be placed in an area adjacent to the memorial room this last provision was not in the  draft but was in the  agreement  in comparing these terms with the ideas set forth in a great wing library one concludes that the two documents are consistent and that the final draft of the will of  is more specific the seventh and eighth provisions deal with matters not set forth in
 the library quarterly  or mentioned in the letters exchanged between wing and lathrop in  and  these two provisions were probably developed by or at least with the stimulus of horace h martin a trustee of the newberry library from  to  and vice president of the trustees from  to  he was also a member of the book committee from  to  and its chairman from  to   the exact circumstances leading to the preparation of wing will are not known through primary documents but it is reasonable to conjecture that martin assisted wing in the preparation of the will in  pierce butler wrote it so happened that horace h martin   had long cherished the idea of a purely typographical collection  p  butler also observed that martin developed a scheme for a typographical library and the wing foundation thus owes its establishment and organization very largely to his interest  p  since w n c carleton the newberry librarian from  to  was interested in the history of printing and bibliography it is possible that he also influenced wing decisions about the terms of the will the seventh provision of the final draft outlines the categories of materials to be purchased with the income from the estate books are to be purchased which treat of relate to illustrate exemplify or depict either wholly or in part either directly or indirectly the following subjects viz  the history and development of the arts of printing engraving and book illustration from the date of the introduction into europe of the art of printing with movable metal type  bibliographyby which term i mean the science history record and description of printed books  in explanation of these stipulations the will declares that the collection should contain representative and typical specimens of the work of all the typographically or historically important printers and presses of europe and north america so that the typographer historian and bibliographer may be enabled to trace at first hand from original materials every significant development of the arts of printing and book production the contents and subject matter of these books should always as far as possible have a literary biographical historical or artistic interest or importance as well as typographical j the eighth provision deals with further administrative aspects of the wing foundation and can be summarized as follows  except for the cost of binding books and the salary of the custodian the income of the wing estate shall be used for the purchase of books as described in the seventh provision the administrative overhead is to be paid by the library  a book plate reading the john m wing foundation of the newberry library shall be placed in each book in the collection but the book plate of the old corner library shall not be removed  the income of the estate shall be spent annually unless the book market
john m wing foundation  would be unreasonably high in a given year however if unexpended revenue should amount to  it shall be added to the capital  the library shall have full authority to invest and reinvest the principal of the estate as it seems advisable  the library shall maintain a separate account for the wing foundation the terms of the will are clear the collection of books accumulated by wing would be the nucleus of the john m wing foundation the income from his endowment would be used to purchase and bind books that exemplify the development of printing and related arts along with the subject of bibliography there would be a custodian responsible for the collection whose salary would also be paid from the income but all other expenses would be paid by the library and the terms pertaining to physical arrangements would maintain the wing foundation as a library within a library wing disposed of the house in which he lived with his parents and sister and during the later years of his life he lived in hotels during these transient years he visited and worked in the midst of his collection as often as he could he died of pneumonia on march   early decisions of the trustees  and  the library was formally notified of wing testament will in   p  and the first custodian was appointed in january   p  it appears that the initial response to the formal notification of the terms of the will was made by the librarian w n c carleton who recommended in a memorandum to the trustees  that  the custodian of the wing foundation should be responsible for the care guardianship classification and cataloging of the collection as well as provide assistance to readers who use the collection  the highest priority for purchasing books should be given to those books that will be representative and typical specimens of the work of all the typographically or historically important printers and presses of europe and north america  in purchasing these books special emphasis should be given to the period    materials pertinent to the interests of wing foundation already owned by the newberry library should be transferred to the wing foundation at the annual meeting in january  the trustees passed a resolu w f poole the founding librarian had collected materials in fine printing and bibliography from the inception of the library in  carleton reported that extensive lists were prepared for purchasing books among them lists for bibliography and the history of printing  p  by  the collection in these areas was of sufficient strength that a checklist was published book arts pt  bibliography printing bookbinding publishing  bookselling national  trade bibliography 
 the library quarterly tion concerning the establishment of the wing foundation the most pertinent part is as follows resolved that the president edward l ryerson librarian w n c carleton and professor mclaughlin be appointed a committee with authority to prepare and report to this board as soon as practicable a scheme or plan for the expenditure of the income of the wing fund in the purchase of books under the terms and conditions of the wing will  this committee presented its report in april  report on policy  it consisted of three sections physical location administration and book policy in this discussion i will focus on the section on book policy  pp   which provides a definition of the emerging collecting policy wing will provided that funds be used to purchase materials in two subjects namely the history of printing and bibliography the report on policy  recommended that intensive purchasing in bibliography be postponed until the collection on the history of printing was well advanced on the grounds that it was impractical to develop collections on both subjects simultaneously further bibliography was well represented in chicago libraries but there was no collection on the history of printing in chicago this decision was not intended to preclude the purchase of important works on bibliography what should be the criteria for selecting books on the history of printing in a memorandum on the will of john m wing deceased from john m wilson a trustee addressed to the board of trustees wilson recommended that two classes of books should be purchased a books which in whole or in part treat the history and development of the arts of printing etc b those which in the opinion of the library authorities have a value as examples illustrating or exemplifying the history or development of the art of printing or engraving or book illustration  this recommendation was adopted in the report on policy  which also recommended that special attention be given to the following classes of books books representative of the period  books printed after  that are notable examples of fine printing or illustrate a significant development of the art of printing specimen books type sheets and type catalogs of type founders and printers and biographies of printers and type founders the report on policy  suggests that in purchasing these materials the aim should be selectivity rather than comprehensiveness the books selected should have literary biographical historical or artistic interest as well as typographical value through such a collection it should be possible for the typographer historian and bibliographer  to trace  from original materials every significant development of the arts of printing and book production 
john m wing foundation  this report also recommends that the preparation of lists of books on the history of printing be begun immediately in accordance with the principles of choice and selection recommended above  p  the report on policy  was adopted by the trustees in april   an immediate result of the adoption of this report was a survey of the existing collections to determine which typographical material was available this survey was begun in  under the supervision of pierce butler head of the order department w n c carleton the librarian was promoting the wing foundation during the period when the trustees formulated and approved the plans for establishing the wing foundation his activity is illustrated by an interesting exchange of letters with d b updike in which the latter was seeking to sell a rare copy of moxon mechanick exercises to the newberry in a letter of april   from carleton to updike carleton writes i regret to report that our trustees have not yet authorized the purchase of books from the wing income but plans are working out more happily at present than they were some months ago and i am hopeful that in another two months active purchasing may be begun two months later in a letter of june  carleton again writes to updike at last the purchase of books for the wing foundation is under way a few books were purchased in the next six months active purchasing though did not begin until the first custodian was appointed in january  the trustees sought advice from various experts regarding the appointment of a custodian but failed to find an appropriate candidate in a letter of april   to frederick ives carpenter a trustee carleton writes i think our best plan at first will be to appoint a certain man on the library staff to the position the one i have in mind is an excellent bibliographer is experienced in the administration of special collections has excellent command of foreign languages and would be fully competent to aid me in the early stages of organization arrangement and selection of the material to be acquired formative beginnings under the custodianship of pierce butler   pierce butler was born december   in clarendon hills illinois after receiving his undergraduate education at dickinson college and  biographical information concerning butler is drawn largely from stanley pargellis pierce butler a biographical sketch  see also bernard i bell pierce butler professor and priest 
 the library quarterly teaching in a preparatory school for one year he decided to prepare for teaching medieval history he studied at union theological seminary   and received a bd degree from hartford seminary in  he also received an ma degree in german literature from dickinson college in  and a phd in church history from hartford seminary in  unable to find a teaching position he entered the parish ministry but left a year later owing to problems his deafness presented in the conduct of parish work after being employed as a clerk for the burlington railroad in chicago he obtained a position in the order department of the newberry library in  the report on policy  recommended that there be a survey to determine which typographical material was in the library collection one of pierce butler early contributions at the library was to compare bibliographies with the library catalog to determine the newberry holdings he began this survey in mid  and completed it in  a list of the most important guides and bibliographies used in this survey was included in the  report of the trustees of the newberry library  pp   in addition it is likely that butler used verzeichniss der sammlungen des borsenvereins der deutschen buchhrndler  the catalog of the bibliothek des borsenvereins der deutschen buchhandler at leipzig and gallia typographica  since the trustees had decided to give special attention to selecting examples of printing during the period   butler surveyed the incunabula holdings first and his results were recorded as check list of incunabula in the newberty library  this list contains  titles acquired by the library from  to  mostly en bloc acquisitions a revised checklist was issued in  and the final edition of the checklist published in  contains additional information on the library incunabula holdings before the establishment of the wing foundation  pp xiv xv by january  important decisions had been made for the wing foundation that would affect its future first the trustees had established a financial basis and administrative framework second based on the provisions of wing will the trustees had developed a collecting policy third butler was making a survey of existing typographical holdings fourth on the recommendation of carleton the trustees appointed butler as the first custodian of the wing foundation based on the report on policy  butler wrote a typographical library the john m wing foundation of the newberry library  as a whole the article describes the character and scope of the wing foundation of interest to us is that a significant portion of the article is devoted to the principles of book selection that would guide the development of the new collection
john m wing foundation  butler began by observing that the wing foundation reflecting the newberry interests in the humanities would be concerned with the humanities of typography in contrast with other collections on typography namely bibliothek of borsenrerein at leipzig the st bride foundation in london and the typographical library of american type founders company in jersey city  pp   the special interest of the wing foundation would be to instruct correct and inspire the makers and users of books in the higher aspects of typographic art  p  in order to accomplish this goal the collection would be developed along the following lines  it would collect examples of printing through which the invention spread and development of printing could be traced in its early years as well as related materials for every printer or press down to the present day whose work is of real significance for the subsequent course of the art  p  further it would collect the literature concerning the history of printing as defined above  it would also select those examples of printing that present solutions to problems of letter construction page arrangement and illustration as well as secondary literature pertinent to those concerns  the collection of examples of printing were supposed to include fine examples of the best work that has been accomplished in every important species of printing  p  to serve as a source of inspiration to typographical workers thus the wing foundation intended to collect primary and secondary materials for inquiring into the history of printing whether the purposes of the inquiry be instruction in the typographic arts or for documenting their historical development the principles used to select examples of printing were to be applied with appropriate changes to the selection of incunabula an incunabulum could be selected as an original document of the history of printing that is a book that contains references to the invention and early development of printing as an example of the manner in which the early craftsman solved problems of typography and book design particularly the complicated problems of letter forms or for its aesthetic value butler observed that in the history of fine printing it is a noteworthy fact that nearly every master has been a careful student of the work of early printers  p  he concluded his discussion of the selection of incunabula by directing attention to the textual importance of these works whenever consistent with the guiding principles an in when butler surveyed existing collections and compiled the check list of incunabula in the newbmy library in  he was interested in determining the library holdings of incunabula that refer to printing for this purpose he used aksel g s josephson the literature of the invention of printing a bibliographical study  of the twenty seven incunabula listed in this article butler discovered that the library already owned most of the titles
 the library quarterly cunabulum should be selected for its literary or historical value butler wrote if this interest is given its proper value the incunabula collection will become an approximate equivalent of what a good institutional library must have been in the early years of the sixteenth century  p  in approving the report on policy  the trustees agreed that initial purchases should concentrate on examples of printing from the period   later they approved butler program for purchasing incunabula  pp ix x butler traveled to europe in     and  to purchase incunabula of the  incunabula he selected during   three fourths were purchased during these trips by number and year the purchases were  in   in   in   in  and  in  for a total of  these extensive purchases were made possible by the unique market conditions of the decade following world war   before leaving on the first trip he obtained lists of incunabula holdings of the university of chicago library and the john crerar library to avoid unnecessary duplication in the chicago area by the end of  the newberry library had accumulated a collection of  incunabula representing nine countries seventy eight cities and  presses butler aggressive program of incunabula purchases increased the library holdings to  by  of this total only ninety three titles acquired by  were duplicated in the university of chicago library or the john crerar library among these duplicates about sixty had been acquired by the newberry library before the wing foundation was established through the purchases of incunabula butler continually reaffirmed the collecting policy stated earlier in  butler explained his selections of incunabula for the wing foundation as follows my incunabula mission was to secure typical material illustrating all possible phases of the development of printing from its invention to the close of the fifteenth century my second task was to select whenever a choice was possible books which contained those texts that were most significant of the intellectual interests and methods of scholarship current in that period  p xvi at the same time butler selected incunabula representative of countries towns printers or presses and type specimens his selections were determined in part by his desire to develop a collection arranged by robert proctor classification and type identification system proctor system classified works by place of origin  buder account of these trips is recorded in incunabula markets of europe  and in  pp xv xix
john m wing foundation  that is countries and towns and by printers and it illustrated the spread of printing through the development of new typefaces in spite of the excellent collection of incunabula developed through butler use of the proctor scheme the practice did lead to a few fundamental weaknesses in the collection according to james m wells a later custodian of the wing foundation  p  in attempting to document typography according to the proctor scheme butler on occasion chose a less important book if it illustrated a typeface he wanted and sometimes he would buy an incomplete copy to obtain a certain typeface nonetheless butler systematic selections by this method made possible investigations into the history of printing that purchases of merely aesthetically pleasing or rarer works might not have permitted though he emphasized the development of the incunabula collection butler also acquired notable examples of printing from the sixteenth to the early twentieth centuries early in  the library acquired the complete set of books printed by william morris at the kelmscott press   presumably fifty two works in sixty six volumes butler justification for purchasing all the works printed by morris rather than representative works as was the stated policy for modern presses was that morris constantly experimented and thus the serious student must have knowledge of the entire group in order to appreciate particular examples   pp   the collection of the wing foundation was augmented by donations from printers and printing firms in chicago these gifts were attracted by the establishment of a typographical library at the newberry having achieved many of his goals of developing the incunabula collection butler was eventually able to direct more attention to the purchase of sixteenth century imprints in  he reported that the library had accumulated  titles of sixteenth century imprints acquiring examples of printing did not preclude the purchase of other materials relating to printing particularly as defined by the collecting policy the personal library of theodore de vinne was sold at public auction in january   p  of the  titles of typographical interest desired for the wing foundation butler acquired  titles  p  the trustees reports from  to  indicate a special interest in obtaining type specimen books of which  were purchased in  and another fifty six in  materials were acquired on the following topics type design the invention of printing early developments in printing biographies of notable printers histories of famous presses and especially bibliographies of printing and allied subjects these purchases led to an increased public awareness of the wing foundation it was used by type designers and printers to study exam
 the library quarterly ples of printing and by scholars in considering the typographical evidence bearing on problems of literary history awareness by an even wider public came through exhibits prepared by butler drawing on materials in the wing foundation there were several educational activities related to the wing foundation for example it hosted traveling exhibits of the american institute of graphic arts provided space for evening lectures on fine printing and furnished materials for an educational film produced by the united typothetae of america in  and  classes on the problems of printing were offered in cooperation with the society of typographic arts which had been founded in  in chicago when the graduate library school of the university of chicago was opened for students in  butler was engaged on a part time basis to teach courses in the history of printing and related subjects his experience at the wing foundation preeminently qualified him to teach in this field butler resigned as custodian of the wing foundation in september  to assume full time responsibilities at the graduate library school but continued his association with the newberry library both as a reader and on occasion as an advisor to his successors in  after his retirement from the graduate library school and just before his death he returned to the newberry library as a visiting fellow further developments under the custodianship of ernst f detterer   ernst f detterer was born in bethlehem pennsylvania in  he received his ab from moravian college in  and was a student at the school of industrial art at the pennsylvania museum from  to  for several weeks in  he studied calligraphy privately with edward johnston after that he was an instructor in art at the chicago normal college and from  to  was head of its art department then at the school of the art institute in chicago he headed the department of printing arts and taught courses in printing arts and calligraphy until  detterer was appointed custodian of the wing foundation in  a position he held until his death in  he had a life long interest in the history of books book production and especially in type design the collecting policy set forth in report on policy  and subse perhaps the most significant was represented in the exhibit catalog the first fifty years of the pnrnted book   notes descriptive of an exhibition 
john m wing foundation  quently clarified by butler was continued during the custodianship of detterer although the collecting policy remained unchanged different patterns of collecting did emerge the nearest resemblance to a significant change in the collecting policy was the expansion into calligraphy perhaps the most important shift in the pattern of collecting was that from fifteenth century books to sixteenth century books butler himself had noted the decreasing supply and increasing cost of incunabula which would result in fewer purchases of such books it appears that detterer never acquired more than five incunabula in any given year and probably acquired no more than forty titles during his seventeen years as custodian he did develop with considerable vigor the collection of sixteenthcentury imprints giving special attention to the beautiful illustrated books of that period  p  particularly french imprints his concern for sixteenth century imprints was reflected not only in his acquisitions but also in the directives issued for cataloging them in a memorandum issued to the technical division on march   he notes that sixteenth century imprints should be represented in the catalog by the following added entries printer town chronology binder illustrator and book plate this was an extension of the policy that already applied to the cataloging of incunabula he also acquired more imprints of private presses in england and america than did his predecessor he was especially interested in collecting examples of modern fine printing and placed an emphasis on acquiring printers manuals and books of type specimens the beginning of the modern revival of calligraphy as well as the emergence of the private press can be traced to william morris  in england the most important figure during the rebirth of interest in calligraphy was the englishman edward johnston    detterer had studied with johnston in london and was strongly influenced by him johnston influence can be further detected in students of detterer such as r hunter middleton and james hayes teaching from writing  illuminating  lettering  in his classes at the art institute detterer was one of the first to bring johnston ideas and techniques to the united states  p  shortly after detterer was appointed custodian of the wing foundation he attempted to acquire the private calligraphic collection of c lindsay ricketts in  the trustees decided that the price asked for the collection was too high detterer attempted again to persuade the trustees in  and this time had the support of alfred e hamill a collector of calligraphy and president of the trustees in a memorandum to the book committee april  detterer made his appeal to purchase the ricketts collection his purpose was to
 the library quarterly recommend a policy regarding the purchase of collateral material in a field related to the wing collection of type specimen books that is in the field of specimen books of calligraphy  the justification for including calligraphy within the scope of the collection he stated as follows from the european invention of printing in the fifteenth century when the chief book and document hands furnished the patterns for the earliest typefaces the main external influence on the design of typefaces has been the styles of script practiced by the contemporary writing master  after citing instances of the relationship between calligraphy and type design from the sixteenth through the twentieth centuries detterer observed that this relationship had not been thoroughly investigated probably due to the lack of available collections of calligraphic and typographic material of sufficient extent to form the basis of such a study  the trustees approved the purchase of a collection of fifty three manuscripts and  printed books this purchase in  immediately made the newberry a principal center for calligraphic study the collection in calligraphy was augmented regularly most significantly by alfred hamill bequest of more than  books and manuscripts in  a few months after acquisition of the ricketts collection there had been some agitation in the society of typographic arts for a calligraphic study group drawn from its members who would meet under the aegis of the newberry library  p  on june   detterer wrote a letter inviting fourteen members of the society of typographic arts to meet at the library on june  to form the newberry library calligraphy study group according to james hayes the formation of the group was a direct result of the purchase by the library of the ricketts collection  p  charter members of this group included such well known figures in calligraphy and type design as r hunter middleton raymond da boll and james hayes  pp    pp   as their first project the members of this group voted to examine all of the examples of calligraphy then in the wing foundation meetings were held once a week in the rare book room of the library the completion of this project required nearly two years and during the course of this time conversations in meetings often wandered from the immediate calligraphic work under consideration and touched on any topic connected with calligraphy and type design in this way the newberry library calligraphy study group developed into something like a  a brief description of hamill collection selected to supplement the ricketts collection is found in 
john m wing foundation  school of writing lettering and graphic design probably unique in its kind it exercised a remarkable influence throughout the american midwest  p  this emphasis on calligraphy increased the public knowledge of the wing foundation and encouraged the active use of the collection other notable en bloc acquisitions during the custodianship of detterer included a small collection of stone and kimball imprints  and   p   p  a gift of materials relating to f w goudy an american type designer containing type specimens documentation for type design and books printed at the village press   p  books from the personal library of william a kittredge a chicago designer which included  books kittredge considered notable examples of book design as well as a large quantity of printed materials such as announcements stationery catalogs and christmas cards   pp   and a collection of original close up drawings and designs of oswald b cooper   visiting fellows during   ernst detterer died suddenly on november   and a successor was not appointed until august  the librarian of the newberry stanley pargellis   was responsible for the care of the wing foundation  p  during these years visiting fellows played a significant role in the wing foundation a visiting fellowship was a research grant for scholars who wished to work in the library collections in return for the grant the visiting fellow divided time between his research and advising the library in his special field stanley morison was one of these visiting fellows morison was a leader in the movement to raise typographical standards in the machine press age he was a coeditor of the first four volumes and editor of the last three volumes of the fleuron   and typographical consultant to many companies and presses including the monotype corporation the times and cambridge university press he was first introduced to the wing foundation through correspondence with d b updike in  morison used the calligraphy collection of c lindsay ricketts in wilmette illinois in  for the preparation of an article on calligraphy for the encyclopaedia britannica he had additional contact with the wing foundation through pierce butler whom he met in europe when the latter was searching for incunabula in  morison became acquainted with stanley pargellis there  see 
 the library quarterly were two major results morison was appointed as a visiting fellow of the wing foundation in the spring of  and he advised pargellis concerning the appointment of a successor to ernst detterer  pp  soon after detterer death pargellis wrote to morison asking for advice he responded by proposing candidates for the custodianship and by volunteering to spend some time in chicago with whomever was selected as the next custodian morison was to visit the library as a visiting fellow nearly every year from  to  in the autumn of  the library honored him by presenting an exhibition of his work konrad bauer was appointed as a visiting fellow of the wing foundation in  he was the art director at the bauer type foundry and was associated with the university of mainz one of bauer suggestions for the wing foundation was that changes in printing and illustration styles be traced by using the works of one author as a constant this could be done by concentrating on an author who had been heavily published in the early days of printing and who had had a relatively continuous publishing history up to the present  p  bauer specifically suggested a comprehensive collection of terence or plautus the library followed bauer plan with the works of terence since that author was already strongly represented in the library holdings incidentally there was an exchange of letters between pargellis and bauer in which the latter declines the opportunity to become custodian of the wing foundation in  there were a number of important en bloc acquisitions just before a new custodian assumed responsibility for the collection these acquisitions included letters written to bruce rogers examples of seventeenth century italian calligraphy and the gift of a large collection of the papers of platt rogers spencer  items which augmented the calligraphy collection  pp   also a complete leaf of the line bible was purchased both morison and bauer had a significant influence on the development of the wing foundation in these years between custodians recent developments during the custodianship of james m wells   james m wells was born in west virginia and following undergraduate studies at northwestern university obtained an ma degree in english literature from columbia university after further studies and teaching he was awarded a traveling fellowship from the american council of learned societies acls to do research in london from  to  on william morris and the arts and crafts movement
john m wing foundation  stanley pargellis was among those who had reviewed wells application for the acls fellowship and through stanley morison arranged for wells to visit the library in  wells was appointed custodian the same year but remained in london until  to conclude his research he began work as custodian on september   wells continued to carry forward the collecting policy proposed in the report on policy  clarified by butler in a typographical library  and expanded under detterer in  he purchased all the same categories of material acquired by his predecessors because of the maturity of the collection by this time and the decreasing availability of some types of materials wells began to alter the pattern of collecting he defined his task as building a collection rather than a group of illmatched high spots  p  and sought to do this by filling gaps where he found them the purchase of incunabula for instance was normally limited to a half dozen titles in a year but there were substantial purchases of incunabula in the following years twenty three in  twenty in  and forty in  in  the library purchased the silver collection which consisted primarily but not exclusively of first and early editions of literary texts from europe and england during the period of the renaissance books printed by william caxton were included in this notable acquisition  p   the holdings of sixteenth century imprints from italy and especially france were also strengthened although pierce butler concentrated on developing an incunabula collection representative of countries towns printers and typefaces the tendency since  has been to emphasize the significance of the text particularly in relation to the library interests in promoting renaissance studies the calligraphy collection was augmented regularly particularly by italian french and american writing books there was increased emphasis given to the acquisition of ephemeral printing one of the most notable of these acquisitions in  was the collection of bodoni giambatista an influential printer of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries it consists of a group of  broadsides proofsheets letterheads passports and similar material produced by the royal printing office at parma  pp   in  a collection of  broadsides from the seventeenth century was acquired  p  while butler had concentrated on the fifteenth century and detterer on the sixteenth century neither had acquired much material exemplifying printing processes during the machine press period except as occasional examples of fine printing wells was interested in acquiring notable examples of photomechanical printing further he acquired the necessary materials with which the development of color printing could

john m wing foundation  whose customers included thomas jefferson   p  and the archive consisting of letters and work records of george salter a calligrapher illustrator and book designer who worked for leading publishers in america in the twentieth century  p  during the closing years of the work of james m wells there were four diverse and important acquisitions  a collection of  pamphlets dealing with the regulation of printing bookselling and censorship in france from  to  together with a number of manuscripts on the subject and an extensive chronological table in manuscript covering    p   a gift from r r donnelley and sons of private press books examples of fine printing and reference books numbering almost  items  incidentally after the newberry selected these items the regenstein library at the university of chicago selected the items it needed and those books not required by either library were sold with the proceeds being divided between the two libraries  a gift from robert h brannan a retired member of the staff of private press books and fine printing primarily by thomas bewick  p   a gift of papers of the chiswick book shop in new york city dated   which included letters between herbert cohen the owner and persons such as will ransom stanley pargellis and james wells  this last gift was presented in recognition of the career of james m wells on the occasion of his retirement february   one of the most notable events during the custodianship of wells was the publication of book catalogs of the wing foundation by g k hall and company thereby making the collection accessible to scholars everywhere the first catalog was published in  with supplements being published in  and    more than the usual amount of detail has been included in the entries enhancing the catalogs usefulness where known provenance for each title is listed entries are heavily annotated and often contained bibliographical information not readily available elsewhere a great deal of the credit for the painstaking cataloging belongs to bernard e wilson who cataloged almost all of the additions to the collection between  and  besides the standard author title and subject entries the catalogs provided separate chronological and place name sections incunabula are cataloged according to the proctor scheme with works entered under place of origin that is countries and towns and by printers other books acquired as examples of printing were cataloged by an  paul f gehl phd university of chicago was appointed curator of the john m wing foundation on june  
 the library quarterly adaptation of the proctor scheme century place and printer were noted for these post  titles the newberry calligraphy study group founded by detterer in  continued after  under the leadership of james hayes it discontinued its activities in  but the calligraphy collection is still used frequently and intensively and there are courses in calligraphy available in the newberry library lyceum the library supported the activities of the society of typographic arts by accommodating a printing workshop in the library from  through  the wing foundation continued to be used by a wide variety of readers although no statistical information is available the impression is that there were substantially more publications completed with the use of the wing foundation during   than during   reflecting the increased size and maturity of the collection as well as convenient access to it through published catalogs wells himself has written more than thirty articles on calligraphy the history of printing and typography for reference works and scholarly journals plus numerous short pieces for the newberry libraiy bulletin and the anhual reports the growth of the library fellowship program and increased interest in the history of the book as a field of study has resulted in extensive use of the wing foundation perhaps the most significant change in the use of the wing foundation is that scholars find texts selected as examples of printing required for research in a wide range of subjects conclusion the john m wing foundation on the history of printing collects materials from western europe great britain and america in the following categories literary or historical texts selected as a representative specimen of a printer an aspect of the printing process or as a physical feature of the book for example design or illustration printers manuals type specimen books or other material that can provide information concerning the development of printing processes from contemporary sources writing books and calligraphic manuscripts of notable scribes from the fifteenth century to the present day because of the connection between calligraphy and type design manuscript and archival material that provides original documentation for printing processes and notable printers and reference materials consisting of bibliographies history biographies and monographs that are essential to use the primary sources enumerated above the subject scope of this reference collection consists primarily of
john m wing foundation  printing history and related subjects book illustration paper making and bookbinding books on publishing and bookselling are collected to the extent that the historical relationship between printing and the book trade requires the use of such material materials on book collecting are also a part of the collection one of the remarkable features of the wing foundation is the degree of continuity in its policy over a period of almost seventy years this is a credit to the foresight of those who formulated the original collecting policy transforming john m wing will into enduring and flexible guidelines it is also a credit to the three custodians between  and  indeed the length of their tenure provided enough latitude so that each one could make a distinctive contribution working within the constraints of a clear and open collecting policy each custodian was free to develop the collection according to changing needs and even his personal interests since the wing foundation was developed in the context of the comprehensive collections of the newberry the custodian could be highly selective in the acquisitions the benefit of this library within a library is that the funds from the wing endowment could be used only for the wing collection rather than for the supporting materials this made possible a clarity of purpose and specificity of scope for the wing foundation that ought to characterize a research collection references  wing john mansir a great wing library the owl  june     john mansir wing the owl  march     wing conway p a historical and genealogical register of john wing of sandwich mass and his descendants and his descendants   d ed new york de vinne press   wing john m the great union stock yards of chicago chicago religio philosophical publishing assn   wing john m the great chicago lake tunnel chicago jack wing   wing john m history of the great chicago tunnel chicago jack wing   wing john m attributed wing illustrated travelersnd visitorsand book to the city of chicago chicago j m wing  co   wing john m attributed the tunnels and water system of chicago chicago j m wing  co   wing john m old coner library scrap book about books bibliography book plates libraries and other things picked up here and there by a philosopher chicago pasted at the old corner library   wing john m family trees and genealogy wing family of america chicago old corner library   last will and testament of john m wing  draft  last will and testament of john m wing  final version  report of the trustees of the newbery library
