early printing and the book trade in the west indies roderick cave this paper considers developments in printing prior to  in the british colonies in the caribbean plus those dutch danish french and swedish colonial possessions which were influenced by the british islands the reasons for the establishment of presses in these west indian colonies are examined official printing newspapers periodicals and ephemera formed the mainstay of the west indian printer business though there was some literary publication at the end of the eighteenth century accompanied by the start of subscription libraries the decline of the planter class and the weakening of the sugar colonies economic position prevented indigenous publishing from developing successfully at the time of the independence of the not far distant american colonies the west indian islands were established and rich colonies in several of which printing had long been exercised kingston jamaica was preceded only by boston in the publication of a regular weekly newspaper barbados had printing before south carolina antigua and st christopher better known as st kitts before north carolina and new jersey  pp   although by the time the thirteen american colonies became independent printing had not been introduced into all the west indian islands  and was not to reach some of them for a remarkably long time  there were sufficient centers and enough work being produced for us to consider the west indian printer as distinct from the american colonial printer and to make a study of early printing and the book trade in the caribbean of some interest there are of course many difficulties in an attempt of this kind the  the research for this paper was in part made possible by a daniels fellowship at the american antiquarian society to which my thanks are due as to the other libraries on whose holdings i have drawn the paper was originally delivered at a meeting of the liverpool bibliographical society in may   printing was not introduced into the turks islands until the mid s or the dutch island of aruba until the beginning of this century in the cayman islands there was no press until after world war ii library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago    
 the library quarterly geographical limits of the west indies are imprecise and the patterns of political control constantly changed until the end of the napoleonic wars bibliographical history is but one minor aspect of cultural history and one can no more account for printing developments in many of the islands except against the backdrop of their constant transfer back and forth between france and england than one could disregard the war of independence in considering massachusetts printing in the s even for those colonies like jamaica and barbados which remained securely british the economic and social effects of the political kaleidoscope had a distinct effect the west indies in fact is not a unit each island had its distinctive political and cultural history just as it had its own racial and religious mix english administrators in the early nineteenth century often found it extremely difficult to cope with this complexity that st lucia was governed under prerevolutionary french law trinidad by spanish law or demerara according to the regulations of the dutch west india company so difficult was it that in at least one instance advice had to be sought from the previous colonizing power these local differences had their bibliographical effect notably in control of the periodical press a further difficulty in the study of early printing and the book trade in the area arises from the dearth of material on the book trade in the west indies with a handful of exceptionsisaiah thomas douglas mcmurtrie bradford swanhistorians of typography have ignored it there have been no regional studies and the accounts of printing on individual islands have been written in most cases by local historians often amateur without special interest in bibliographical niceties and without access to a wide range of material for the documents printed in the indies which must form the basis for such accounts are excessively rare with the exception of a handful of caribbean libraries with respectable collections of local printing west indiana is not to be found in the islands at all instead it is in the archives of the colonizing powers and in some of the research libraries of europe and north america such as the royal library stockholm orjohn carter brown or the bodleian   in the mid s the british foreign office had to seek explanation and elucidation from the hague to clarify the role of the court of policy in the government of demerara  pp   similar problems had been encountered earlier with spanish law in trindad by governors picton and hislop   jerome handler guide to source materials for the study of barbados history   carbondale ill southern illinois university press  is the only adequate guide to resources of the kind needed for a definitive study lowell ragatz seminal guide for the study of british caribbean history   washington dc carnegie corp  is fatally flawed for this purpose by the lack of locations for works cited
printing and book trade in the west indies  the present study limited originally to those west indian territories which are part of the british commonwealth has been extended to include those other caribbean territories which had a formal british presence or british influence long enough to have bibliographical implications in fact this definition let in all the territories of all the other european colonial powers with the exception of spain the spanish colonies bibliographical history is so different from that of the other powers denmark france holland and sweden that it seemed more helpful to leave it out of consideration save in the case of trinidad which was not taken from the spanish by britain until  on the other hand those british dutch and french colonies in central and south america whose cultural and economic and bibliographical ties were with the caribbean colonies were included for the purposes of this study therefore west indies includes bermuda the bahamas belize british honduras and the guianas but excludes cuba and puerto rico the cutoff point for the study is  as the date of the morant bay rebellion in jamaica and almost exactly a century and a half from the introduction of printing it is a particularly appropriate terminal point for the study of that island for the british islands of the eastern caribbean  would have been more meaningful but for the area as a whole any date is arbitrary however the sixties or early seventies were in most cases the nadir of the islands cultural and economic success and provide a reasonable dividing point between the period in which printing catered to the planter class and that of the emergence of new nationalist movements in purely typographic terms also these decades mark the break between old hand production and the mechanized methods which assumed a more important place in the last third of the nineteenth century the early west indian book trade between the discovery of the west indies by columbus in the s and the introduction of printing into the islands there was a period of over two centuries of european colonization it was of course slow for nearly a century after columbus the settlement was limited to the spanish but from the early seventeenth century on there was effective settlement by the british dutch and french and rather later by the danes of course the pattern of settlement was uneven st vincent remained largely under carib control until the second half of the eighteenth century for instance by  there were substantial numbers of englishmen in st kitts barbados and jamaica of frenchmen in

printing and book trade in the west indies  earthquake which devastated port royal in  was printed by william bradford in new york  p  similarly when the barbados assembly passed a bill about privateers in  it prayed the governor and council that the bill should be sent to new england to be printed and printed it was also by william bradford in new york  p  to use the resources of one colony to fill the needs of another was a commonplace device of the old empire it was one which was to continue in the west indies for many years after the introduction of the first presses thus jamaican printers were employed to print material for the british settlements in the bay of honduras  and in the cayman islands antiguan printers supplied the wants of the british virgin islands nevis was served from st kitts political changes in the eighteenth century often imposed other temporary patterns of trade in which for example french royalist printers in dominica printed material for circulation in martinique or st kitts printers moved for safety to the dutch island of st eustatius most of such patterns are easily explained in terms of trade or shipping routes or the political and administrative structure  but some intercolonial trade in printing is much harder to understand why did the abbe roland have his mercure des antilles which was intended for circulation in st domingue printed with great trouble in jamaica  how did the printers of the bridgetown ledger in  secure the position of printers to the constabulary in british honduras almost  miles distant from barbados in some cases there is no doubt that the tiny local market on any one island was an influential factor at any rate in the eastern caribbean  for instance when in  henry thornhill wrote a narrative of the insurrection and rebellion in the island of grenada immediately after the rebellion was crushed he was unable to get it printed on the island as the one local printer had already undertaken publication of thomas turner wise review of the events which happened in grenada st george  even when in  thornhill moved to barbados he found the publisher of the barbados mercury equally unwilling only when a new printing house set up in business the following year was he able to have recourse to the proprietor thereof who was pleased to undertake and print the following sheets  pp   the circumstances under which printers were introduced to the colonies follow several patterns  both the bay settlements and the caymans came within the area administered by the governors of jamaica for example  for distribution of locally printed books see below publications of the west indian printers
 the library quarterly a government controlled press introduced at the wish of the local population and authorities in the case of the first press in the antilles that of robert baldwin in jamaica  the council of the island and the governordesignate sir nicolas lawes obtained permission from london for the introduction of a press to persuade the commissioners for trade and plantations however sir nicolas suggested that there should be but one and that licensed to the govr for the time being and for the first year or two each issue of the weekly jamaica courant carried an imprimatur  p  in belize the first press was a public press  in the dutch colony of demerara a similar situation obtained for the press of j c de la coste in support of whose wish to start a paper the court of policy applied to the hague for approval  pp   pressesfor which a privilege had been granted by the metropolitan power this was the pattern in the french islands and an unsuccessful one a brevet dmprimeur was granted to a bookseller from metz named joseph payen for the isles sous le vent in april  however when the unfortunate printer arrived in st domingue governor de la rochelard prevented him from establishing his printing office and had him imprisoned for selling obscene books on his release still circumvented by the governor payen was unwise enough to print the text of his letters patent at leogane with the false statement that it was par ordre de m le chevalier de rochelard for which he was again imprisoned this time he got the message and left for france as soon as released the next printer did not set up office until   pp   it appears that the authorities in martinque were no more welcoming than in st domingue though a brevet dmprimeur was granted in  it was not until the s that a printer set up in the island  p  a brevet dmprimeur for guadeloupe was granted by louis xv to jean benard in june  and he established himself in basse terre the following spring  pp    in only one instance does metropolitan planning seem to have envisaged sending out a press as a part of first settlement of a new colony though planning may be the wrong word for the crackbrained scottish schemes in darien nevertheless william simpson printer of edinburgh was contracted to perform the printing needed by the scottish settlers at forty shillings per month and had the venture succeeded darien would have been the first caribbean colony with its own press  p  presses established as entrepreneurial ventures the press set up in barbados by benjamin franklin old colleague david harry in  and the
printing and book trade in the west indies  antigua press which franklin set up in  under his employee thomas smith and after smith death franklin own nephew benjamin mecom appear to have been normal business ventures undertaken by shrewd businessmen   later in the century j stockdale establishment of a press in bermuda followed the same commercial instincts  while in many instances the establishment of second or subsequent printing houses in a colony came from the expectation often disappointed that the local society could support several printers presses established as a result of conquest or occupation  in many instances english language papers issued from presses run by british subjects rapidly followed the pattern of conquest joseph berrow in st lucia in the early s and matthew gallagher in trinidad from  are instances of the printing trade following the flag other british printers were active in curasao  pp   and in the danish virgin islands during the british occupation in the napoleonic wars similarly there was a press with the british expeditionary force in st domingue   while during napoleon abortive attempts to reconquer the island there was also a french press in the city of santo domingo itself in other instances after conquest printers already established in a colony merely trimmed their sails to the wind george burnett was imprimeur du roi in tobago during the french occupation in the late s while in guadeloupe one ginet was official printer during the british occupation   pp   presses established as an escapefrom waron several islands printing was introduced as a result of wars elsewhere save in nassau to which john wells printer of the east florida gazette moved when st augustine was evacuated by the british in  the loyalists were not responsible for the spread of printing  however there seems little doubt that the introduction of printing into the dutch island of st eustatius statia in the late s and into the swedish colony of st bartholomew in the early years of the nineteenth century resulted from the unsettled state of the neighboring islands  pp    several loyalists were of importance in the colonial book trade in jamaica however william aikman from annapolis and his brother alexander aikman who had worked in charleston sc for robert wells father of john wells of nassau and was to become king printer and a very wealthy man
 the library quarterly presses established through colonial pride in belize though the first press was publicly owned its introduction may be taken as an instance of local pride  pp   it may possibly have been a misguided entrepreneurial instinct which led samuel nelmes to set up shop in grand turk in  but the separatist movement which three years later succeeded in having the turks islands removed from control of nassau and made into a separate colony was also influential  as no copies of the carriacou observer seem to survive it is not possible to say why alexander murray set up there in the mid s unless the independent spirit of the inhabitants of this tiny island in the grenadines a chain of islets between st vincent and grenada was an influential factor it seems an improbable choice for a purely commercial venture presses set up with official support to counter prevailing attitudes  in several instances when the editorial tone of an existing colonial paper aroused official displeasure other printers were invited to set up in competition thus in bermuda when the printers of the bermuda gazette had published some libelous attacks on governor hodgson he invited edmund ward from halifax to become king printer  pp   the recalcitrant attitude of the planters and their newspapers in the period immediately before and after the emancipation of the slaves in  led to the establishment of papers in both jamaica and trinidad which propounded the home government colonial policies  vol  pp   presses set up for special political or religious reasons in the nineteenth century as the number of presses increased some were set up deliberately to further the interests of particular groups in general the older established papers reflected the interests of the planters and merchants in both jamaica and barbados papers of a liberal cast which were aimed at the colored population appeared from the s on in other cases catholic papers were produced in guyana the gold rush of the s led to the production of such special interest papers as the nugget and the gold mining gazette in the same colony the s saw the publication ofa voz portuguez a liberdade and other portuguese papers catering to the madeiran element in the population though some unusual features appear in these different categories no doubt there is considerable resemblance to the expansion of printing in other parts of the world it is worth remembering though that the west indies were more dangerous and presented more difficulties to the intending printer than is apparent from this dry account losses at sea
printing and book trade in the west indies  were not uncommon earthquakes and hurricanes took a regular toll in one instance a printer adventures had a hollywood epic quality donald mcphee lee having gone from bermuda to halifax to obtain types for his new paper the royal gazette reembarked for bermuda in the sloop sally ann in october  the master of the sloop had no chronometer and little knowledge of navigation and for two months the vessel drifted around the gulf stream until provisions had run out and the vessel was dismasted in a storm a spanish privateer was persuaded not to blow them out of the water but to replenish their supplies with lee navigating the sloop the captain having gone blind they made landfall in bermuda on the seventy seventh day out so carefully had lee guarded his heavy boxes that the crew were convinced they contained gold one can imagine their surprise when having carried them ashore through the surf the boxes were opened to reveal not gold but printing type  pp   the printers what sort of men were the early west indian printers and where did they come from this is an interesting question to which a partial answer is possible of particular interest is the role of the sephardic jews apparently responsible for the first press in curasaoll and certainly active in early printing in surinam  members of this small group were of great importance in nineteenth century jamaica where the daily gleaner the oldest of west indian newspapers still appearing remained under the control of the de cordova family for many years  in many instances it is possible to identify the printers who came to the islands with some precision whether jamaica first printer robert baldwin is to be identified with the stationers company apprentice freed by patrimony on february   is uncertain but in many instances it is possible to trace the printers earlier careers however sketchily the records preserved in the jamaica archives are rich in the  for example michael ryan proprietor of the barbados globe and printer to the assembly set sail from newfoundland to bridgetown in  in a vessel which disappeared without a trace  the inventory of the estate of jeosuah guidon mendes who died in curacao in  included a small printing press  i am indebted to eugene s richardson jr for this reference  he may have been connected with the baldwins who were active in the london book trade but no certain evidence has come to hand
 the library quarterly wills and inventories of the estates of those in the book trade one can learn much about many of these men robert sherlock a printer at spanish town and the first to exercise the art at montego bay for example was the son of robert sherlock printer in the strand london he was apprenticed to william mcfaden in  and when he died in  left an estate of some  most of which apart from provision for his housekeeper and bequests to friends was left to his younger brother thomas a printer in london no detailed study of these records has yet been made but they offer many interesting sidelights on the lives of the jamaican printers most like sherlock had colored mistresses only the most well to do printers seem to have been married to white women and even then their wills often include bequests to various side children the wills reveal the riches that could be gained by the successful james fannin of montego bay was worth nearly  on his death in  and alexander aikman some  in  and the relative poverty of others like alexander davidson whose work on thejamaica gazette in  resulted in an estate of no more than  in value these were of course master printers their employees seldom had estates worth making an inventory indeed often the only record of their existence that i have been able to trace is in the obituary columns in the jamaican press for a few of the more prosperous jamaican printers it is possible to establish family trees which illustrate the ramifications of their business concerns alexander aikman and his son of the same name controlled official printing in jamaica for many years and operated some successful bookselling and stationery ventures as well as the prosperous royal gazette another family the lunans controlled the st jago de la vega gazette and the kingston chronicle and various bookselling concerns for a long period the strupars had the jamaica courant and other papers under their control for nearly fifty years from the s onward for  i am indebted to donald mckenzie for assistance in identifying many west indian printers in the records of the stationers company  a preliminary list a digest of the wills and inventories of members of the jamaican book trade has been published in working papers on west indian pninting no    west indian attitudes to racial origins were ambivalent and different from those in the united states most housekeepermistresses were described as mulattoes or free women of color and were apparently free women of mixed blood rather than slaves or of pure african origin doubtless some of the white women like the printers they married were of mixed blood but were sufficiently high in the social scale for this to be forgotten  jamaican currency in sterling the sums quoted would be reduced by one third
printing and book trade in the west indies  such families printing and bookselling were but a part of their activities all these families owned extensive lands the aikmans the properties of wallenfield dunsinane and birnamwood the strupars the coffee plantation of bellevue in the port royal mountains they had made it into the ranks of the plantocracy it is also possible to reconstruct many details of the lives of such men from secondary sources yet only one printer in jamaica as far as i can trace has left a firsthand account of his affairs a series of autobiographical letters written by curds brett   to his son gives an excellent account of the way in which an industrious and lucky printer could make his fortune in the caribbean apprenticed to a dublin booksellerprinter who failed in business he moved to london where from  to  he worked for william strahan in  he was tempted by a gentleman going to jamaica to join him as a storekeeper and to invest his own small savings in a cargo of goods on his own account in jamaica he set up in partnership with another merchant lost everything and was reduced to working as a plantation overseer his fortunes gradually rose having become partner in an ironmonger business in spanish town the jamaican capital his background as a printer became known to various members of the assembly who wanted a press set up in that town as a counter to the kingston press with support from them he returned to london where he arranged the printing of an edition of the laws of jamaica by his old master to purchase equipment and on his return commenced publication of the st jago intelligencer on may   from that time to this he observed with some complacency i have never   been in want of money he was a capable printer and a hardworking one within five years he had amassed a fortune of some  and having had the marrow of the printing business    thought it proper to quit and turn merchant   few other islands have such rich records and it is particularly hard to gather such detail for them the earliest printers were often english sometimes scots or irish by the beginning of the nineteenth century scots printers predominated and the lack of centralized scottish records comparable to those of the stationers company make it difficult to trace their history before they went to the indies in the french colonies the early printers came from france as those in surinam were of dutch origin but in the danish virgin islands and in the netherlands antilles most of the early printers seem to have been of british birth or descent in the swedish island of st bartholomew the first printer was swedish but the press soon passed into english hands at what stage creole printers took over from the expatriates is difficult to judge the colonial printers took creole apprentices and by the early nineteenth century many printing businesses were owned by local men
 the library quarterly with local training but there was a steady if diminishing flow of craftsmen to the islands until the last days of colonial rule at any rate at the more senior levels the mobility of many of the printers who worked in the west indies was reminiscent of fifteenth century europe jean cassan had printed in grenada before moving to spanish trinidad matthew gallagher the first printer in trinidad under british rule had worked previously in dominica and grenada and was later to spend some time in caracas setting up the subsidiary firm of gallagher y lamb sextius buffardin originally from aix worked in both dominica and guadeloupe and joseph berrow in dominica then st lucia and finally st vincent where he was the first printer sometimes their moves came as a result of political changes sometimes because they saw economic advantage in moving to a fresh territory alexander holmes for example who had served his apprenticeship in edinburgh started the bermudian in st george as a rival to the long established bermuda gazette in  after some initial success he ran afoul of the governor and had to leave bermuda in    for a while he worked in a subordinate capacity in falmouth jamaica eventually in  managing to buy the plant and copyright of the old established cornwall chronicle in montego bay despite his editorial espousal of the planters cause in the controversy over emancipation an economic necessity with his early readership and in any case his was a less fanatical advocacy than that of some other jamaican papers he successfully conducted the paper until his death in  being remembered as a genial old scotchman  other expatriates were less fortunate than holmes as suggested above the risk of death from disease was not inconsiderable as late as  otto wenkstern a prussian who was proprietor of the trinidad chronicle fell a victim in the last great yellow fever epidemic to strike trinidad others who did not succumb were often shattered in health and had to sell their businesses or leave them in the hands of managers and return to temperate climes it was not only expatriates who suffered of course creole printers died young or had their health wrecked in the same way in one instance in the cable family business in st kitts robert cable who died from burns in  through having set his bed hangings on fire had been running the business since the age of fifteen in consequence of his father early death several other west indian printers had to assume editorialmanagerial responsibilities while still underage for similar reasons although the change of ownership of some west indian printing houses was rapid in other cases there were long dynasties in little st kitts the howes and cables ran rival concerns and papers for well over a century very little evidence survives on the conditions of employment of those
printing and book trade in the west indies  working for the master printers there is occasional evidence of strikes and occasional illustration of the regard in which a master printer was held  instances of the employment of slaves have been noted for the british islands  slave labor was also used by the dutch in surinam but of the wage rates and working conditions of free labor hardly any information has been found the wages of personnel in the government printing office at scarboro tobago in  show that the foreman received fifty pounds per year the two compositors fifteen and twelve pounds respectively and the apprentice but ten shillings a month this was at a time when the economic state of tobago was at its worst and it would be unwise to draw general conclusions from these pay scales the places of printing many west indian islands are too small for printing to have been worth attempting outside the capital the needs of barbados for instance could very easily be served from bridgetown only in a few colonies therefore did printing spread outside the capital admittedly guadeloupe had printers in both basseterre and in point apitre and martinique in st pierre and fort de france and in trinidad a printer set up in san fernando as early as  but in the eighteenth century only two islands had several centers of printing both jamaica and the french colony of st domingue were large enough for there to be commercial centers too remote from the capitals for easy communication and large enough to provide printers with a local market for a local paper in st domingue the two chief centers of printing were cap frangais and port au prince but at times presses operated from st marc leogane and aux cayes also during the reign of emperor christophe in independent haiti a royal printing office was also set up in his palace sans souci  in the spanish part of the island the dominican republic it is worth noting that as well as the purely dominican papers issued in santo domingo there was a weeklyjournal  for example a compositors strike at the montego bayjamaica standard in january  there was a printers general strike in jamaica in  broken by the daily gleaner by installing linotypes imported from new york the luckless compositors most of whom came from barbados and trinidad were forced to return to their native islands to seek employment  in antigua in february  when frederick s jewett retired from the direction of the antigua observer a letter of regret signed by all the printing house staff the foreman four journeymen plus five occasional workmen was published in the paper such tributes are rare
 the library quarterly of commerce issued by a bahamian printer in the north coast town of puerto plata in the late  s in jamaica printing spread from kingston and spanish town to montego bay in  and to savanna la mar in  though this last venture soon failed the introduction of printing into the north coast town of falmouth in  was much more successful despite its proximity to montego bay printing spread slowly to other towns in jamaica to old harbour in  to port maria about  and to port antonio later in the nineteenth century  with improved internal communications in the island only kingston and montego bay remain of significance as printing centers today to locate the whereabouts of the printing houses in these various towns is not always easy although most of the colonial towns were laid out on a grid many were far too small to make it necessary for the printers imprints to specify their location and when they did it was often in terms which retrospectively are valuelessclose by the courthouse on the parade in the house formerly occupied by dr baker in the cases of port of spain and kingston the most important printing centers by the mid nineteenth century the information gleaned suggests that there was no special center for the printing trade in the first whereas in kingston harbour street had become the normal place for a printer to set up with the bookshops and subscription libraries in king street the fashionable shopping area not until the suburban dispersal of kingston after world war ii did harbour street lose its special position in the trade printers equipment until the late eighteenth century printing facilities in the west indies were limited to letterpress printing when copperplate printing was required for example for various engraved views of planters houses or for mapslocal advertising always emphasized that the plates would be printed in europe the inventory of robert baldwin business  was not untypical nor was it very different from similar inventories of printers in north america or the english provinces paper was occasionally obtained from the american colonies in the early days but after  importation direct from europe was universal in the late  since this paper is concerned with the printing trade i have left out reference to st ann bay in which the reverend george wilson bridges had a private press in the s   william daniell of kingston purchased paper from benjamin franklin in   pp    franklin also supplied printers in antigua and barbados

 the library quarterly having quarreled with the printers of both the colony papers tried to bypass them by having official proclamations produced on a little lithographic press imported for the purpose and published them in the old way of posting them as handbills about the streets of hamilton the newspapers editorial comment as can be imagined did little to reconcile the governor to them  pp   there was some amateur lithographic work in st ann bay jamaica later in the s  by the s isaac mendes belisario of kingston was producing some very accomplished work notably in his splendid sketches of character    of the negro population in the island of jamaica which was issued in three parts   public support for belisario work however was disappointing some primitive wood engraved work was produced in kingston in the s to illustrate various agricultural works but little sophisticated wood engraving seems to have been executed in the islands one notable exception was in port of spain where in  the short lived satirical magazine pixy contained some vigorous and competently engraved cartoons pixy advertising incidentally included telephone numbers  remarkably early for the caribbean the standards of workmanship of the west indian printers varied widely in general the bookwork of the eighteenth century was of very good quality and some of the more prestigious items such as peter pindar persian love elegies kingston joseph thompson  co  or alexander dirom thoughts on the state of the militia ofjamaica spanish town douglass  aikman  are very attractively produced some of the more ephemeral items the almanacs produced by printers in the french islands or in st kitts several of the newspapers show the hands of accomplished craftsmen of some taste others show deplorable composition and presswork the aikmans for example were extremely slovenly in the production of their royal gazette although their almanacs and bookwork were well done in general the declining economic position of the west indian colonies in the second half of the nineteenth century was reflected in the printing worn out types badly set and printed without skill on defective presses by uncaring printers this is to overstate the position since competent work continued to appear but one can produce many examples of such slovenliness perhaps the worst was the trinidad recorder whose final issue of june   was of strange appearance the publishers of the ecorder beg to be excused for issuing the paper without the first and fourth pages upon going to press the forme burst and both pages went to pi they also take this opportunity of thanking their many friends for past patronage and to inform them that it being impossible to continue under existing circumstance the present issue closes the career of the rinidad recorder 
printing and book trade in the west indies  the publications of the west indian printers newspapers almost without exception printers in the west indian colonies depended for their survival upon the production of a regular newspaper the earliest were weeklies in the more populous colonies papers appearing twice or thrice weekly or daily had emerged before the end of the eighteenth century though in the smaller settlements it was a struggle to keep even a weekly paper alive the typical paper before the mid nineteenth century when machine made papers and powered presses led to a larger format was a demy folio with three or four columns to the page page  would contain proclamations and other official advertisements plus world news culled from european and north american papers which generally spilled over onto page  page  would contain local news plus matter lifted from other west indian papers and often a substantial number of advertisements which usually occupied the whole of the fourth page if their matter stretched beyond a single sheet many of the proprietors issued regular supplements with their papers the aikmans royal gazette of  quarto pages for example usually had another  pages of supplement and  pages of postscript while a further  or  pages of additional postscript were not uncommon this was to accommodate the hosts of official advertisements required by jamaican law of pound sales of runaway slaves lodged in the parish workhouses and so forth which made printing such a lucrative business for those running the semiofficial papers few other papers were quite as prolific in their provision of addenda but most published occasional supplements or extraordinary issues from time to time to report the british victory at waterloo or the results of a british parliamentary election and so forth in several instances when the departure of the mail vessels from a particular island did not coincide with regular publication a special packet edition of the paper was published most newspaper proprietors aimed at the production of a long lived paper of course very occasionally in response to local political stimuli however papers sprang up to play their part in the discussion of that single issue and then died the federation riots of  in barbados which marked a stormy episode in the tumultuous colonial career of john pope hennessy  pp   were accompanied by a host of  some proprietors like the aikmans with their royal gazette preferred a quarto format  sometimes from further afield for example india though i suspect most was taken at second hand from english papers and not directly from the indian press

printing and book trade in the west indies  all persons are cautioned against purchasing papers of the lad frederick who usually delivers them to the town subscribers there is reason to believe that papers are frequently purchased in this way at a reduced price the practice is dishonourable in the extreme those who would thus encourage a young lad in a dishonest act deserve the severest punishment of the law as they must know he is not authorised to dispose of them and they may rest assured that if once detected a proper example will be made of them how many copies of the papers circulated is very hard to judge as information on this is seldom to be found the jamaica despatch whose success was regarded with awe by other newspaper proprietors in the s was said to circulate some  copies in  thirty years earlier the barbados mercury had some  subscribers probably much nearer the normal circulation figure for a successful paper in a prosperous and populous colony but in the smaller islands the situation was very different the report of st bartholomew had forty three subscribers in  the grenada weekly record estimated in  that not one of the three bahamian newspapers had as many as  subscribers when the tobago chronicle ceased publication in august  the editor referred to his twenty five or thirty subscribersnot all of whom were paid up when one reads in the st christopher advertiser in september  that the intending promoters of a newspaper in tortola in the british virgin islands had abandoned the project for lack of support one wonders whether their tentative subscription list had even reached double figures periodicals in several colonies attempts were made from time to time to issue monthly or quarterly magazines in jamaica in particular there were several such attempts from the s onward some like the cornwall magazine or temple of pleasure issued from savanna la mar by monk  leyburn in  were doomed from the start but others like william smart columbia magazine or monthly miscellany kingston  or the jamaica magazine kingston  were competently produced and edited and contain much interesting and important matter but they like the magazines which appeared in grenada and barbados failed for lack of support henry breen comments on the barbados west india magazine sum up the typical expatriate attitude the scant support given to the west india magazine    has been referred to as  out of a total population of some  in the colony in which there was no rival paper some indication of the parlous state of the island economy  characteristic traits of the creolian  african negroes in jamaica c c  edited by barry higman mona caldwell press  reprints some valuable material from the columbian magazine
 the library quarterly evidence of a want of disposition to encourage a taste for polite literature upon the whole however it would hardly be fair to admit this test the magazine possessed the natural advantage of local interest on many colonial topics but independently of the inartistic style in which it was got up it gave very little promise in a literary point of view its pages being generally characterised by bombast triviality ad grammar as the editor used to term it and worse taste      pp   official printing equally important as their newspapers for many west indian printers were the contracts to be gained for official printing proclamations editions of a colony laws votes of the houses of assembly this was the kind of work which could put a printer into easy circumstances much official work could of course be published through the medium of a newspaper from time to time individual colonies attempted to force their contractors to issue an official gazette distinct from their own newspaper but such attempts seldom lasted long in jamaica all official advertisements had to appear in the three county papers the royal gazette kingston the st jago de la vega gazette spanish town and the cornwall chronicle montego bay at any rate until the s other printers secured contractual positions as printer to the corporation of kingston or even as printer to the parish of hanover such was the competition for official contract business in the colony in other islands official work was generally farmed out to a single printer for the whole island and there was much jobbery to secure the position frequently newspapers which did not have these contracts nevertheless included much official matter to improve the usefulness of their paper to subscribers and in the hope of securing official approval against the day their rivals fell from favor ephemera so little ephemera from west indian printers survives and is easily accessible that it is easy to forget the enormous importance its production had for the colonial printer but from robert baldwin onward all west indian printers advertised a range of blank pro formasattorneys blanks bills of lading seamen articles articles of administration muster rolls for the militia letters of marque for privateers and so forth in addition of course there were innumerable official formscertificates that vessels had checked with the appropriate port authorities blanks for letters of administration etcthe production of  bradford s swan identified some antiguan ephemera in the rhode island archives  and much must survive in other record repositories
