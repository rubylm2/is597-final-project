f r om th e e d i t o r saftermath part  despite the way it may seem all is not lost for libraries and librarianship paul t jaeger ursula gorham natalie g taylor lindsay c sarin and karen kettnichhis is the second of two special issues that library quarterly has devoted to the im t plications of the political events of the  presidential campaign in the united statesthe outcome of the election and the subsequent policy and political events for libraries and other cultural heritage institutions much of what falls into these categories of course is bad news for libraries librarians and those who rely on libraries the national and local political scene over the past  years has been extremely disheartening for many people in the library profession this is not really news but it is something that we have to articulate clearly to start mapping out what we do in response from the perspective of our profession and institutions the negative pressures are found in interrelated and concurrent strands in the political discourse first the  presidential campaign was defined by language that ostracized and dehumanized many of the disadvantaged or marginalized populationsracial ethnic and religious minorities lgbtq folks immigrants and refugees people with disabilities non english speakers people living in povertythat libraries have long sought to include in their local communities and in society as a whole and as a profession with a distinguished history of providing career opportunities to women long before most other fields did the prominent antifeminist antiwoman or at least antinasty woman rhetoric of the campaign provides an especially powerful sting second such language has been turned into action by the new presidential administration and resulted in among other things a spike in hate crimes against many of these groups that we work to better integrate into the communities that we serve and the presidents proposed budget which slashes funding for many social services and institutions central to the lives of many library patrons including education and literacy programs scientific research and even health care and disease prevention achenbach and sun  davidson  snell paletta and debonis  strauss a b third many key principles around which we have built our fieldfreedom of expression equitable access to information the provision of reliable resourceshave been equally batteredlibrary quarterly information community policy vol  no  pp    by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
  the library quarterlyby the  presidential campaign and what has followed the election as institutions devoted to increasing the knowledge literacy and self empowerment of our community members with information libraries are in a strange place in a world of alternative facts fake news and the splendid isolation of people seeking only opinions and facts that they already agree with those posters from the american library association that just say read suddenly seem like profound political stances the political discourse has rapidly come to devalue many whom we serve and much of what we do this devaluation fits perfectly with the overall political philosophy of the last  years of american politics since the dawn of the reagan administration many political leaders have advocated for cutting support for institutions and programs that serve the public good buschman   jaeger taylor and gorham  known as neoliberal economic doctrine this way of viewing public services has led to decades of decreases in support for libraries and many other services in recent years this view has become heavily tied to the nonsensical claim that libraries are no longer needed because of google these three strands are totally intertwined and their impacts over the next few years at least feel almost predestined the people who count on our institutions will need greater support from them and probably in many new ways that we are not yet able to imagine the political climate will become increasingly negative toward libraries and the values they promote and finances will become much further constrained each strand will feed the others squeezing libraries more and more in short we are institutions of the public good that promote education literacy expression rights justice and equity but virtually every noun in the first clause of this sentence is now considered a political liability this situation can easily inspire a sense of helplessness or even pointlessness the libraries are doomed so we just hope that the effects of global warming wipe us out before we have to close our doors due to lack of funds right no definitely no feeling sorry for ourselves is not a luxury that we have our patrons need us and our country needs us we have a great deal to be proud of in the history of our profession and in the present of our profession from those past and current achievements there is a clear vision of what we can do now and in the future to fight for the values of our profession and the needs of our communities about  years ago the authors of this article began writing a series of publications on the sociopolitical climate influencing libraries the significant social and political impacts of libraries and the ways in which libraries can better articulate and demonstrate their value and contributions in the political environment eg jaeger et al   jaeger and sarin  through the research for these publications we developed a strong sense of the arc of the professions activism and engagement for well over a century libraries and librarians have been uniquely adept at turning awful situations into chances for innovation consider a few examples
from the editors   when waves of immigrants from regions of the world that had not previously made up a large portion of the us population began to flood major cities around the years of the first world war libraries invented myriad ways to help these new populations become integrated innovations of that era such as literacy classes childrens story time and job seeking materials and instruction are still fundamental to what we do today and as a bonus our institutions around that time were also among the first in many metropolitan areas to adopt new technologies and procedures that made library buildings cleaner and healthier than most other public buildings  the great depression in the s sent library usage escalating as library budgets dwindled the demand for both library books and reference services skyrocketed between  and  circulation at libraries around the country jumped by  to  annually although those averages were down to  by  as libraries had fewer intact materials left for patrons to borrow yet despite the lack of intact materials and too little funding to hire new staff libraries found a way to expand services for unemployed adults and children in need  when censorship was widely supported by the public from comstock laws to mccarthyism we stood against censorship in what people could read in our collections and more broadly in society we made opposition to censorship the central principle of the library bill of rights in  we won the battle for public perception censorship although making a comeback in certain quarters is clearly antithetical to democracy for the majority of the public  when the george w bush administration implemented a series of laws and policies after  that were intended to greatly increase the ability of the government to monitor the reading habits of people and to collect information from libraries we found many creativeand often ingeniously subtleways to protect the privacy of our patrons while bringing national attention to the issue the cover of library journal asked who wants to be the first to go jail in response to the usa patriot act then president of the american library association and now librarian of congress carla hayden directly engaged attorney general john ashcroft on these issues ashcroft weirdly called librarians hysterical in response flip flopping on the extent to which the law was being used in libraries as he tried to discredit the efforts of libraries to raise awareness about the impacts of the law  during the great recession that began  years ago libraries were once again seeing unprecedented usage at a time when budgets were dropping sometimes precipitously and as during the great depression libraries found ways to create services that met new needs emphasizing programs and services to promote job seeking and local economic development to provide greater connections to government services and to ensure internet access and resources for those who could no longer afford them
  the library quarterlythese specific examples are only part of the larger mosaic of actions by our institutions that have led the fight against injustices our field has been far ahead of most of the rest of the nation in embracing and advocating forand opening our own professional ranks to not just women but also members of the lgbtq community people with disabilities and people of color not every library has been on the right side of every issue as fast as we may wish they had but overall we have probably done better than any other profession in consistently maintaining focus on making society more inclusive and individual lives more equitable for example just think about a public library at this moment much of the space and programming are devoted to free computer and internet access digital literacy courses and oneon one assistance job search and application training and help with navigating government forms and obtaining social services among other activities there are books dvds cds and much else to loan out but people are more often in the public library to improve their own lives much of the current role of public libraries is ensuring that community members have the equitable chance to get basic services to become educated to become employed to be civically engaged and to communicate effectively all of which are human rights a similar summary of contributions could be readily constructed for a typical academic library or a typical school library or a typical public law library or any other kind of library you can namewhat we contribute in a time of extraordinary need or political crisis libraries evolve and innovate and endure that is where we are now with all these current political challenges we can focus on doing what libraries do best adapting and leading through service to meet the changing needs of our communities and individual patrons and if that sounds overwhelming or too abstract then it might help to think about what each of us can do in terms of a few key verbs that define our institutions and our professionbelong libraries belong to their communities but they also are a key part of the community sustaining itself the library is central to the community that it serves whether that community is the students attending a particular school the people living in a certain geographic area the groups of people affiliated with a college or the researchers investigating a specific topic a strong library is indelibly etched into the life and activities of its community a place that community members take for granted because it is so good at what it does even a cursory glance at the history of libraries reveals that they brilliantly adapt to the changing needs of their communities whatever that means the internet has significantly shifted the focus of libraries collections for example but this change has vastly expanded the re
from the editors  sources available to communities and their connectivity to other parts of the world through such adaptations libraries are important in helping communities to grow and members of those communities to have a sense of community and belonging with the significant challenges that many populations are now facing in the overall social and political climate a sense of community and a sense of belonging will be more essential than ever for many people served by libraries provide essentially libraries provide what their specific local communities need from them in addition to the activities of a typical public library every public library also responds to very specific local needs there are public libraries in the united states providing community health nursing drug counseling services social work services the ability to order and pick up groceries tool libraries cake pan libraries a safe place during moments of strife and civil unrest and countless other programs and services that meet a specific local need that perhaps no other institution is trying to address and again every other type of library could generate a similarly diverse and impressive list of general and local contributions to communities each library provides education space services shelter programs outreach and so many other contributions to its community that a full list would be overwhelming providing what communities and community members need will be increasingly important as the neoliberal economic doctrine embraced by so many political leaders at national state and local levels leaves fewer and fewer other social services and public goods availablecreate a key part of providing what communities need is creating innovative educational services before many members of the community even realize that such services are needed establishing maker spaces to promote learning in science technology mathematics robotics and engineering is a very recent example of libraries making a new educational contribution to their communities across the history of the field many of the core components of what our institutions do began as creative programs that had never been tried before the aforementioned childrens story hour is a good example of an innovation that has flourished libraries also create opportunities for community members through practical skills programsteaching technology literacy and searching skills resume writing and job searching and navigation of e government resources and applications among much else these skills create new opportunities for the community members who learn from such programs both types of creation result in a more educated community and these educational opportunities will be particularly important as other social supports and publicly available educational opportunities dwindle
  the library quarterlyengage libraries engage their communities in many valuable ways reaching out to community members taking library services to unique spaces and cultivating relationships these functions are all extremely important but more ambitious engagementtalking about the good the library does for the community as frequently and widely as possibleis increasingly important we do many great things that people who do not use the library already are unaware of as we pick up more responsibilities and generate new ways to contribute the need to advocate for ourselves only increases engage local politicians and civic leaders local media and members of the community who are not regular library users to let them know about all of the irreplaceable contributions you make and all that would be lost to the community if your funding were reduced people need to understand why google will never be able to replace a library too often because of our fields resistance to advocacy we hurt our institutions and our profession by not being louder and prouder about our accomplishments if your local government is cutting public funding failing to advocate for the library can have serious consequences for the library the staff and all of the community members who rely them we have amazing stories to tell we just need be brave enough to tell them these are the primary reasons that the word library is so powerful both to those who rely on libraries and to those who wish to defund them libraries and other cultural heritage institutions are uniquely capable of empowering individuals and entire communities promoting equity and justice in ways that few other institutions can in this issue all of these conceptsbelong provide create and engageare reflected in the various essays and articles that compose the second part of aftermath libraries democracy and the  presidential election this issue opens with dear students becoming an archivist in a time of uncertainty and unrest a personal reflection by ricardo l punzalan on the interconnections of archives political issues and professional practice the impacts of the  election on lis education and educators are further explored in on responsibility in the classroom and the ubiquity of politics postelection reflections from the united states and canada by keren dali and debbie rabina and we will not be silent amplifying marginalized voices in lis education and research by sandra hughes hassell and amelia gibson as these three articles reveal preparing current lis students to be engaged and forwardthinking information professionals is acutely important at this time similarly it is incumbent on those already in the field to respond to changes wrought by the new political environment the importance of teaching information literacy for example has received more attention because of growing concern about fake news ray pun in hacking the research library wiki
from the editors  pedia trump and information literacy in the escape room describes an instructional program at fresno state university that uses gamification to help students build information literacy skills and in yes we still can promoting equity and inclusion in childrens and young adult library services renee f hill offers guidance on helping young patrons become engaged with issues of diversity inclusion equity politics and social justice however the ability of libraries to help their patrons navigate a complex and shifting information landscape may be affected by changes in funding as discussed by john chrastka in what a renewed federalism means for libraries paul t jaeger erin zerhusen urusula gorham renee f hill and natalie greene taylor in waking up to advocacy in a new political reality for libraries also examine changes in library funding and related policy developments arguing that advocacy efforts at local and state levels are becoming increasingly important notwithstanding the challenges facing libraries of all kinds our professions potential to contribute to democratic discourse has never been clearer as explored in mobilization of rural libraries toward political and economic change in the aftermath of the  presidential election by bharat mehra negotiating borders librarianship and twenty first century politics by nadia caidi j j ghadar and danielle allard creating space at the table intellectual freedom can bolster marginalized voices by shannon oltmann and libraries reuniting the divided states of america by nancy kranich together the perspectives and ideas presented in this issueand their underlying messages of hope and resiliencehighlight how so many in our field have used the turmoil and uncertainty of the past few months as an impetus to belong to provide to create and to engage facing tomorrow building a library and being a librarian are emphatic statements of a firm belief in helping and improving the community our institutions and our profession are inherently hopeful we would not chose this line of work unless we believed that we were committed to promoting education inclusion social services public spaces digital literacy social justice and human rights while meeting many other community needs as a part of our regular work these community focused values will serve us well as we navigate the next few years we have faced many large challenges before and if we stay focused on what we can do best and the people who need us to do our best we will be able to scale whatever mountains are just ahead so all is not lost the changes and challenges may be long lasting and impactful but libraries and other cultural heritage institutions are longer lasting and more impactful many important innovations will flow from these years of difficulty as we rise to meet the expanded and new needs that result from this political and policy environment we have much to do and this issueand its predecessoroffer a bounty of ideas for working with the realities of now
