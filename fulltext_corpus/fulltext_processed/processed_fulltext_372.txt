introduction the continued underrepresentation of ethnic minorities in the lis library and information science field has raised concerns among lis educators and professionals for decades   statistics have consistently shown that the student population in lis schoolsprograms is less diverse than the us population while  percent of the students enrolled in ala american library association accredited lis programs are white only  percent are students of color from the four main ethnic minority groups african american asian american hispanic american and native american  the proportion of students of color in lis schools  percent is significantly lower than the proportion of those enrolled in all us masters programs  percent  and much lower than the proportion of ethnic minorities in the us population  percent  such underrepresentation is also evident in libraries an ala report indicates that librarians of color constitute about  percent of the academic and public librarian population  more recently it has been reported that the ratio of librarians of color in the credentialed librarian population has actually dropped to  percent in  from  percent in   with the closing of the lis school at clark atlanta universitya historically black universityin  there have been growing concerns that recruiting minorities into the lis field would become even more difficult other professional fields also face the same challengeunderrepresentation of ethnic minorities in their profession in social work journalism and nursing minorities constitute around  percent of their professional population  such fields have made great efforts to recruit more minorities into their professions and some have been fairly successful for example the ratio of ethnic minorities in the elementary and secondary school teacher population has risen to  percent in  from  percent in   the us census projections indicate that by  the four ethnic minority groups will represent almost half of the us population  unless a comprehensive and competitive plan for recruitingretaining ethnic minorities is implemented the lis field will fall behind other fields and the gap between lis and us populations will widen even further the librarian population will not reflect the users in the communities that they serve  one of the most important ways to minimize such a gap would be to implement more effective programs to recruitretain students of color in lis schools it has long been recognized that attracting diverse students into lis programs is key to producing a diverse workforce in librarianship  nevertheless recruitmentretention in lis schools has received much less attention than recruitmentretention in libraries this study is an effort to identify effective strategies for recruiting and retaining students of color in lis education programs a nationwide webbased survey was conducted to examine how librarians of color evaluate the minority recruitmentretention efforts that lis schools and associations have made and what recruitmentretention strategies the librarians consider effective the study tried to identify effective strategies from the perspective of librarians of color as the librarians were actually the target of such recruitment and retention endeavors importance of ethnic diversity and need for diversity in professions the benefits of ethnic diversity in the lis field are multifold it benefits library users library organizations and lis programs to users having authority figures who look like them in libraries is important as it can make the users feel more comfortable and affirmed that they are in the right place studies suggest that interpersonal similarity increases ease of communication fosters relationships of trust and reciprocity and helps establish a sense of belonging and membership   ethnicity one of the key factors determining interpersonal similarities contributes to cultural as well as physical similarities in a library with an ethnically diverse workforce all the users regardless of their ethnic and cultural background will be able to find someone whom they can relate to and get services relevant to their needs and preferences with a better understanding of cultural values languages and information needs of the minority community librarians of color can provide effective reference  information literacy  and collection management services  and also reach out to diverse users  as mark winston   accurately pointed out diversity in libraries is important not only for the provision of better information services but also for the better performance and success of libraries a number of studies suggest that companies that are diverse in minority employment and other aspects tend to perform better and be more successful than others   diversity in librarianship should be one of the key factors affecting the success of libraries as a positive relationship exists between the level of diversity and organizational performance ethnic diversity also brings benefits to schools improving the quality of learning   researchers have found that diversity in higher education can foster intellectual development  reduce students level of racial prejudice  and facilitate students explorations of diverse perspectives  overall ethnic diversity is beneficial as it enriches a society by offering all citizens including students more opportunities to experience learn and understand one another efforts to improve ethnic diversity recognizing the benefits of and the needs for a diverse workforce in librarianship many lisrelated organizations have worked diligently to recruit people of color into the professions over the last few decades ala for example created the spectrum initiative in  in order to promote diversity in the library community and recruit minority librarians by providing scholarships mentoring and training programs a number of lis schools as well as libraries have shown their support of the spectrum initiative scholarship program by matching or supplementing the grants  the arl association of research libraries another prominent professional association sponsors the leadership and career development program for minority librarians who have demonstrated leadership in research libraries it also launched the initiative to recruit a diverse workforce to recruit lis graduate students of color to arl libraries upon graduation  other associations including the medical library association the special library association the library administration and management association and the library and information technology association also provide similar support lis schools also have made an effort to increase the number of students of color through scholarships grantsupported recruitment programs regional recruitment projects and curriculum reform  especially with support from the institute of museum and library services an increasing number of lis schools offer recruitment programs often accompanied by scholarships and special programs knowledge river at the university of arizona  prism at the university of rhode island and praxis practice reflection advocacy excellence inquiry solutions at the university of california los angeles are some examples many academic libraries also offer residency internship and fellowship programs for recruiting underrepresented groups in the lis field such programs have been well received and an increasing number of libraries provide similar opportunities  despite such endeavors however the progress in recruiting students of color in lis has been rather slow empirical research might help identify effective recruitment and retention strategies and develop more efficient and systematic recruitment and retention programs investigating approaches used in other professional fields might also offer some insight on successful strategies precollege bridge programs used for recruiting minorities in engineering and nursing  partnerships among research universities colleges and community colleges used for developing systematic recruitment programs in psychology   and early intervention programs and nationwide campaigns used for improving the publics image of the professions in nursing and other health care fields   are some examples for a successful recruitment and retention of minorities the lis field will need to be vigilant in researching and implementing effective strategies research on recruitment and retention effective recruitmentretention programs cannot be developed without the support of research a review of the related literature in lis has revealed that a majority of recruitment research focuses on the factors affecting individuals decisions to enter the lis profession examples of such research include kathleen heim and william moens study on occupational entry  lois buttlar and william caynons survey of librarians of color  and winstons recruitment theory research  these studies identified factors and people with a strong impact on a persons decision to enter the lis field some of the influential factors include the intellectual and serviceoriented characteristics of librarianship role models eg librarians and teachers previous library work experience and availability of financial aid      other studies focus on barriers to the minority recruitment in lis some of the identified obstacles are related to the library profession itself for example low salary of librarians is a barrier working against recruiting potential students to the lis field statistics show that professional fields with higher salary levels eg lawyers and engineers are more successful in recruiting minorities  percent of legal and engineering student populations are ethnic minorities   the negative image of librarians is another obstacle related to the profession  other barriers include racism  and a lack of diversity in lis programs and libraries  another group of studies focuses on strategies for effective recruitment and retention the strategies and related studies are presented in table  the first seven strategies would be effective for both recruitment and retention collaboration with libraries for example can be an effective recruitment strategy in a number of existing studies most of the lis students or librarians of color reported that they had previous library work experience before pursuing lis studies and that librarians influenced them to choose the lis field    libraries provide an important pool of prospective lis students and librarians could be great role models and recruiters working with libraries would also be a part of retention efforts as the librarians can help incorporate diversity in curriculum eg through their participation in lis education as guest speakers or lecturers and as supervisors or collaborators for fieldwork and internship and also mentor current students creative delivery of classes would be another effective strategy for both recruitment and retention it can be realized in different ways including flexible class times eg evening and weekend courses and distance education options such options can help students keep their jobs to support their studies financially table  recruitment and retention strategies in lis strategies studies financial aid

recruitment the use of personal contacts aggressive advertisement of the profession and lis programs and targeted recruitment are also frequently suggested targeted recruitment is related to the use of strategies effective to a particular ethnic minority group which requires a good understanding of the group strategies of this kind may include advertising in ethnic yellow pages recruiting trips to historically black institutions bilingual advising and so on  incorporating diversity in curriculum and offering internshipfieldwork opportunities in ethnic minority communities would be important for retaining students of color to effectively incorporate diversity in teaching scenarios or case studies on diversity issues can be used in most classes  and ethnic minority guest speakers or lecturers can be invited  having students work in diverse communities and serve diverse users through fieldwork internships or practicums would be another excellent strategy to help all lis students appreciate the importance of diversity after understanding influential factors and strategies for recruitment and retention an important step to follow would be to assess the effectiveness of strategies as recruitmentretention efforts take resources that are usually limited it is essential to identify more effective strategies and allocate resources accordingly empirical research is instrumental in identifying the more effective strategies from an array of potential strategies buttlar and caynons study in  is one of the few empirical studies that touched upon the issue of recruiting strategies in lis librarians of color participated in the study and the study findings helped identify effective recruitment strategies the lis field and society have undergone significant changes since the study over a decade ago the present study seeks to understand current views of librarians of color with regard to effective strategies for recruiting and retaining students of color in lis programs study the goal of the study was twofold  to assess the efforts that lis schools and associations have made to recruit and retain students of color and  to identify effective recruitmentretention strategies which will help develop efficient recruitmentretention programs the study also aimed at revealing any differences among different ethnic minority groups in terms of recruitment and retention strategies they consider effective participants the study participants were librarians of color who graduated from an alaaccredited lis program or are currently enrolled in such a program because these individuals were the target of the recruitmentretention efforts of lis schools and associations their experiences and suggestions regarding minority recruitmentretention would provide valuable information on the strategies that will work effectively the selection of this population was also guided by the recruitment theory as elaborated by winston the premise of this theory is that there are similarities between those who are currently in a field or profession and those who are likely to enter it  a study of librarians of colorformer students in lis programswould provide insights into characteristics and preferences of the prospective students of color in lis programs as the two groups must be similar according to the recruitment theory a total of  librarians

  some of the respondents did not provide information on their ethnic background when the lists of influential factors by different ethnic groups were compared previous library work experience and academic and public librarians were always among the top five interestingly school librarians were more influential in african american and hispanic groups than in others school librarians were ranked fifth by both groups discussion the success of a program can be evaluated in different ways and client satisfaction is an important way to measure it the study findings that were related to the satisfaction of participants the target clients of recruitmentretention programs in the past seem to suggest that these efforts have not been very successful the participants tended to be rather dissatisfied especially with the retention efforts in the openended question section several respondents indicated that they felt forgotten and abandoned once they were recruited and began their studies in lis schoolsprograms it is already difficult to recruit students of color into the lis field and we cannot afford to lose them once they are in our programs lis schools need to make sure not only to recruit new students of color but also to support and help the current students to be successful in their lis program one of the noteworthy findings was the rather consistent dissatisfaction expressed by the hispanic group especially with retention efforts recent us population statistics provide useful information that can help us understand why the us census data  indicate that hispanics are one of the most rapidly growing populations in the united states hispanics constituted  percent of the us population in  and they are projected to be  percent by  and  percent by  by  hispanics will become the largest among the four minority groups in lis schools however hispanics constituted only  percent of the lis student population in   and  percent in  about a tenpoint gap between the lis and us populations more aggressive recruitment and retention plans are urgently needed for minorities and hispanics in particular regarding recruitment several effective strategies were identified the top ten recruitment strategies can be divided into three groups  financial support and workcareer opportunity  diversity in facultystaff and studentsalumni and  active recruitment including advertisement and personal contacts the first group consists of four strategies  assistantshipscholarshipfinancial aid  opportunities to work in lisrelated fields  special programs opportunities to work with lis faculty graduate students or librarians and  availability of career servicesjob placement in the lis schoolprogram for most students it is important that they can support themselves financially and find a job upon graduation if lis programs can provide students with these eg offering scholarshipsfinancial aid or parttime work opportunities and providing career servicejob placement such programs will be more successful in recruiting students of color this finding is consistent with extant studies that highlight the importance of financial aid in recruitment and retention    it was interesting to find that offering special programs to support collaboration between students of color and lis facultystudents was among the frequently suggested strategies in this study this kind of program can achieve several objectives at the same time through such programs students can learn what the lis field is about they can also meet with some authoritative figures who can be their role models as well as mentors furthermore the entire experience would be rewarding intellectually as well as financially it would be worthwhile if lis schoolsprograms were to consider offering such special programs other important strategies are related to diversity these include another four strategies  ethnic diversity of faculty in the lis schoolprogram  role models from ethnic groups  presence of faculty and staff of color in the recruitment process and  presence of alumni of color in the recruitment process role models or authoritative figures of color are found to be especially crucial in recruiting minority students   if students see role models or authoritative figures from ethnic minority groups in everyday life and also during the recruitment process they would be able to relate themselves more easily to the model figures and the field in which they work the students would also feel more confident about their success in the field underscoring the importance of role models one of the participants wrote i once had a little girl tell me that she wanted to be a librarian i wonder if she would have said that had i not been there to show her that little african american girls can grow up to be librarians in order to have more diverse role models of course we will need to produce and hire more librarians and faculty of color finally the importance of active recruitment cannot be overemphasized two strategies are related to active recruitment  communicationadvertising in media and publications for people of color and  active solicitation and personal contacts from the lis schoolprogram a number of participants responded that they had seen no visible efforts made by their lis program for recruiting students of color obviously lis programs will need to be more active in advertising their programs to the target community and soliciting prospective students which has also been suggested in other studies   in addition as many participants suggested presenting lis programs in undergraduate classes and high schools should be implemented in general there was a consensus in terms of effective recruitment strategies however it should also be noted that some differences exist among ethnic groups in the strategies they view to be effective although these ethnic groups were often lumped together as the minority it is evident that they have different views and values and that they might prefer different recruitment and retention strategies  further research is called for in order to better understand each of the ethnic groups and to investigate strategies that would work best for each group for retention the top ten strategies can also be divided into three groups  financial support and workcareer opportunity  support by facultystaff students and ethnic associations and  curriculum and class schedule the first group consists of three strategies  assistantshipscholarshipfinancial aid  opportunities to work in lisrelated fields and  career servicesjob placement in the lis program financial support seems to be vital to both recruitment and retention    students need to pay for tuition and other related expenses which can be at least partially resolved through getting an assistantshipfinancial aid or holding a job by offering more financial support and work opportunities lis programs can help students stay in the program without worrying too much about financial issues to assist students in a job search lis programs will also need to provide effective careerjob placement services the second group is related to support for students of color and consists of five strategies  faculty and staff sensitive to the needs and concerns of students of color  mentoring programs in the lis schoolprogram  effective academic and career advising sensitive to the needs and concerns of students of color  partnerships between the lis program and ethnic associations and  support groupssystems in the lis program for students of color support by faculty staff peer students and other groups is critical to the success of any students in lis programs including students of color the faculty and staff members should try to be more sensitive to the views and needs of students of color and provide effective academic and career advising mentoring systems would be particularly important to students of color   being in the minority students of color can easily feel isolated and often suffer cultural loneliness  the lis program might consider training all of its members to better understand and appreciate different cultures fostering support groups and systems for minority students would also be helpful in addition it would be beneficial to have ethnic associations and communities involved in teaching and student activities such collaboration between lis programs and ethnic associations would provide more mentoring opportunities to students of color increase all students exposure to diversity issues and forge a closer relationship between the lis programs and different communities curriculum and class schedules are another area vital to retention and include two strategies  flexible class times and  curriculum incorporating diversitymulticulturalism as also suggested by others lis programs need to make a greater effort to incorporate diversity and multiculturalism into their curriculum  this can be done by offering courses dedicated to diversity and multiculturalism issues by incorporating these issues in all courses and by offering opportunities for students to work in diverse communities   when asked about major barriers in the recruitmentretention of students of color about  percent of the respondents said lack of institutional commitment and  percent said monocultural curriculum if lis schools demonstrate their commitment to diversity by supporting an atmosphere favorable to diversity and a curriculum incorporating multiculturalism students of color will feel more comfortable and appreciated in the program furthermore all the students will learn to appreciate other cultures and their values and be better prepared to work in an increasingly diverse society  it is crucial that lis programs take action to address these issues sooner rather than later a number of participants also suggested that flexible class times would be effective for retention of students this seems to have some connection with the financial issue as the amount of financial aid lis programs can offer is limited flexible class times would be helpful for those who need to work in order to support their studies or for those who are already working this observation seems to be supported by previous research kathleen de la peña mccook and william e moen discovered that financial assistance was the second most important reason among fulltime students for selecting lis schools while openness to working adults ie flexibility of scheduling and availability of advising was the second most important reason among parttime students  many lis schools already offer courses in evening hours or during the weekend in addition an increasing number of schools have online courses to accommodate these needs it should be noted however that the flexibility in class times is not just relevant to ethnic minority groups the lissada lis students attitudes demographics and aspirations survey showed that openness to the working adult eg flexible time schedule was among the top three factors for whites as well as other ethnic minority groups in their decision to choose an lis school to attend  when suggestions on the recruitmentretention strategies made by different ethnic groups were analyzed some significant differences were found among ethnic minority groups among native americans for example offering distance learning options in lis programs was ranked consistently higher than in other groups for both recruitment fifth and retention sixth it seems that native americans appreciate the opportunity to pursue studies without having to leave their home or community more than other ethnic groups this seems to be consistent with the findings of the lissada survey  only  percent of native american participants moved to a different state to attend lis programs which was the lowest rate among ethnic minority groups once effective recruitmentretention strategies are identified it is important to decide how to implement them first of all we must identify the target groups the study findings indicate that a number of participants decided to pursue lis studies while working in the lis field  percent paraprofessional librarians would be one of the most important target groups for recruitment which is consistent with the recommendation from others   paraprofessionals are also found to be an important target group in other professional fields including nursing and education    findings suggest that undergraduate  percent graduate  percent and high school students  percent are also potential target groups another important thing to find out is which groups can help lis schools recruit and retain students of color a majority of the respondents indicated that their previous library work experience and librarians influenced their decision to pursue studies in lis clearly librarians are the most important partner group for recruiting students of color    emphasizing the importance of librarians role in recruitment a participant wrote i have taken the time to take some of my staff members for a visit to my alma mater advisors there were expecting the visit and also took the time to explain some of the programs out of the three i have taken in the past years one is graduating   the other has taken three classes  the third one is finishing her bachelor degree  and has a clear idea on how to proceed about enrolling for her mls this underscores the importance of librarians as recruiters mentors and role models for students which has been echoed in other studies  it also confirms the effectiveness of personal contact as discussed earlier  lis schools need to work more closely with librarians to recruit and retain students libraries universities and ethnic minority organizations are considered to be important partners in the recruitmentretention of lis students libraries for example can promote and support cultural diversity through programming collection management and other information services they can also work with lis schools to organize information sessions career days or open houses and to provide students with work or internship opportunities  universities are another key partner in recruitment they can help lis programs in many ways such as advertising the lis programs promoting and supporting diversity providing scholarship funding and internship opportunities and offering career and mentoring services finally ethnic minority associations can help lis schools advertise lis programs in various ethnic communities reach out to minority communities through fieldwork internship or other work opportunities and mentor students conclusion the study findings helped reassess the efforts in recruiting and retaining students of color in lis programs the findings suggest that lis schools need to make a more balanced effort in the retention as well as the recruitment of students since ethnic diversity in lis can be achieved only when the recruitment of minority students is accompanied by their successful retention more support for retention efforts is called for the study also helped identify effective strategies for recruiting and retaining students of color while finding a general consensus with regard to the effectiveness of recruitment and retention strategies the study revealed differences among ethnic groups apart from implementing generally effective strategies more research is needed to better understand the preference and needs of different ethnic minority groups and to identify recruitmentretention strategies relevant to each group this kind of tailormade approach should be encouraged to address the uneven levels of underrepresentation among ethnic groups the demographics of our society are rapidly changing preparing lis education and the profession for this diverse society is one of the key concerns in the field this study shed light on some key areas of focus and potential improvement for recruitmentretention of students of color in lis programs a first step toward increasing diversity in lis education and the profession more empirical research will be needed to expand the understanding of different ethnic groups in terms of their unique as well as common experiences and preferences such research will help refine strategies for recruiting and retaining various ethnic groups a largescale survey based on probability sampling should also be conducted to increase the generalizability of the findings research surveying the views of faculty and administrators in lis schools and other partner organizations will be invaluable as it can uncover challenges and potential solutions from the organizational perspective recruiting and retaining a diverse population in lis education and the lis profession is an endeavor that requires careful planning and systematic efforts more research and empirical evidence on this topic is imperative to the success of this important endeavor
