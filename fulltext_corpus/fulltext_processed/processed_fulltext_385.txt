the library quarterly volume  january  number  women literary journals mary biggs this article reports findings of a questionnaire survey conducted in spring  of  literary magazines edited by and for women the information gained is discussed in the context of the little magazine movement as a whole women little magazines it is discovered share the independence of purpose the commitment to encouraging unknown writers the financial and publishing instability and the low circulation figures which typify the general run of little magazines however they differ in their group styles of editing their identification with feminism the preference they give to women as contributors and subjects and in their emphasizing of social goals over aesthetic concerns during the last decade increasing numbers of women have entered the predominantly masculine world of little magazine editors len fulton who runs dustbooks press and is coeditor and publisher of the standard directory in the field  has been one of the few men in that world to  this research was conducted in connection with a course taught by howard w winger at the university of chicago i am grateful to professor winger and also to w boyd rayward who reviewed an earlier version of this article and offered important suggestions for revision i am especially grateful to the editors of the  participating journals  university of chicago graduate library school  east th street chicago illinois  library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved

women literary journals  but with those limitations i identified  women oriented and edited literary magazines to each of these i sent a questionnaire which included questions concerning financial status and history circulation volume fund raising strategies size structure gender minority affiliations ages compensation length of service and methods of engaging editorial staff members selection criteria and procedures production processes general operating policies thematic preferences and aesthetic and political biases twenty six completed questionnaires were returned twenty four reporting on currently publishing journals and two on journals which had ceased publication see the appendix of these  journals  may have been chosen erroneously the first was dark horse which does not purposely project a women image however because its ten person editorial board was composed entirely of women and its selection policy specified nonsexism i decided to include dark horse in my study the second error concerns the now defunct country women although poetry sometimes appeared in its pages this journal stressed how to articles for self sufficient rural women responses from country women are used very selectively in this paper of the remaining twenty three questionnaires seventeen were returned as undeliverable or with a message that the journal had stopped publishing staff members on  additional journals indicated their intention to cooperate but finally did not due to lack of time one of these chrysalis ceased publication soon afterward only four mailings or  percent elicited no response at all in addition to conducting this survey i read as many issues as possible of each cooperating journal in several cases this amounted to the entire run in others to a few issues and in five cases to only one recent issue little magazines and women littles the same only different little magazines controlled by men and those created by and for women share the problems and opportunities of noncommercial publishing as well as some common assumptions and purposes most literary journals exist chiefly to provide exposure for worthy material which  i decided to exclude one magazine primavera  east th street chicago illinois because i serve on its editorial board  throughout this paper direct quotes not attributed to a source are drawn from completed questionnaires  the women collection held by the special collections department of the northwestern university library evanston illinois and administered by sarah sherman holds many though not all of these titles

 the library quarterly archetype of the elitist the carrier of the elitist spirit     p  against all of this engaging verbiage three significant implications take form  that most little magazines are strongly individualistic and are edited by one person or a small number of fairly autonomous people  that freedom is prized above all other values by little magazine editors and writers and  that while editors may claim literary aesthetics as their primary interest certain socialpolitical programs tend to occupy their minds and shape their choices while these implications seem true of the little magazines in general only the second holds for most women publications the first is antithetical to their philosophy and the third holds true only with a reversed emphasis most of my respondents said that their journals hew to feminism or at least antisexism even where consciously political matter is at a minimum work inspired by distinctively female experiences predominates this may not always be directly the result of editorial decisions for example sing heavenly muse would prefer more submissions dealing with sex neutral topics and viewed as women subjects anything women choose to write about however most other journals favored a focus on women and almost all valued a consciously female perspective this is of course a political preference which largely determines the nature of submissions and permeates all subsequent decisions asked if they had formulated a statement of purpose or policy  of the  journals answered in the affirmative and  of these included the statement only  dark horse and gilt edge new series did not indicate a preference for women writers women as subject matter or an intent to provide a communication network for women twenty two of the journals excluded men from editorial responsibilities as a matter of policy while  more did not but were in fact run entirely by women only bloodroot and syzygy had male editors one each but this seemed not to rule out feminism syzygy was published by the cincinnati women press a feminist project and expressed particular interest in literature portraying women while bloodroot staffers shared in varying degrees a feminist point of view both would consider submissions by men but gave preference to those by women indeed only  of the  journals claimed to consider men work equally with women and  of these carry oddly contradictory subtitles sibyl child a women arts and culturejournal and calyx a journal of art and literature by women calyx coeditor barbara baldwin acknowledged that most men are probably put off by the journal subtitle and she seemed untroubled by the misunderstanding we have never she observed received a piece by a man we were tempted to publish in her next paragraph she referred to calyx as a publication whose sole purpose for existence is to promote work by women  an additional  journals considered men submissions but favored those from women
women literary journals  and frequently imposed restrictions as to subject matter or viewpoint kalliope for example accepted only material related to women in the arts primipara considered men whose submissions come from their eminist side and sing heavenly muse welcomed the work of men who try to enter women experiences with intelligence and empathy  thirteen or half of the journals excluded men altogether some of these are emphatically feminist some are explicitly lesbian but some journals which maintain an all women policy resemble superficially any of the general literary magazines in all  respondents specified a feminist staff orientation but they varied greatly in the degree of political awareness they said they expect and would accept in literature although these variations are not always easy to perceive by reading their journals feminist theories of literature are many and diverse suggesting more serious conflicts than actually appear to exist for some of my respondents publication of women centered work is desirable simply to assure that it will be written and published and because it fulfills a personal need felt by them and presumably their readers for other editors publication of such work is viewed as a political act which will enhance women strength and solidarity the published work itself however might be the same therefore the artistic content of the apolitical or less political women journals can be and often is comparable in attitude with those which are politically radical the founding coeditors of sinister wisdom decided to publish their magazine because every genuinely feminist work of art is a blow at the heart of patriarchal reality  p  the women press collective has asserted bluntly our art has to do with reinforcing attitudes that we want women to have it a tool and that the way we use it  p  second wave which bears the subtitle a magazine of the new feminism claimed no political line but has stated that all accepted material must be related to the theme of women liberation  p  called itself a forum for non hierarchical anti capitalist feminist perspectives and excludes ersonal solution or reformist work many contemporary little magazine writers men as well as women join with these editors in regarding their own creative work poetry in particular as properly instigator herald and celebrant of political and social change in the end says charles allen the pervasive spirit of social protest which dominated so many little magazines may be seen to be their most significant contribution  p  although women have provided a fresh perspective on what james moore calls the links between poetry and politics  those links have been forged and tested by extraestablishment artists of all times beliefs and groups  see for example  p   
 the library quarterly however most of the  journals which acknowledged a bond with feminism also expressed in their statements of policy a resistance to didactic work calyx for example stated a dislike of political polemic masquerading as art this is consistent with the journals professed aesthetic concerns most spoke though rather vaguely of insistence on quality or professionalism only  expressed style preferences or any aesthetic biases of these   rather hazily specified a liking for modern or experimental work however none as a reading of the publications confirms exclude any style of expression and only  respondents reflected at all upon possible relationships between political and social purposes and literary style their generally nonprescriptive aesthetic attitudes and prescriptive social attitudes differentiate the journals in my study from most other little magazines it is clear however that women publications of all political stripes do seek literary quality phrases like artistic excellence high literary standards and creative integrity recur throughout my questionnaire responses yet in most cases politically determined qualifications of some sort must be met before the editors aesthetic judgment is exercised and this pairing of considerations can lead to curious logical conflicts listen for instance to the contradiction in  respondent statement wee left oriented and feminist in emphasis extremely choosy about the men work we print though we don exclude them completely the artistic quality comes first in just about everything we print the politics of subject in times of great change    people naturally turn to the arts because it is the artists who are saying here is the new language to describe the change the new rhythm which orders the pulse of the  paula bennett coeditor of focus  and anyda marchant cofounder of naiad press  have commented on the negative impact which feminist politics can exert on women art  stated political orientations are of course not fixed and can change in surprising ways especially when there is staff turnover compare the following editorial statements from sibyl child in vol  no  founding editors candyce stapen and patricia gayet announced our goal is to present the reality of women participation in all the arts and to explore the variety of women impact on our culture sibyl child is a journal founded written illustrated printed and distributed by women for women  four years later in a collective editorial the six woman sibyl child staff wrote    we want the men to know that they are encouraged to send their stuff too and if it as good as the stuff the ladies send we will publish it 
women literary journals  change the new images with which to rebuild   james moore poet  for    women writers in particular there is the challenge and promise of a whole new psychic geography to be explored but there is also a difficult and dangerous walking on the ice as we try to find languages and images for a consciousness we are just coming into and with little in the past to support us adrienne rich poet  p  as my examination of their issues demonstrated the pages of women journals are filled with poetry fiction essays and graphics which focus on worldly matters like political activity and work force participation emotional experiences such as friendships between women motherdaughter relationships childhood parenthood love sex and social pressures to be prettythinfeminineyoung and the physical phenomena of puberty menstruation pregnancy childbirth breast cancer menopause and aging this last group of subjects omnipresent in women publications is rarely found in other literary periodicals also important are attempts to capture creatively the contributions of specific women to celebrate heroic figures and to create role models frequently encountered are works focused on great women of history myth and literature as well as on exemplary ordinary women such contemporary artists as georgia oeeffe and anna akhmatova and figures like inez garcia who have come to symbolize some aspect of women s situation also inspire poems among the women most busily developing their own print forums have been lesbians gay writers have always found it difficult to locate markets for their work but in the s and sixties quite graphic writing by men like allen ginsberg and james baldwin was not only published but popular while straightforward lesbian creations were likely to face opposition  a number of book publishers and journals arose therefore to provide an outlet for lesbian writing although not all have limited themselves to lesbian subject matter or writers of the journals i surveyed  are explicitly gay and have lesbian staffs though  for example len fulton who founded and edited the avant garde journal dust    recalls that a member of his editorial staff resigned over the acceptance of a lesbian poem  p  see also librarian ann allen shockley description of reactions to her novel loving her   among them are or were as the case may be daughters diana press kitchen table press lavender press metis press naiad press out  out books persephone press spinsters ink violet press and the women press collective for more about lesbian publishing see special issues of sinister wisdom on lesbian writing and publishing

women literary journals  stated purpose of presenting the full range of female experience within the constraints of literary quality women communicating although the two most apparent purposes of women little magazines are to provide exposure for work written by and about women a third and related purpose is the creation of communication networks in a poem often cited by feminists adrienne rich speaks of the true nature of poetry the driveto connect the dream of a common language  p  the sense of literature as sharing and communication of editors writers and readers as a contiguous interacting group is unusually strong in women literary journals indeed rich believes that before women writers took publication upon themselves their self awareness and artistic development were obstructed by lack of a sense of context of a continuous tradition    each feminist work has tended to be received as if it emerged from nowhere  p  the mere act of collecting between two covers many artistic descriptions by women of aspects of women lives constitutes creation of a communication tool for a delimited group when a minority sexual orientation andor strong feminist orientation are added to a magazine defining characteristics the goal of communication becomes basic to it and to judge by letters from readers which are sometimes printed is at least partially realized this goal was stated explicitly by some of my respondents particularly those from black maria innerviews primipara sinister wisdom second wave and kalliope which features interviews with women writers and artists these magazines are perhaps most sensitive to their role as a medium of communication in  second wave ran an editorial which grappled with the problem of purpose and the goal of connectedness and stands as a classic contemporary feminist statement  printed above the last sentences of the editorial was a poem by karen lindsey which concluded alone we are blindthe enemy seizes the visiondulls it fills it with shadowsister give me your light take minealone we see with their eyeswe are less than blindstay with me this is no small thing we hold in our handsand it is everything we have  a value related to communication is regionalism of the journals in my group  pnrmipara imposes a within state limit on submissions and for the most part distribution two additional journals admit to some regional favoritism but place a higher value on literary quality three more of the journals began as regional magazines but expanded for example black maria chicago women speak published its first 
 the library quarterly issues to provide local women with a unique place in which to meet speak learn and grow  in the third issue however chicago dropped from the subtitle and black maria became progressively less local drawing contributions from across the country devoting more space to literature and omitting editorial statements even in the absence of editorial content political identity in some shape some form does pervade  of these journals even those which publish no essays or editorials at all limiting themselves to poetry fiction andor graphics have a political statement to make how does this affect the submission pool and by extension artistic quality only suggestive data can be proffered submissions and selectivity the exclusion or limited representation of men work presumably sifts out about half of all potential contributors however the very fact that periodicals exist which do not attempt to recruit men as editors writers or readers may stimulate many women to write and to submit their writing for publication such a result is the aim of these periodicals none of the journals i surveyed was suffering from lack of submissions thirteen received more publishable work than they could print and  found the proportion of publishable material received about equal to their capacity only  journals had difficulty finding sufficient publishable submissions and most of these were rather highly selective as measured by acceptance ratios one respondent noted that enough good work came in but identifying it required reading through heaps of weaker submissions heaps of writing collectively mountains of writing seem to be littering editors floors from coast to coast being overwhelmed by manuscripts is cited throughout the published literature and frequently in responses to my questionnaires as a major problem for all little magazines with their harried unpaid staffs and minimal office space as a result most of the journals were able to be quite selective acceptance rates varied from  to  percent with atypical innerviews on the high end but the median rate was only  percent and only innerviews accepted more than  percent of submissions sixteen journals accepted  percent or less  accepted  percent or less and  took only   percent i did not attempt to determine how many submissions each journal receives but i did find that acceptance rate  there is always an avalanche of poetry but fiction graphic art essays and photography seem to be in shorter supply
