 journal of education for library and information science mall the internally supported transition from a publicly subsidized university to a self sustaining multiversity  at least in the public sector  has threatened the selfimage of many post secondary institutions and has contributed to the pernicious notion that colleges and universities must be all things to all people another internal force that is greatly shaping master programs today concerns the socialization of new faculty and students although new students and faculty are often brought into a department because of the diversity in thought they exhibit the structure of our professional communications and rewards systems are often so rigid that these bright lights quickly become like those surrounding them  highly over socialized lonely specialists  or they leave this culture leaves master programs with little opportunity for renewed vitality or creativity ideas that may sound intriguing and potentially beneficial to the long term health of the program quickly become mere pipe dreams in an over socialized environment the current shortage of qualified faculty is related to the problem of over socialization but it is also a separate internal force pushing master programs to re think the current faculty make up and needs of their departments in the face of severe shortages programs may need to hire part time adjunct instructors including local practitioners phds from a variety of other fields may now be invited to teach courses within what may have once been considered a specialized field the teaching loads of full time faculty may have to be increased in some departments leaving little time or resources for research and current students may be groomed for academic careers in order to cope with the high number of current openings in certain fields finally university wide pressure to reorganize can also affect master degree programs impending forced mergers of schools or departments or calls to eliminate program duplication threaten the independence and indeed the existence of master programs that are part of those targeted schools or departments programs that find themselves in this risky position may become staunch supporters of the status quo refusing to relinquish the little autonomy they have or they may be driven to create new partnerships and find new ways of sharing resources with other departments potential pitfalls three models of change and innovation in master programs individually and collectively the forces identified above invite  even require  those of us invested in master education to consider serious reevaluation of our programs if we are to maintain much less enhance our positions in such a turbulent environment drawing on the lessons of programs in similar circumstances as well as our own observations on a wide range of changes and innovations currently taking place in master education it seems likely that faculty and administrators in lis will give consideration to three alternative models of change and innovation virtual programs corporate training programs and service station programs on the grounds that each of these appears attractive but is fraught with potential pitfalls we briefly examine each model  including its proclaimed benefits  and then suggest its limitations as a strategy for addressing the external and internal forces influencing master programs in library and information science virtual master programs in fields from education to business and engineering  and in private institutions as well as public universities  programs from throughout the nation are turning albeit in varying degrees to a virtual program model notwithstanding the considerable variation in these programs these programs are centered around the twin axes of hightechnology and convenience of course delivery compared to traditional on campus delivery at designated times and places students in these program are often attracted to the flexibility of the programs  flexibility volume  number

 journal of education for library and information science may find that the impact of having the bulk of its funds come directly from business and industry may be that the corporation can essentially dictate  if not through direct control than through what wolff terms carrots  how its program will carry out its mission of teaching and learning increasing reliance on outside funds will make a program appear self sufficient to the university and may lead to a decrease of university dollars thereby forcing the program to become ever more reliant on the corporate model it is not only simply dangerous to rely heavily on the livelihood integrity and goodwill of corporations it can be an affront to our own distinctive contributions to society and institutional strengths we must continue to recognize that the strength of the professional master program lies in our ability to critique and improve upon current systems and processes already in place without our current ability to stand above the fray we will lose our positions of autonomous respected programs in the service of our students and professional communities although we appreciate that some partnering between businesses and professional master programs can be desirable and in some instances may even be necessary we would also suggest that a wholehearted embrace of the corporate training model will ensure that the needs and values of the corporation can easily become predominant in our curricula service station programs this model was applied to the university as early as  by abraham flexner and was later revived and refined by clark kerr in his discussion of the multiversity in the uses of the university within the context of professional master programs this model suggests that the incorporation and coordination of a variety of activities aimed at pleasing any number of constituents is the preferred course in an ever changing world the appeal of adopting the service station model is considerable and not least because many of our programs are already adhering to this model in some way by trying to please students faculty staff employers and the general public through the adoption of new courses certificate programs and outreach activities the widelyaccepted mantra to be indispensable in a time of increased cutbacks and accountability is understandable as is the attempt to anticipate and then address the needs of constituents who live in a fast paced and service oriented world from our perspective being all things to all people is probably not the way to survive the myriad external and internal forces making demands of master programs instead of securing professional master programs a place of leadership in the st century the service station model will most likely water down programs filling them with overextended and unresponsive faculty and ambivalent dabbling students while responding to constituents and becoming a center for change and innovation are admirable qualities in a master program we advise that the service station model be avoided instead we suggest that internal reflections on outside needs followed by conscientious decision making is a much more useful approach for navigating major internal and external forces influencing master education co urses ofaction for positioning lis master programs in light of the external and internal forces acting on master programs and mindful of the limitations of popular models of change and innovation we conclude by advancing five courses of action aimed at positioning lis master programs to avoid pitfalls and seize opportunities for the foreseeable future we briefly outline each course of action and indicate how it might contribute to positioning master programs know thyself forge a programmatic identity as a beginning point we think it imperative that everyone invested in lis master programs seriously conjoin the question of volume  number

positioning master programs in library and information science  and their graduates is critical in our research on master programs we identified one approach to community engagement that we found especially compelling in terms of student learning and development a collaborative approach to engagement in this approach faculty and administrators view their master programs as being of the region or community of which they are a part unlike many of their colleagues in other master programs faculty regularly see their programs and the communities they serve in interdependent terms actively seeking to work the interface between academe and the workplace by participating in joint research ventures collaborative partnerships and educational exchanges faculty in these programs seldom see knowledge as theoretical or applied preferring instead to emphasize to their students the interrelatedness of knowledge research and practice in schon terms faculty in this set of programs design curricula and learning experiences that prepare their graduates as reflective practitioners within their respective professions in short we suggest that engagement  of learners and their learning environments both in and outside of the university  is an important touchstone that should be given consideration by faculty administrators and students and other key stakeholders in reconceptualizing high quality and in turn giving it expression not least significant we anticipate that students will continue to press for more active forms of learning and engagement moreover employers can be expected to press for more collaborative approaches that are anchored in bridges that better connect programs with the problems and realities that define professional practice in the non university workplace incorporate assessment into program design document student learning consonant with our predicted emphasis on engagement we expect that there will be increasing demands placed on faculty and administrators to document the value of master degrees to students employers and institutional administrators in the coming years we foresee that assessment will no longer be a mere optional activity but instead will be one virtually required of programs as we see it students and employers will be attracted to those programs that clearly demonstrate and communicate the value they add to their graduates and institutional administrators will fuel accountability by demanding such evidence in making resource allocations among competing priorities on their campuses to be sure some programs are involved in assessment at the master level and we suspect that lis programs are ahead of programs in many other fields but most assessments in higher education are less focused on what graduates are learning much less on the ways in which programs are contributing to those learning outcomes in the highly competitive marketplaces of today and tomorrow where a premium is placed on graduates who are highly skilled and who are either being supported financially by employers or are paying out of pocket for master degrees both students and employers are asking probing questions about the value and outcomes of master programs we strongly urge lis master programs to embrace systematic approaches to ongoing assessment  with particular emphasis on student learning outcomes we find helpful angelo definition of a systematic assessment program one that provides an ongoing process aimed at understanding and improving student learning    that involves making our expectations explicit and public setting appropriate criteria and high standards for learning systematically gathering analyzing and interpreting evidence to determine how well performance matches those expectations and standards and using the resulting information to document explain and improve performance developing new measures or indicators of quality in master programs is critical we believe for those involved in master programs in library and information science especially if we are to define highquality programs in ways that embrace a spring
