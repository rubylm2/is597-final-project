introduction historians of reading commonly adopt classical economicor market models to explain the spread of reading materials in the west the best articulated and most influential is robert darntons communications circuit  p  such theories separate the structural functions of textual production and consumption and tend to depict readers as at the final receiving stage of a production process only tenuously connected to the writers at the beginning thus they set up a distinction between authoritative print producers writers and publishers and comparatively passive consumers readers by contrast other scholars anxious to emphasize reader agency focus on reading resistance sometimes employing a poaching metaphor especially for ordinary readers of popular materials who may have left no personal record of their encounters with texts in this article i assess the contributions of these two theoretical approaches i suggest that since the first focuses primarily on structural factors in the commercial circulation of books and the second primarily looks at individual readers neither can make a link between structural accounts involving say gender race and class and the agency of individual readers both also dichotomize the acts of reading and writing and marginalize the many noncommercial sites where later nineteenth and twentiethcentury readers encountered texts while recognizing that market models and resistance approaches have given rise to much illuminating work i suggest that we can overcome some of their limitations by paying more focused attention to institutional sites of reading using organizations as a middle layer of analysis can bridge the gap between structure and agency and between macro and micro views these sites which include noncommercial organizations such as schools and churches as well as commercial organizations such as mailorder houses are also spaces where activities of reading and writing may intersect since they provide opportunities for individuals to both produce and consume texts finally by adopting an institutional view researchers can incorporate thick description in a way that adds richness and nuance to their understanding of the acts of reading and writing by those nonelite groups for whom individual records are scant   this work originally appeared in daedalus  no  summer   market models darntons communications circuit presents a birdseye or societallevel view of a marketcentered print world that sees participants in terms of largescale categories occupying distinct and separate nodes on the circuit authors publishers printers readers and so on one of the many strengths of darntons model is that it extends the limited tripartite framework of textual production distribution and reception that printculture historians have also commonly used  pp   p  both this simpler tripartite view and the more elaborate communications circuit draw on a transmissions theory of communications to depict texts as messages that move mostly in one direction from authors and publishers senders to readers receivers by providing links between producers distributors and receivers joan shelley rubin argues darntons model gives researchers a way to conceive of overlapping or connected roles that cross these structures after all she notes readers may actually occupy a variety of roles in the communications circuit while some may be ordinary members of the broad educated public others may be literary critics teachers librarians or ministers who are involved in dissemination as well as function as an audience that influences production  pp  however in recognizing the dangers of a tripartite model that theoretically segregates what are often overlapping functions rubin may be crediting the communication circuit model with too much explanatory power indeed overlap might be seen as a modification of the model rather than an integral feature of it in darntons system readers and writers are separated from each other by the mostly onedirectional flow of print writers at the beginning readers at the end although he does provide for a weak feedback loop by which readers have the capability to respond to authors perhaps through fan mail letters to publishers or even the exercise of purchasing power by treating the various printculture elements as discrete boxes on a circuit that resembles a wiring diagram the communications circuit does not try to account for the ways in which the elements actually relate to one another thus although darnton posits movement of texts and describes his elements as links the model does not specify the ways in which those links are achieved in historical reality indeed the model provides no hint as to the activities undertaken at the nodes themselves again drawing on the metaphor of the wiring diagram each node is conceived of as a black box the operations of which are not specified in terms of the circuit as a whole directional arrows encourage us to imagine the nodes in terms of inputs and outputs an authors output is a publishers input for instance to figure out what is going on inside each of the boxes how input is transformed into output or how the relationship between the boxes is achieved in historical reality we have to step outside the metaphor of the circuit underlying the communication circuit is the assumption that the relationship between the nodes on the circuit and the character of the activities within the nodes are primarily commercial and based on the pursuit of profit the character of much printing and publishing as a business has been firmly established at least since the enlightenment and many book historians have cast the story of eighteenth nineteenth and twentiethcentury print culture in terms of printculture capitalisma system in which the demand for and supply of texts are seen as separate economic activities carried out by distinct groups of consumers and producers  a view that conceives of print culture primarily in terms of a publishing market encourages scholars to conceptualize supply and demand in terms of producers and production authors editors artists publishers publication and consumers and consumption readers and the act of reading in the idealized classical theory of demand and supply consumption is the sphere of numerous individuals who act independently to exercise rational choice ideally producers too are numerous each controlling only part of the market supply however even during the nineteenth century economic theorists could not ignore the fact that the production side of this ideal picture failed to meet their expectations as the effects of market concentration monopoly and price fixing in many industries including publishing became only too obvious as many commentators have pointed out the commerce of publishing underwent a profound change as a result of publishing mergers as well as the growth of mass marketing practices in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries  p  new genres of print arose including popular magazines newspapers and cheap paperback books along with innovative marketing ploys such as mailorder book clubs and increasingly sophisticated forms of advertising  commentators see this largescale textual production and distribution as a key feature of print culture during this period and also characterize it as a time in which readers consumers found themselves at the receiving end of a largescale industrial process in the face of the concentrated power of the major publishing houses how could scholars imagine individual readers as other than powerless economically weak and dispersed generalizing from the eighteenth and nineteenthcentury growth of the literary marketplace the communications circuit represents a macro approach that enables the researcher to envisage a unified print culture consisting of elements that exercise the conceptually separate functions of producing distributing and consuming darnton describes the circuit as a general model for analyzing the way books come into being and spread through society and claims that with minor adjustments it should apply to all periods in the history of the printed book  p  but as he points out models have a way of freezing human beings out of history  p  in other words such models tend to emphasize social structure at the expense of the actions of individuals the model also leaves little space for thinking about communication in nonfunctionalist nonmarket terms communication as ritual for example or as james carey puts it as that symbolic process whereby reality is produced maintained repaired and transformed  p  a common criticism of functionalist theories in general is that they fail to explain or take account of social conflict they present participants as playing roles that support the smooth operation of the system but provide little room for individual interpretation or for acts that do not conform to mainstream norms sociological theories that emphasize structure are particularly open to this criticism in the field of printculture history some scholars unhappy with the characterization of readers as en bloc passive and powerless have adopted some variation of conflict theory pierre bourdieus theory of how cultural capital contributes to class stratification and reproduction for example  others have launched a counteroffensive strongly influenced by foucault that emphasizes the power of readerly agency by drawing heavily on the notion of reader resistance however a difficulty facing theories that focus on human agency is that of providing theoretical space for social structure a concept that few would want to dispense with entirely as sociologist david walsh explains every conception of social structure must ultimately reduce to what people do in society yet society always consists of particular and institutionalized forms of the organization of these actions  pp  the structureagency dichotomy is related to what sociologists call the macromicro dilemmahow descriptions and explanations of specific circumstances can be explained in terms of bigpicture metatheories like those of say gramsci and foucault that employ overarching explanatory dimensions such as class race and gender darnton developed his communications circuit theory at a time when printculture history was new and struggling to establish its legitimacy as a field of scholarship darntons own research is impressively microhistorical never does he himself freeze individual people out of the stories he tells yet perhaps because book historians rarely reflect in print on their research methodologies unlike say sociologists his communications circuit theory continues to stand out as one of the few successful efforts to make explicit underlying assumptions about the material conditions by which texts arrived in readers hands some historians have attempted to adjust the communications circuit see eg  p  but have so far failed to eclipse darntons original version   in electrical engineering the contents of the black box itself are unknown and can only be specified in terms of its inputs and outputs   to overcome this darnton advocates close scrutiny of each of the models elements at particular points in time and space darnton himself offers by way of illustration a case study of one particular element in the circuitthe bookseller link in eighteenthcentury france  p    for conflict theorists like karl marx and antonio gramsci a key problem in sociology is to account for social stratification and differentials in the distribution of power and resources   traditionally stratification has referred to class theories but stratification by other dimensions including gender race and age is of course also of interest to printculture historians see also the discussion in  pp    the pervasiveness of the concept of resistance is illustrated by the introduction to a recently published volume of collected essays for example the editors comment not all of the readers acts examined in this collection are resistant as though they had to explain the absence of resistance  p ix   joan shelley rubins essay  is a welcome exception to this lack of reflexivity for overviews of theories and methods in printculture history see also   reader resistance shortly after darntons communications circuit theory first appeared michel de certeaus linvention du quotidien was published in english under the title the practice of everyday life  along with roger chartiers theory of appropriation de certeaus conceptualization of the reader as poacher has been immensely influential especially among literary scholars eager to emphasize reader agency and at the same time keen to move away from the close textual rigors of the new criticism and into the expansive world of cultural history cultural consumption whether popular or not writes chartier in an effort to break down the consumerproducer dichotomy is at the same time a form of production which creates ways of using that cannot be limited to the intentions of those who produce  p  however de certeau seems to reinforce the distinction between writers and readers in the practice of everyday life he describes reading as a process that transforms another persons property into a space borrowed for a moment by a transient the reader insinuates into another persons text the ruses of pleasure and appropriation he poaches on it is transported into it pluralizes himself in it  p xxi in what is arguably the books most famous passage he states far from being writersfounders of their own place heirs of the peasants of earlier ages now working on the soil of language diggers of wells and builders of housesreaders are travelers they move across lands belonging to someone else like nomads poaching their way across fields they did not write despoiling the wealth of egypt to enjoy it themselves  p  poaching in the work of de certeaus many admirers becomes a metaphor for striking back against oppressive systems that envisage print production distribution and reception in structurally topdown terms and instead supposedly provides theoretical space for ordinary readers to exercise agency but as even these brief passages make clear de certeau separates and contrasts the acts of reading and writing implicitly supporting the economic concept of the producers of texts occupying a separate category from that of consumers moreover in describing readers as poachers he underscores their inferior and relatively powerless state compared with that of authors and publishers as the owners of the poached objectsthe textual rabbits pheasant and deer indeed in asserting the authority of writers over printed texts analysts like de certeau mirror a conception of poaching in which historically poaching is defined by game laws social systems that define as illegitimate hunting activities that indigenous peoples have practiced since time immemorial and that expropriate their hunting rights into the concept of reader poaching is built the understanding that ownership of the territory of books and reading is vested although perhaps in an exploitative fashion in an elite group of writers use of words like despoil underlines the illegitimacy of poaching through reading in the case of game poaching it is clear that poachers generally know that what they are doing is illegal even though they may justify or rationalize it as resistance for the poaching analogy to be valid resisting readers themselves must demonstrate not only an awareness of an authoritatively determined hierarchy of reading but also defiance in the face of that authority to understand the implications of poaching and its usefulness in eliciting the meaning of being a reader historians need to look both at elite authoritative discourse on reading and at the actual practices descriptions and justifications of real historical individuals and groups who assume a reading identity at specific points in time and place resistance may be a useful concept to apply to readers but needs to be applied selectively not all the reading of ordinary or nonelite readers can be assumed to be resistant and far less should researchers indiscriminately describe their reading as poaching these notions of resistance appropriation and above all poaching carry other disadvantages too although in de certeaus original formulation all reading is seen as a kind of poaching scholars have come to apply the term selectively to a particular set of ordinary readers this discrimination is telling in their zeal to recover reader agency professional readers in the academy have adopted and adapted de certeaus poaching simile as especially apt for a particular subset of other readersreaders who unlike their implied selves are especially heavy consumers of massproduced popular texts particularly genre fiction and comics the result is a kind of poaching squared in which academic readers themselves appropriate the reading of the alleged poachers in her work on the compilation of scrapbooks ellen gruber garvey criticizes poaching as a suitable metaphor for what scrapbook compilers do on the grounds that its connotations are too masculine for a practice so often engaged in by women  pp  she suggests as an alternative the idea of gleaning pointing to biblical references that support the right of the poor to sift through for their personal use the last leavings of the harvest gleaning seems a particularly appropriate way to describe the careful and largely idiosyncratic selection processes involved in the production of personal scrapbooks that were designed exclusively for the satisfaction of the compiler and perhaps her friends and family to describe reading in more general terms however gleaning is not necessarily an improvement on poaching although it lacks the connotations of illegality that attach to poaching gleaning is by definition a marginal operation performed after the main action the harvest is over and the gleaners themselves are relatively powerless with respect to the landowner over whose fields they scavenge   for examples of works in the history of books and reading that make use of de certeaus poaching metaphor see  writers on popular culture include   bridging the gap organizations a fundamental theoretical and methodological problem arises from the gap between two levels of analysis how can descriptions and explanations at the societal levelthe big picturemesh with those of individual people living their everyday lives how do individual agents and social structures confront and influence each other this problema form of the macromicro dilemmais evident in contemporary printculture studies societal influences may be cast in terms of macrorelational dimensions such as class gender race religion ethnicity and sexual orientation yet the close empirical work of book studies takes place at the micro level of individual actorsthis writer these readers this text here there at specific points in time and space how can the specific outcomes of individual actions be satisfactorily describedlet alone explainedin terms of metatheoretical concepts such as power and discourse by what actual mechanisms do these translations take place a number of scholars influential in the study of print culture have proposed midlevel concepts that can potentially bridge the gap between the individual and society readers are not alone they point out stanley fish has introduced the concept of the interpretive community of those who share cultural assumptions about the meanings of texts while benedict anderson posits imagined communities of those reading the same printed texts but never meeting facetoface   encouraging researchers to think of reading as constituting a cluster of social and cultural activities that take place among groups in a variety of contexts sociologist elizabeth long draws attention to the social infrastructure of reading  p  turning to the methods of ethnography some printculture historians have adopted clifford geertzs famous phrase thick description as common currency  geertz originally appropriated the idea of thick description from the philosopher gilbert ryle who likened it to a manylayered sandwich  p  what ryle thought of as layers in a sandwich geertz called the sort of piled up structures of inference and implication through which an ethnographer is continually trying to pick his way  p  although all these recommendations suggest illuminating ways of envisaging a middle layer of analysis a problem for printculture scholars remains how are we to operationalize this concept in research for a prescription that is both theoretically and operationally useful historians of reading can turn to the work of sociologist paul dimaggio who recommended organizationswhat he calls the meso level of analysisas major sites at which individuals actually encounter the structures of the wider society role theory is one way to envisage this interaction organizational roles seen in cultural and relational terms as both institutional typifications and locations in relational networks can create a bridge between the micro and macro levels of analysis he argued  p  following dimaggios advice printculture historians especially those of later nineteenth and twentiethcentury america can use the analysis of social institutions to uncover the missing middle layer between structure and agency during this period noncommercial as well as commercial organizations played a growing part in the development of reading as a widespread cultural practice in the united states as reading spread not randomly from individual to individual but along increasingly welldefined grooves or pathways that formed layered networks of print some of these networks were visible such as the railroads and later the highways that carried printed materialsbooks newspapers magazines manuals and pamphletsto the communities that bordered the tracks and roadways the networked character of other channels lacked such an obvious physical dimension and yet was no less real or material as public and private organizations took advantage of technological innovations new channels of distribution falling production prices and widespread literacy to establish maintain and promote their activities and identities through print the significance of literary commercial organizations such as publishing houses and book clubs is obvious but other commercial organizations such as banks insurance companies and retail merchandising outlets both stores and mailorder catalogs also embedded print production and consumption into their daily operations in the shape of annual and other reports rules regulations and advertising in the developing public sphere government agencies schools and libraries not only used print as a means of communicating shared ideas but also actively encouraged participating groups and individuals to read as a means to active citizenship selfimprovement and moral worthiness in  for example passage of the post office act which awarded a generous subsidy if anything an antimarket concept to the mailing of newspapers at the expense of private communication was a vital factor in the astonishing spread of newspapers in the early republic  p   p  churches and voluntary organizations too formed networks for the exchange of printed materials and to communicate information to their sometimes widely dispersed members institutions of print less obvious to modern eyes were governmentsponsored organizations such as the agricultural extension system and social service organizations such as settlement houses and the ymca many of these organizations operated outside the mainstream commercial market and yet were enormously influential in the late nineteenth century for instance roman catholics formed a parallel print culture in which parishes rather than mainstream protestant commercial companies formed channels of circulation  pp  in a contemporary example readers of the immensely popular left behind series of books depicting a post rapture world often share their books through nonmarket channels in the lives of these readers too churches are key printculture elements  whether commercial or not bureaucratic features that undergirded their claims to power and influence characterized all of these organizations to some extent max webers ideal type of bureaucracy with its clear definition of responsibility among officials hierarchical organization of work and offices recruitment of personnel based on technical criteria and government of work by rules not just arbitrary relationships clearly defined emerging social institutions such as libraries schools the agricultural extension agencies womens clubs and churches positions in organizations included those that provided an income such as editor minister teacher librarian home economist extension worker radio homemaker and those that did notbook club participant scout leader womens club member or library patron these institutions recordkeeping and textualproduction practices make them particularly amenable to study by historians of print culture for example the retention by archivists of postal account books has helped historians to recover the newspaper subscription choices of private individuals  p  other governmentsponsored organizations such as the agricultural extension agency or the rural school system routinely provided access to standard forms of print that included informational genres such as pamphlets leaflets textbooks and reference books schools and libraries provided students with opportunities to read for pleasure and cultural selfdevelopment organizational analysis can also complicate the readerwriter dichotomy as ronald j zboray and mary saracino zboray point out in the antebellum period a much greater number of ordinary people than the conventional picture presents participated in print culture through the social sharing of literary texts this social dissemination far outweighed market distribution they argue through such organizations as literary societies local lyceums and the common school  p xxiv later in the century too large numbers of ordinary men and women frequently wrote for others like themselves in the columns of local newspapers and farm journals a practice that continued well into the twentieth century official sites of reading were also sites of writing mary kelley shows how even in the early nineteenth century young women who attended female academies and seminaries and who belonged to literary societies learned to write for each other and for publication their activities blended reading and writing in an effort not only to shape their own development but also to influence public opinion  as the century wore on institutional opportunities for writing expanded in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries extensionsponsored homemakers clubs channeled reading materials to rural women and also provided related cultural opportunities in the form of writing and performing plays and keeping journals at school students and teachers worked on writing assignments that grew more complex as students advanced through the system increasing numbers of collegeeducated men and women joined professions including nonliterary occupations such as lawyers clergy professors engineers and physicians in which they exercised their expertise through encounters with texts as readers and writers  p  as actors occupying organizational roles ordinary americans who left no personal records may emerge through what are sometimes considered to be dry bureaucratic documents progressive era librarian lutie stearns for instance greatly influenced public library development not only in her native wisconsin but nationally through her speeches at professional conferences and journal articles a founder of the wisconsin free library commission wflc stearns between  and  helped found  public libraries and oversaw the administration of  traveling libraries and fourteen county traveling library systems  p  unpublished institutional records of the wflc can be found in the archives of the wisconsin historical society yet no mention of stearns appears in the archives catalog only with the knowledge that stearns occupied the organizational position of library visitor in charge of the traveling libraries can the scholar track down her extraordinarily vivid and detailed official biweekly reportsinstitutional documents in which her own voice still sounds clear and strong a century later it is her organizational activities as represented in these documents that allow us to place stearns as an individual actor in the broader scene of womens participation in progressive era print culture   in  p  clifford geertz argued the whole point of semiotic approach to culture is  to aid us in gaining access to the conceptual world in which our subjects live so that we can in some extended sense of the term converse with them   at a macroanalytical level sociologists study events or structures that are more long lasting embrace more people and are more spatially extensive than relatively micro levels by contrast micro levels of analysis consider individual people and small groups acting on the world in the context of their everyday lives  pp     in the early twentieth century sociologist max weber explained the distribution and exercise of power and authority by reference to three bases of legitimation charismatic which rested on the power of personality and the special qualities of the leader traditional as for example in feudalism and third rationallegal of which bureaucracy which he saw emerging from the transformation of western economic systems to industrialism was the highest form   farm and county newspapers relied particularly on the writings of readercontributors for example membership of a group of farm women columnists that called themselves the press columnists of iowa peaked in the s and persisted well into the later decades of the century  reading writing and control bringing organizations into close focus helps scholars see both how some people attempted to control the reading of others and how some readers resisted these efforts although it is probably true that all reading cultures construct hierarchies of good and bad reading the specific boundaries set around the textual field and the nature of the groups who attempt to set those boundaries vary over time and space an extensive literature describes the stratification of reading during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and explains this at least in part as an attempt to control the chaos resulting from the publishing explosion that accompanied the industrialization of print production and distribution as well as the spread of mass literacy for the last two centuries educational experts librarians and other cultural authorities have held to a reading ideology that posited contrasts between worthwhile reading as an exercise in reason that served to inform or instruct and reading that evoked passion and aimed to amuse or divert throughout the nineteenth century reading fiction was an especially contested practice in the developing public institutions of the school and library those librarians who joined the debate over the fiction problem fell into three categories although a small minority called for total abstinence most argued for a reluctant tolerance commenting that taxpayers had a right to determine how their tax dollars be spent yet others pointed out advantages to fiction writing in  samuel s green supported even sensational fiction if it gave young persons a taste for reading  pp  any reading this argument implied was better than none at all especially if it encouraged people to progress up the literary ladder moreover the poor were likely to need the diversions that an entertaining book could supply library leaders reading ideology was thus embedded in an underlying matrix of class relationships in the urbanizing world of late nineteenthcentury america gender relations too contributed to leading librarians construction of the ideal reader middle class women have long been assumed to be the principal readers of fiction although actual evidence suggests that men too read novels in large numbers  pp  moreover librarianship is a profession stratified by gender early public library leaders were all men and even today although women predominate in clerical and middle management jobs men still occupy executive positions in disproportionate numbers the strictures of late nineteenthcentury library leaders aimed not only at counteracting supposed female reading patterns by controlling what books and magazines libraries collected but also at shaping the professional practices of themostlywomen who actually came into facetoface contact with patrons during the early twentieth century progressive era reformers inserted a new value for information as an objective commodity into professional discourse and public consciousness whereas nineteenthcentury thought held that the best reading involved sustained thoughtful engagement with texts whether nonfiction or the better class of fiction by the end of the twentieth century the concept of information had taken hold in the american imagination as a focus of public policy as well as a source of corporate and personal advantage information became separated from reading as ease speed and quantity of access took precedence over the formerly valued sustained engagement with texts sometimes these categories of print presented separate and competing justifications for claims on community resources as officials stressed the value of information in contrast to that of stories at the same time these distinctions were not necessarily clear to all readers when a schoolchild or a homemaker read a historical novel was she reading for pleasure or information  p  did readers draw a line between reading for selfimprovement and reading for fun and if so where in the minds of individual readers as well as of those who helped shape their reading the boundaries between literature stories information and trash blurred and shifted depending on circumstances of time and space as children in s rural wisconsin marlene and delores eagerly engaged in comic book reading of which they knew their parents teachers and local librarians disapproved later however a more liberal policy was adopted some peoples philosophy was if the children were reading a comic book they were reading junk said delores but i let them read that book if you were learning to read what difference  if its a comic book because that might get you interested in reading something else  p  over time the childrens resistance to official reading values transformed into accordance as during the next few decades librarians dropped much of their opposition to the reading of popular fiction to the extent that a popular textbook used in library education at the turn of the twentyfirst century proclaims never apologize for your reading tastes  p xii analyzing organizations can also reveal how certain voices are privileged during the nineteenth and much of the twentieth century the range of organizations in which women african americans native americans asians and even white americans of eastern and southern european descent could participate was restricted native americans found themselves excluded by law custom and distance segregated as they often were on remote reservations that lacked amenities considered basic elsewhere asian immigrants forbidden citizenship until the s were subject to many of the same legal and cultural constraints and were similarly neglected by public sector workers such as librarians federal and state laws and local customs systematically excluded black americans from full participation even in taxsupported organizations such as public schools universities and public libraries in parts of the country where jim crow laws mandated segregated accommodations schools libraries and extension facilities were always vastly inferior to those on offer to whites in the north too access to technically unsegregated organizations was patchy and uncertain african americans organized voluntary organizations including colleges universities churches and selfhelp groups often very successfully but these tended to lack financial and other resources the cultures of print established and sustained by most mainstream organizations operated in an inescapably racist worldone in which the significance of culturally constructed racial difference was so taken for granted that it went unremarked at least by the white majority the popular novels that public library patrons of all ages found on the library shelves at the turn of the twentieth century would have done little to shake acceptance of the belief that the racial and ethnic ordering of american society was anything but natural and appropriate in this respect the print culture fostered by publicly sponsored organizations such as libraries and the extension service meshed well with that of the commercial publishers of bestselling novels to sustain a general acceptance of white superiority through texts racism was built into the very fabric of the institutions that were developing at that timeincluding those like public libraries that ostensibly supported republican principles of democratization womens role as civilizers fit well into a contemporary reform discourse that called for americanizing immigrants and uplifting blacksgroups of people seen as a matter of course as naturally primitive culturally and racially inferior and in need of philanthropic and later professional aid working class people too were seen as uncivilized by reformers who explained their poverty as resulting from individual deficiencies such as laziness sin and ignorance rather than from group conditions related to structural factors such as economic exploitation thus nineteenthcentury readingrelated ideologies that appealed to the need to civilize immigrants the poor and people of color made deeply racist assumptions that embedded themselves in the organizational discourse of librarians and teachers in ways that persisted throughout the twentieth century individual resistance in the form of textual appropriation is not the only kind of resistance readers also engaged in organized and selfconscious collective rejection of mainstream values and policies although some organizations provided opportunities for the powerful to exercise control others provided the context within which marginalized people rejected the conditions of their oppression both as individuals and in groups organizational analysis can uncover the historical instances in which working men and women joined unions and wrote for the labor press immigrants founded associations and published newspapers in their native languages and african americans formed literary societies and read and wrote poems stories and articles that they shared with one another in midtwentiethcentury des moines iowa a group of black women took advantage of the segregated branch of the young womens christian association to form a book club in which they read not only popular novels and best sellers of the day but also books on race by w e b du bois walter white librarian nella larsen and sociologists e franklin frazier and allison davis for these womenwhose activities might have gone unnoticed by historians but for their organizational associationthe segregated space of the quasiofficial y provided space to resist the restrictions of mainstream print culture  organizations that had no links with officialdom also played a significant role in the print culture of millions as tony michels has shown in the early twentieth century russianspeaking jewish intellectuals living in new york learned yiddish specifically in order to write and publish yiddish newspapers and periodicals that presented a socialist agenda as well as literary works  these newspapers circulated not only all over the united states but also in eastern europe and czarist russia where censorship restricted native publications many of these intellectuals published in yiddish primarily out of political conviction whereas to earn a living they also wrote and published in english the new york yiddish press was just one example of the many ethnic publishing efforts some of which defined their goals in opposition with rather than conformity to mainstream anglophone publishing resistance can take place at the organizational as well as the individual level and can involve writing as well as reading   for an overview see  see also    william kite of the germantown

iowa conclusion market models and resistance approaches have provided valuable frameworks for envisaging print culture in terms on the one hand of largescale capitalist structures and on the other of individual acts of appropriation through reading yet they also carry disadvantages according to both print capitalism produced not only books but also readersa mass readershipon a large scale according to this theory most americans participated in print culture only on the receiving end of cultural influence as readers a small elite the conventional wisdom goes participated as both readers and writers occupying positions of influence either as communications producers or as literary landlords by virtue of their activities as published authors in both models the market for print mediates the relationship of the literary elite to the reading masses yet this dichotomized picture of readers and writers occupying separate social spaces is misleading while it is true that over the course of the nineteenth century a relatively small number of authors in comparison to the number of readers developed a professional relationship with profitable publishers as the producers of literary goods in the mass market this far from describes the whole picture of print culture in america at the time just as this dichotomy presents an oversimplified view of print culture so my depiction of printculture scholarship as falling into one camp or the other is also far too neat some influential works highlight other models such as william gilmores study of reading in rural new england that blends ecology and mentalité  or david paul nords work on the history of journalism that enlists the concept of community imagined and otherwise  richard brown employs the eighteenthcentury metaphor of diffusion  yet even works that specifically focus on institutional aspects of print culture such as mary kelleys excellent learning to stand and speak and on women and the shaping of print culture in the early and antebellum republic may not specifically highlight organizations as a unit of analysis nearly all of the early republics women writers made their own way into print kelley argues burgeoning economic opportunity heightened social mobility increased literacy and an expansive literary marketplace brought thousands of women into the world of print between the american revolution and the civil war  pp  one wonders why the growth of womens formal and informal educational organizations does not appear in this list of enabling factors after all increased literacy can be achieved extrainstitutionally the history of print culture in the united states has been dominated by scholars of the colonial early republic and antebellum periods while the period after  has received much less attention although this is changing  p  perhaps because of this concentration on the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries a period often defined in terms of the rise of industrial capitalism the concept of market has gained considerable power over scholars imaginations while institutions and organizationsphenomena that played an increasingly important part in american life as the nineteenth century progressedhave received less theoretical notice it is unlikely that any model in the history of reading can have universal application and treating organizations as a missing middle layer may be most appropriate for that period in american history when they gained such dominance the latter half of the nineteenth century and the twentieth century paying conscious attention to them encourages us to complicate the printculture scene in several ways first it helps us broaden our ideas of what kinds of texts to study along with those books and magazines that were commercially successful and thus more readily available to historians printculture scholarship can encompass a greater variety of material forms including newspapers periodicals manuals advertising school and college texts and all sorts of ephemera that despite their lack of commercial relevance had great significance in the lives of millions of americans second it points to the ways in which macro categories such as race gender and class can affect the distribution of power as well as the acts of individuals who use print to both exercise and resist that power third organizational analysis allows researchers to blur the conceptual boundary between reading and writing to show how many socalled ordinary americans participated in print culture both as readers and as writers not only does this encourage us to conceive of readers as active and far from powerless but it demonstrates that the concept of reader resistance only makes sense if applied selectively in some organizations resistance and conformity go hand in hand and perhaps inevitably so we cannot assume that simply because midtwentiethcentury cultural authorities condemned comics romances mysteries and westerns actual readers of such literature were necessarily exercising consistent resistance to official reading ideologies other organizations were explicitly devoted to counteracting the norms of mainstream society the act of joining could itself be a sign of resistance fourth recognizing the role of noncommercial as well as commercial organizations in providing opportunities for writing as well as reading helps us to move beyond the language of textual production and consumption combining the ethnographers attention to thick description with the theoretical focus on the meso or middle layer of analysis permits us to discern the activities of readers and writers within the same organizational spaces and to recognize the overlap between reading and writing not only for wellknown authors whose histories as readers and writers are relatively easily recoverable but also for the millions of ordinary readers and writers for whom the technologies and practices of literacy were an indispensable but often takenforgranted part of their everyday lives finally as the example of lutie stearns shows an organizational focus permits scholars to build up thick description by bringing to their attention primary sources that individual analysis could possibly overlook collections of institutional records that include minutes of meetings memos correspondence work diaries lists of publications postal records and in the case of libraries accessions and circulation records are rich repositories of primary source materials on print culture as actors occupying organizational roles ordinary americans who left no personal records may emerge through what are sometimes considered to be dry bureaucratic documents
