community studies in reading  sense in which that term is used throughout this study see table i method used to obtain informationit was decided that the most effective way to obtain information about the reading habits of these  non users was through personal interviews although often criticized because of the time it consumes the interview method does afford the opportunity to talk directly with the people to encourage their comments to clear up any misunderstandings and to discover the characteristic attitudes toward the library which go far deeper than mere stated reasons for non use by this method also the investigator hoped to table i analysis of the  registered voters number percentage men women total men women total library card holders     i    non users of the library        total     oot oot t to be read of the  registered voters  per cent of the men  per cent of the women and to per cent of the entire group are library card holders t the slight error in the sum of the items is due to the use of only one decimal reach many people who would probably ignore a questionnaire a comparison of the results obtained by the interview method used in this study and those obtained by miss kelley through the use of questionnaires shows that this assumption was justified for the percentage of return from the interviews was more than double the percentage of return from the questionnaires even though the former method was not as successful in procuring such personal information as age amount of schooling and nationality the interviews were usually made without any previous request or notice armed with a letter of introduction from the director of the queens borough public library which however  grace osgood kelley wooside does read d survey of the reading interests and habits of a local community jamaica ny queens borough public library i

community studies in redding  from the very first it was apparent that only the briefest notes could be taken during an interview if at all and these notes were made very casually on the back of the p slip containing the name and address of the person being located for purposes of uniformity ready comparisons and greater ease in tabulating results an intervew form was devised see appendix although in topical rather than question form many of the headings in this outline were suggested by the questionnaires used by dr waples and by miss kelley in their studies as the study progressed it was soon evident that there were many inaccuracies in the printed list of registered voters it was found also that people were very reluctant to give such personal information about themselves as age marital status amount of education and nationality accordingly the original registration records kept by the board of elections were consulted and data secured on all these points except education characteristics of the group studied sex and marital statusas table iii indicates  per cent of the  non users interviewed are men and  per cent are women a glance at table ii will show that this proportion of men and women is approximately the same as that found in the total group of  non users previously analyzed the fact that the percentage of men who do not use the library is greater than the percentage of women is brought out still more clearly perhaps in table i which classifies the  registered voters as either card holders or non users of the library although only  per cent of the people in this original group are men  per cent of the men do not use the library in contrast with only  per cent of the women similar evidence of the greater use of the library by women had been obtained by both miss kelly and b lamar johnson further consideration of table iii will show that i per cent of the non users interviewed are married the percentage of p ci  adult reading interests as related to sex and marital status school revicew xl anuary

 the library tuarterly the remaining  per cent had very definitely not gone beyond the elementary school the approximate accuracy of this estimate is supported by miss kelley findings in woodside she found that of the i non users of the library  per cent were high school students or graduates nearly  per cent had gone on to college or professional schools and about  per cent had only an elementaryschool education that the percentages in the last two groups should be exactly reversed in the present study is probably because of the number of negroes and italians among the nonusers interviewed in flushing country of birthit might well be supposed that a large number of the non users of the public library are foreigners and so are handicapped in their use of the library by difficulty with the language or by unfamiliarity with american institutions on the contrary table vi shows that over three fourths of the  non users interviewed are native born to be sure many of them are of foreign parentage but practically all have been brought up in the united states and have been educated in american public or private schools furthermore five of the other twelve countries represented are english speaking countries namely ireland england scotland canada and newfoundland inquiry concerning the naturalization date of each of the foreign born citizens revealed the fact that the earliest date is i and the most recent  inasmuch as the law requires that no alien shall become a citizen until he has resided within the united states for five years every one of the foreign born citizens interviewed must have lived in this country for at least that length of time the range was from five to forty six years so per cent of the group having lived here fifteen years or more italy heads the list of the non english speaking countries with seventeen representatives that it is harder to interest italians in books and in the public library than almost any other nationality has already been pointed out by may m sweet in t op cit

community studies in reading  vote four of the italians interviewed stated that they cannot read either english or their native language twenty five per cent of the group gave as a third reason for non use of their local library the use of other sources it will be remembered from the discussion of table xvi that these sources include other public libraries college or special libraries rental libraries book clubs purchase borrowing from friends gifts and private libraries in the home after no time to read do not like to read and other sources the fourth reason reported for not using the library was the inadequacy of the library itself this explanation was given by over i per cent of the group questioned and by approximately the same number of men as women the principal point of attack being the book collection several people complained that the library never has any new books or more particularly no new fiction a few gave specific titles that they could not obtain others cited various subjects upon which the library had been unable to furnish books and at least four people had the general impression that the library never has anything wanted although they admitted that they had never been in to inquire closely related to the adequacy of the book collection but more particularly concerned with the service of the library were the further complaints that the library is too slow in getting new books that there are not enough copies of popular titles that the books wanted are always out that library books are torn and dirty that library hours are inconvenient and that there is too much red tape in library records in fairness it should be pointed out perhaps that the flushing branch library like all of the other branches of the queens borough public library had no regular appropriation for books for several years and so had to depend upon its rental collection for both recent books and the replacement of older books the only reasons given for non use of the library in addition to those mentioned above were the indirect use of the library previously discussed and physical handicaps including illness poor eyesight and old age it is of interest that nearly  per cent of the group reported such handicaps to reading
 the library quarterly all of the explanations offered were accepted at their face value and no attempt has been made to check their validity with more objective data it is interesting however to compare these replies with those recorded by mr johnson in the article on adult reading interests already mentioned he reports that statements from  men and women revealed that only onethird of the entire group use the public library and adds the chief reasons given for not using the library were no time and not interested these two reasons were given by about three fourths of those not using the library thirteen per cent stated that they do not use the library because they have books available without going to the public library six per cent failed to give any reason for not using the library and s per cent indicated a number of miscellaneous reasons interests conflicting or competing with reading since lack of time for reading was the reason for non use of the library most frequently given inquiries were made concerning interests conflicting or competing with reading the activities indicated in table xxi therefore are those which the people themselves felt to interfere most with their reading of the ii people with whom primary interviews were obtained nearly  per cent confessed that the radio is the one interest that interfered most with their reading the popularity of the radio was carefully explained by many of the people interviewed once more accessibility plays a large part for as several people pointed out the radio is always there with a new program whereas books have to be replenished then too it requires so much less effort to listen to the radio than to read a book as might be anticipated the radio is even more popular with the women than with the men since they can listen to it during the day while they do the housework in the light of so much recent discussion on the reduction of hours of labor and the increase of leisure time it was surprising to find that over  per cent of the people directly questioned said that their work left them no time for reading a more careful check on this point showed that in addition to the few who spend several hours a day commuting to their work and a few is johnson op cit p

 the library quarterly conclusions summaryin this study of the reading habits of a group of representative non users of the flushing branch of the queens borough public library in flushing new york the following facts have been brought out i over  per cent of the registered voters in the election district in which the library is located were non users of the library on january i i  interviews were obtained for  of the  non users of the library a return of s per cent  approximately o per cent of the non users interviewed as well as o per cent of the total number of non users are men  about  per cent of both the men and women interviewed are in their thirties or forties and over o per cent are married the percentage of married men being much greater than the percentage of married women  the largest occupational groups represented are the homekeepers and the other non professional workers which together include nearly o per cent of all the people interviewed  more than three fourths of the group are native born americans  inquiries concerning the forms of material read by the non users of the library revealed that about  per cent read newspapers o per cent read magazines and only  per cent read books moreover although sex has no bearing on the number of people who read newspapers both magazines and books are read more frequently by women  when asked to indicate the form of reading material preferred o per cent of all the people interviewed reported that they prefer both newspapers and magazines to books  from the titles of the newspapers reported it was found that nearly  per cent of the non users of the library read one or both of the two local papers although the men tend to favor the metropolitan newspapers io the magazines most frequently read were the saturday evening post cosmopolitan good houskeeping delineator literary digest woman home companion and ladies home journal i i in addition to the  per cent who never read books
community studies in reading  nearly  per cent read them only occasionally so that in reality not more than  per cent of the entire group read books regularly i  an analysis of the types of books preferred by fifty three of the people who read books showed that fiction biography and books on business and technology were most popular among the men while fiction biography and books on religion were most popular among the women  although only about one fourth of the total number of people interviewed have ever used the flushing branch library  per cent of both the men and the women who read books are making indirect use of the library  the present use of the library by these readers who are technically non users includes primarily the reading of library books brought home by other members of the family and the use of family cards on the other hand these readers represent only one third of the people who reported that there were library cards in the family i besides the indirect use of the flushing branch library the sources of books most frequently mentioned by those who read books are purchase from bookstores and borrowing from rental libraries the former being more popular with the men and the latter with the women i approximately one half of the total number of the nonusers interviewed reported that their principal reason for not using the library is lack of time and specified that the radio and their work are the chief interests that compete or conflict with reading  nearly one fourth of the group stated that they do not use the library because they do not like to read or more specifically because they do not like to read books i other reasons given for non use of the library are that books are obtained from other sources that the library itself is inadequate or that reading is impossible because of physical handicaps some implications for the librarythe  people about whom information has been obtained in this study is too small a sample upon which to base any final conclusions as to the fac
 the library quarterly tors responsible for non use of the public library moreover before any definite conclusions can be reached comparative studies of similar groups of both users and non users of the library must be made from the data already obtained however certain general implications for the library are apparent i that the number of registered card holders is not an adequate indication of the actual number of people using the library is shown by the fact that one fourth of the non users interviewed reported that they are making indirect use of the library primarily through other members of the family  on the other hand the presence of a library card in the family does not necessarily indicate that other members of the family are using the library since only one third of all those who reported cards in the family are using them  the fact that o per cent of the non users of the library are men is significant since it has already been demonstrated that groups which differ in sex have marked differences in reading interest moreover from this study of the non users of the library it has been discovered that the material read by the men and that read by the women differs also in form and type  inasmuch as the majority of the men interviewed are nonprofessional workers and since the men who read books have expressed a preference for books on business and technology it would seem that the traditional emphasis of the public library on belles lettres might be modified to include more material on technical subjects s because of the large proportion of the non users of the library who prefer newspapers and magazines to books and because of the small proportion who read books regularly the public library must either find some way to stimulate a greater interest in books preferably in co operation with the other educational institutions in the community or else transfer its emphasis from books to other forms of reading material  approximately three fourths of the people interviewed said that they do not use the library because they have no time for reading or else no interest in it in all probability a lack of  douglas waples and r w tyler what people want to read about chicago university of chicago press ii p
