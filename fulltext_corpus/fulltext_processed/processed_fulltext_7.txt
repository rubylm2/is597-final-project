alternative perspectives in library and information science issues of race lorna peterson since the s most disciplines and schools of professional studies have developed their areas of curriculum research and theory construction by including race and ethnic studies at the same time library and information studies has lagged in providing a broader understanding of race and librarianship although attempts have been made to fill the racial understanding gap most of the work is characterized as exceptionalpioneer biography with little attention given to broader social constructs of race and racism this article explores how library and information science education falls short in contributing to the literature on race and racism the current multicultural movement in library science is to be addressed north american librarianship viewed through the lens of race results in a picture of conflict and cooperation on the one hand a picture emerges that mirrors the racism of the larger society segregation discrimination belief in racial superiorityinferiority and the desire to maintain the racist status quo are evident in library history on the other hand a picture of integrative human relations cooperation racial uplift and civil rights appears yet neither of these views is the full story of race and librarianship nor have these stories been integrated into library historiography to give a sharper focus on the issue of race and racism in our profession as du mont stated a lot of research yet needs to be done on the topic of ace in librarianship the purpose of this article is to explore and describe the racial conflict and cooperation characterized by our profession emphasis will be placed upon the africanamerican experience with the hope that others will investigate the unique stories of native americans asian americans and hispanics the terms african american and black will be used interchangeably in this article for no other reason than in my lifetime i have been termed colored negro afroamerican black and africanamerican i prefer the term black because its use was common when i became politically aware in this article conflict theory provides the framework for discussion of race and racism race in this article is acknowledged as a fluid social construct devised as a form of social control race is not a scientific principle and to make this distinction is imporspring  
 journal of education for library and information science about the author loma peterson is assistant professor school of information and library studies state university of new york at buffalo tant the use of conflict theory and the distinction of race as a social construct are significant to make for several reasons  conflict theory states that whenever two or more individuals or groups come into contact with each other the choice is made to be cooperative or conflictual  if conflictual power and dominance must be organized and articulated for social control  race and the categorization of differences can be used as a method of power dominance oppression and social control  race has been abandoned by the scientific community as having no basis in biological fact race has been recognized as a social construct with fluid meaning that changes over time yet the belief that race is a measurable and biological characteristic persists and shapes social functions such as law policy and customs  current categories of race in the united states various nations have different definitions are so broad that they only point out the meaninglessness of race as anything but a way to perpetuate oppressive stereotypes there is the interchanging of ethnicity for race which further muddles the terminology for example native americans an ethnicity the racial designation red is no longer used are as diverse in language culture belief systems and national characteristics as european nationals the cheyenne seneca zuni etc are all distinct and very different peoples hispanic which is recognized as an ethnicity also has the racial color consciousness of black and white although the latin american brand of color racism is not as rigid as the north american variety also the insistence that the cuban mexican puerto rican etc experience is somehow explained under the term hispanic is naive and misleading asian americans once the yellow race but now an ethnicity represent many nations languages and way of entry into the united states and using this term is as misleading as the use of hispanic or native american and for all groups rarely in the race discussion is the fact of social class given attention but how does a race become an ethnicity and why is the distinction important because whites who desire to claim exotic roots can define themselves as part native american or hispanic or asian there is otherness but not distinction as a separate race to articulate this is not to diminish the facts and shame of native american genocide miscegenation laws that prohibited white asian marriages as well as white black marriages japanese american concentration camps quotas against jews or any of the atrocities committed against ethnic and religious groups in this country it is further recognized that in different regions of the country the variety of racism practiced against these groups differs in involume  number

alternative perspectives   librarianship what attention has been given to library services during the time of segregated armed services ala was presumably surveying library schools because the world war ii effort saw a large scale mobilization of africanamericans into service and the segregated conditions of the armed services had a ripple effect on civilian employment certainly there is meaning to be uncovered in the words the demand for negro librarians in army camp libraries library science needs sophisticated analytical biographies particularly of african americans in order to understand the profession in a racial context the american library association controversies unlike most american professional associations the ala has never been deliberately segregated for example the national bar association exists because black lawyers were not permitted in the american bar association until  the national medical association was the black association parallel to the american medical association parallel associations in education home economics nursing and a variety of professions and occupations farming barbering etc existed because racial segregation was a fact of american life whether by law or custom this lack of a deliberately segregated history enhances the librarian image as being racially progressive but before librarianship congratulates itself for having a progressive integrated national association some unflattering facts need to be addressed what are some possible reasons that ala never closed membership by race a theory of library marginalization may explain this libraries are voluntary institutions use of libraries is not legislated contrast librarianship with education where there is the importance of compulsory participation up to a legislated age and issues of social control and social hierarchy emerge law concerns property and money medicine concerns the body contrasting these professions with a small one that has little influence on significant areas of private and public importance suggests that protection from race mixing was not a priority a more practical explanation is that in the late nineteenth to early twentieth century approximately  percent of the black population lived in the north where the library movement flourished entry into library schools was limited so the number of blacks in librarianship was small a separate but equal ethos was part of librarian attitudes especially after the south developed libraries and founded black library schools the opinion of many northerners and southerners was that blacks could and should go to black library schools and work in black libraries with black patrons another practical reason is that membership and participation in the ala are not mandatory for practice of the profession so the number of blacks would be further diminished with a lack of motivation to join the association but blacks did belong to and participate in ala and the association position on integration and race relations was often tested thomison documents some of the race problems in his history of the american library association   for example in  the richmond virginia conference site posed a special problem state law required black and white separation and blacks could not stay in hotels or eat meals where whites did some white librarians protested once they learned of these conditions and angry spring 
  journal of education for library and information science letters were published in library journal ala council passed a resolution that was weak and avoided the larger issue of racial discrimination it was stated that the general social problem of racial discrimination was not the responsibility of the association to solve attempts to skirt the issue were achieved by holding conferences in the north but northern conferences presented special problems too certain hotels in northern cities did not permit blacks to stay and many northern restaurants did not seat blacks for example the palmer house and the drake hotel of chicago did not house blacks but this did not stop the ala from holding meetings there and this left southern librarians to question northern shock at racial separation in  the conference in cincinnati posed problems in that cincinnati is a city of southern attitude in a northern location also the  toothless resolution on discrimination was being reconsidered a special committee was charged to determine whether any southern hotels or conventions could meet the ala contract which protected members from racial discrimination this announcement in the march  ala bulletin set off an exchange of letters by the membership those who thought the  resolution reconsideration unnecessary cited racial discrimination as inevitable and the customs of the south legitimate and not the concern of the membership i wonder that one can become so excited over a condition which has existed does exist and doubtless will exist so long as there are different racial characteristics are accommodations for the colored members cited at headquarters the way the type is set it reads that they will find accommodations three miles away from the headquarters and the auditorium dissenters were astonished that there was to be any reconsideration of the  resolution and suggested that the membership subscribe to the  conference themes of democracy and freedom ann arbor michigan librarians organized and signed petitions opposed to discrimination one librarian strongly stated that there was to be no pro or con about this matter  that there is only one central indisputable fact namely that every single member of the association has the unarguable incontestable    right to equal treatment in every aspect of his or her membership in the ala those who thought that the resolution was unfair to southern cities mentioned how other associations were held in the south without problem but they failed to recognize that these were segregated associations american bar association american medical association american nursing association etc racial discrimination persisted in ala and instances of discrimination certainly do not end with these two examples a statement on individual and institutional membership as well as chapter status was adopted by ala in  but it was so flimsy and ineffectual that segregation in southern chapters remained an issue this statement circumvented striking down the notion of segregated chapters by placing emphasis on personal conduct for racial harmony the controversy with segregated state associations and ala allowance of these segregated chapters continued through  a year after passage of the civil rights act a library journal editorial on the first integrated meeting of the alabama library association and the good news that the georgia library association had admitted a negro librarian mr e j josey to volume  number
