 the library quarterly their decisions are the result of their acquired training with minimal influence from other external sources harris debunks the ingenuousness of this notion by pointing out that libraries are just one of a number of institutional filters through which cultural productions must pass   prior to reaching a ublic  p  these filters arranged according to a hierarchical power scale begin with the creators writers followed by the producers publishers reviewers published book reviewers university professors the institutional consumer identified specifically as bookstores libraries and educational institutions and finally the reader while the placement of libraries on the penultimate rung demonstrates the role of the library as a conduit between on the one hand the creators and producers of books and on the other hand the reading public it also indicates the process through which librarians themselves have their information filtered this filtering process is especially evident in the relationship between collection development and canon formationthe process whereby authors become recognized or valued as standard  p  harris describes the confluence of the collection development and canon formation processes in terms of the frames  endorsed by the creators and producers of high culture that librarians use to select materials  p  these frames consist of tools such as review media book lists and university reading lists that both reflect and perpetuate the canonical status quo created by the institutional filters positioned above the library that is the publishers and reviewers the use and implication of frames in academic libraries has been documented for instance byjohn doherty who explains how these institutions are positioned to imaintain the supremacy of the canon through the traditional definition of the role of the academic library as a support to the academic curriculum  p  here the specific frame used by the librarian is course curricula and syllabi of a particular college or university by following a collection development policy that is by necessity determined by the academic priorities of each department and unit that the libraries serve the academic library reinforces the dominant and many would argue hegemonic ideology of the academy  p  or what marlene manoff refers to as the elite heritage of the university  p  mark cyzyk notes that the same situation arises with the development and evaluation of library collections by subject specialists explaining that such individuals are both a product of and a contributor or potential contributor to the established canon  p  the role of course curricula and subject specialists in turn is reinforced through the use of another type of frame book lists developed by the library community as collection development and evaluation

the politics of standard selection guides  our decisions about who or what gets represented in our collections plays a role in determining what kind of individual and collective identities are authorized or legitimated  pp   these collecting decisions are subject to and ultimately the product of the series of nested institutional filters described by harris  through which print culture ultimately reaches the library user the result is that the exclusion of peoples or perspectives from the canon also excludes for the most part these same people and perspectives from the library collection since the frames through which libraries select materials are the product of the same forces that initially determined the canon these frames are not limited to course curricula and syllabi but also include book lists used exclusively within the library community to support this curriculum for example connaway examined the representation of women in books for college libraries bcl using the norton anthology of literature by women nalw as a benchmark she notes that although  percent of the authors included in nalware also included in bcl the findings indicate that  percent of the women excluded from the library field canon are unconventional members of society rather than the societal norm  p  while the discussion of the role of libraries in canon production and reproduction often centers on an academic or literary canon librarians utilize a number of other forms of frames such as review media in their collection development approaches as with scholarly canons these frames are endorsed by individuals or institutions with the means of dictating cultural standards in this case the producers and reviewers within the broader realm of mainstream media while the protagonists and context might differ the result of the process is nonetheless identical namely that various institutional filters influence the choices libraries make in their collection development plans some of these filters are more obvious than others although there is at first glance an ever growing number of media options everything from books and magazines to films and interactive web sitesthis wide range constitutes an illusion of options jeffrey chester and gary larson note that there are more media outlets than ever before but this numerical growth as consumers union has pointed out as not been accompanied by a comparable growth of independent diversely owned    media voices  p  as a recent issue of the nation dedicated to the topic of big media makes clear this paucity of diverse voices can be traced to the stranglehold that ten media conglomerates have on the marketplace  collectively the big ten dominate the production and distribution of such formats as movies books sports music television radio magazines entertainment venues and the internet the murdoch controlled news corporation for
 the library quarterly example encompasses harpercollins publishers the new york post twentieth century fox fox news channel tv guide and the new york knicks to name just a few viacom owns cbs the movie channel simon  schuster paramount pictures and blockbuster video the diversity of formats and venues in the conglomerates holdings make possible what robert mcchesney describes as vertical integration meaning that media firms would not only produce content but would also own the distribution channels that would guarantee places to display and market their wares  p  examples of vertical integration abound janine jaquet summarizes a report by the project for excellence in journalism which found that morning network news shows spent  percent of their air time selling something on average  percent of the stories were for books movies tv shows music or products their company produced  p  in fact the synergy that characterizes vertical integration applies not only to marketing media products but developing their content as well as mcchesney explains media conglomerates are risk averse and continually return to what has been commercially successful in the past there is little incentive in the system to develop public taste over time  p  emphasis in original at the same time the opportunities for diverse fare reaching the public are limited precisely because the independent companies most likely to produce it do not have the crossselling and cross promotional opportunities of the media giants  p  the problem of market censorship is also evident in the world of publishing andre schiffrin who left pantheon shortly after it was subsumed by random house which is now owned by bertelsmann to start the new press notes that in  the top twenty publishers accounted for  percent of sales and the ten largest had  percent of revenues  p  these figures are all the more astounding considering that  entities are still recognized by the library of congress as publishers and that  percent of those or  are substantial enough to be recognized by the association of american publishers  p  along with the disproportionate distribution of sales among a small number of firms comes a similarly disproportionate representation of firms within the pages of reviewing media schiffrin observes that the new york times book review of the s was sixtyfour pages longtwice the length of the current sunday section  p  and reviewed books by hundreds of publishing houses a fact which meant that the infrastructure of small publishing houses and independent bookstores and book clubs that existed in the s was capable of reaching a very large audience effectively  p 
the politics of standard selection guides  conversely small independent presses operating in the s and s often do not have the financial resources and cross promotional opportunities to promote their publications in the manner of publishing houses owned by the big ten a company such as random house not only has a ready made advertising market in the magazines and book clubs owned by its parent company bertelsmann but also has vast advertising budgets at its disposal enormous sales forces and an extremely efficient network of press contacts all of which helps ensure that their books get a certain amount of attention  p  the consolidation of publishing operations within media conglomerates also affects the content of what gets published by the major presses since the media conglomerates are equally adverse to risk in the book trade emphasis is placed on acquiring and publishing titles that are predicted to sell in high volume at the same time publishers have been forced to abandon the practice whereby blockbuster titles could cover any losses incurred by less profitable ones as schiffrin explains the policy is now that each book should make money on its own and that one title should no longer be allowed to subsidize another  p  each title is expected to be in financial terms a profit center since the marketplace usually favors established writers or tried and true concepts major publishing houses will often no longer take a chance on more controversial subjects or the time to cultivate unknown authors who do not come with a ready audience the result is a significantly decreased and homogenized range of options the interconnection of corporate synergy market censorship and profit centers thus constitutes another form of institutional filter through which cultural materials pass before reaching the library the books that are finally chosen by libraries have in effect already been chosen by others who have financial and corporate influence book reviews in library journals are not exempt from such structural considerations although the review approaches of libratyjournal and choice are as john calhoun summarizes  pp   meticulous and balanced the review process does not exist in a vacuum but rather is subject to the same influences that inform the canon formation process nancy kranich for example observes that fewer than  titles are reviewed each year most of which are published by fewer than  publishers the largest publishers and that often absent from the review media standard bibliographic tools and conference exhibits are the alternative small andor independent publishers  pp  according to byron anderson one such tool the best books list in the bowker annual library and book trade had only four
 the library quarterly out of a total of  titles published by alternative presses that were profiled in the alternative publishers of books in north america th ed   p  the myriad factors that inform the canon formation process also call into question the idea that collection development guides such as the plc simply reflect the selection of books by consensus of professional judgement  p  to be sure the professional judgment of librarians is involved but that professional judgment only occurs after a long line of other types of contingent judgments has been rendered the recommendations made by such collection development tools as the plc are for all intents and purposes just as contingent as the corporate and financial decisions about which books to publish and which books to promote heavily just as the universe of total books available is on a primary level filtered shaped and ultimately limited by the decisions of large corporate publishers acting on the basis of their own unique institutional pressures collection development tools operating on a secondary or even tertiary level filter shape and ultimately limit the range of options available for libraries by arbitrarily determining a canon that as the present study demonstrates has numerous shortcomings case study of the public library catalog graduate students in a library and information science lis program at a major north american university taking an elective course called collection development and evaluation in fall  were given a course assignment where they were asked to select a subject area in which they had some expertise and using their knowledge of this subject area to comment on the plc list of recommended books on the chosen topic no claim is made that the students are authorities in their chosen fields rather they may be considered to be subject experts who have either recently completed a university degree in their chosen field or have a strong personal interest in the selected topic eligible subject areas were to have no fewer than three and no more than twenty tides listed in the plc students began by identifying which books were listed in the plc for their subject using the index to the eleventh edition published in  as well as the indexes in the  and  plc supplements they next examined both the annotated entries for these titles in the plc and actual physical copies of the books the first part of their written assignments consisted of their analyses of the plc selections including their determination of what points of view approaches and perspectives were not included in this list in addition
the politics of standard selection guides  students were asked to recommend three to seven titles published before  that they felt should have been included in the plc and to write a briefjustification for each of their recommendations students were asked to confine themselves to pre  imprints because later books would not have been available to plc compilers when they were creating the plc eleventh edition and its  and  supplements twenty three students submitted essays that fulfilled all the criteria for this assignment the twenty three subject areas cover an eclectic variety of topics ranging from rap music to zen buddhism to medieval civilization to chemistry table  contains a complete list of subject areas chosen by students a content analysis was then made of the submitted assignments of the twenty three students in order to identify predominant themes and issues across the twenty three different subject areas they examined the name of each subject area as listed in the plc index as well as a list of the plc recommended titles and student recommended titles for each subject are presented in a series of tables tables   for table  subjecr areas in the public library catalog plc examined by students student subject area a personality b classical mythology c china foreign relations united states d chemistry e homeless persons f great britain history   g rap music h russian english dictionaries i zen buddhism j sociobiology k organic gardening l medieval civilization m social change n rhetoric  drugs and nonprescription drugs p fossil hominids q environmental policy united states r france history  revolution s jewish holidays t christian theology u motion pictures history and criticism v mineralogy w korean war

the politics of standard selection guides  of the plc titles means that a number of theoretical frameworks that construct the field of environmental policy are not addressed identifying two of these frameworks as the economics of environmental policy and civic environmentalism student q recommends environmental economics an elementary introduction by r kerry turner david w pearce and ian bateman as well as dewitt john civic environmentalism alternatives to regulation in states and communities to fill these gaps in the plc the concept of civic environmentalism defined as the involvement of citizens communities and businesses working in partnership with government to design their own solutions to environmental problems close to home rather than accepting top down legislation from federal or state regulators  pp   is an especially important lacuna another example of this phenomenon was student v who discussed mineralogy see table  student v believed that while the plc provides many books that contain illustrations photographs and drawings of different minerals gems and rocks throughout the world  as well as crystallography home laboratory techniques fossils manuals and glossaries  p  it lacks titles that discuss the relationship of minerals to important life processes for example he noted that the biological and medical implications of minerals in humans or animals are not included in the plc  p  in addition the plc lacks titles about minerals applied to plants economic aspects industrial processes that is extraction and mining environmental that is toxicity and law lunar mineralogy and minerals in soil  p  according to student v libraries that follow only the plc recommendations would get a very myopic view of the world of mineralogy and he therefore recommends such titles as inside mining the economics of the supply and demand of minerals and metals screening and surveillance of workers exposed to mineral dust and mineral nutrition of higher plants conversely some students felt that the plc list for their subject area could be improved by including books that did not treat the topic in such a general manner one example is the subject of organic gardening examined by student k see table  this individual found that the thirteen titles on the plc list including a number from the wellrecognized rodale press are all good reference books written or compiled by experts in the field and based on sound gardening principles  p  yet student k also points out gardening is not a subject that will always benefit from a general approach an experienced gardener may be able to find the information heshe needs in the encyclopaedic format favoured by so many gardening books but the beginner may well be confused  p  in fact all but two of the plc recommended books follow the type of encyclopedic format found in works such as rodale all new encyclopedia of organic gardening

the politics of standard selection guides  assume a very pro capitalist stance  p  see table  specifically these seven books fail to address populist humanist or socialist perspectives she links this shortcoming to the fact that five of the seven plc titles are by the same two authorsjohn naisbitt of megatrends fame and alvin toffler whose books regard individuals as inactive recipients of change as responders rather than agents  p  student m therefore advises expanding the range of authors in order to provide readers with a broader range of theoretical perspectives including john isbister promises not kept the betrayal of social change in the third world which offers a complex and nuanced reading that looks at historical capitalist imperatives that created the conditions under which many countries still struggle today  p  and paula allman revolutionary social transformation democratic hopes political possibilities and critical education which draws on the intellectual developments of friere and gramsci to propose social transformation rooted in a broad definition of education as cultural action and political thought  pp   student n found that books recommended by the plc on rhetoric define this topic in the mold of william strunk the elements of style focusing on the mechanics of writing style such as principles of clear and concise writing and rules of correctness of usage  p  missing from the plc are books that deal with rhetoric as social interaction  p  discuss the cognitive elements of the writing process and treat writing as a discovery and growing process rather than presenting prescriptive guidelines for people to follow  p  finally student w observed that books recommended by the plc about the korean war concentrated almost exclusively on the political and military background and causes of this conflict from an american perspective  p  see table  missing were books that discussed the international flavor of the war the cultural and artistic legacy of the war and its unfinished nature as manifested in the unification movement of the two koreas the student therefore recommended such works as blood on the hills the canadian army in the korean war a guide to films on the korean war retrieving bones stories and poems of the korean war and korea and its futures unification and the unfinished war see table  both the organic gardening and rhetoric examples seem to indicate an emphasis within the plc list on titles that address the more practical or problem solving aspects of these topics as opposed to books that take a more philosophical approach in essence these topics are constructed within the plc according to books designed to answer the question of how to without necessarily delving into the historical or theoretical questions of why this was also the case with the plc selections on the topic ofjewish holidays see table  student s noted

 the library quarterly that five of the nine titles cited were cookbooks such as marlene sorosky fast and festive meals for the jeunsh holidays and the new york times passover cookbook she explained that the cookbooks while providing brief background information  do not significantly add to a reader knowledge of these holidays  p  moreover she discovered that the noncookbook titles mentioned by the plc all are written from a conservative or borderline conservative orthodox judaic perspective therefore the plc books do not adequately cover the broad spectrum ofjewish religious observance which can be roughly divided into three streams orthodox conservative and reform  p  the student recommends including not only more informative sources but also sources that represent each of the three judaic streams the idea that by defining a subject area according to a single theme or facet the plc does not significantly add to a reader knowledge of a subject area is discussed by student g as well see table  this individual examined the five titles recommended on the subject of rap music she found that with the exception of tricia rose black noise the remaining four books construct a perspective of rap music through eye pleasing design and use of hip language  p  that is geared toward adolescents in the process the student explains the popular consumerist driven idea of rap music as all dope sound system and fly gear is reinforced  p  while the music substantive content and its image of a politically conscious subculture is ignored  p  student j observes that the problem of equating a subject or field of study with a single facet or theory has implications not only for how that subject area is defined but also for the connections made between a subject and other fields of study examining the titles on sociobiology listed in the plc he concludes that all three books make a general claim that human behaviour and social organization reflect a biological imperative  p  see table  in addition to presenting a rather limited scope of the scientific principles underlying sociobiology  p  the fact that all three works espouse similar theories has implications beyond this field studentj points out that the political conclusions taken from sociobiological research must also be addressed  p  citing the example of matt ridley the origin of virtue human instincts and the evolution of cooperation which was recommended by the plc addressing the issue of cooperation from a darwinian perspective ridley proposes a view of human society based on government non interference and a reliance on private sector and free market principles  p  there is a risk then that books endorsing the concept of human behavior as genetically driven would follow neo conservative philosophy which is supported by social darwinist
the politics of standard selection guides  thought which is itself grounded in sociobiology  p  to counter this studentj recommends including in the plc a book such as vaulting ambition sociobiology and the quest for human nature by philip kitcher which calls into question many of the more popular sociobiological claims about humans while addressing methodological problems with the field and   general difficulties involved with attempting to apply a natural sciences paradigm to the study of human and social behaviour  p  in addition kitcher book has the virtue of posing some challenging questions regarding the ideological assumptions inherent in many cientific programs questions that are all the more important because science has often been used to defend the status quo and has acted as an instrument of social control as in the field of eugenics  p  titles such as this one exhibit a healthy skepticism about the tenets of sociobiology thus providing a balance to the pro sociobiological approach to human behaviour  p  that studentj detects in the plc titles missing voices rather than the absence of theories or facets of a topic some students identified missing voices a lack of representation of specific groupswithin the books recommended by the plc the issues raised by these students echo a number of criticisms that surface in the literary canon debate students r and t for example encountered very few books that either were written by or were about women in the context of the topics they examined student r describes the plc books on the french revolution as similar to most histories of the revolution in that they only briefly mention any contributions that women made  p  or tend to focus instead on queen marie antoinette see table  student r therefore recommends adding linda kelly women of the french revolution to the plc kelly book examines what women were trying to accomplish  what rights they lost and why their movement failed to improve things as much as they wanted to by looking at events through the eyes of different women who witnessed the events firsthand  p  student t who looked at the plc recommendations for christian theology notes that these books do not provide a feminist perspective on the topic see table  she remarks that the theologians represented in volumes such as great thinkers of the western world and great christian thinkers are for the most part  dead white male european catholics or lutherans and in some cases are now considered quite orthodox  p  missing from these collected writings are the voices of women theologians or spiritual writers the student did find a better representation from the four titles under the heading

 the library quarterly of women religious life including sherry ruth anderson the feminine face of god and wise women over two thousand years of spiritual writing ly women these titles however were not cross referenced with the christian theology heading furthermore student t still noted a dearth of information on feminist theology ecofeminism and liberation theology  p  she proposes then that the plc include books such as feminist theology a reader and an a to z of feminist theology in order to provide users with a feminist perspective on christian theology in fact the call for a feminist perspective is not limited to the social sciences but extends to the natural sciences as well student j for example suggests adding lynda birke women feminism and biology the feminist challenge to the plc list of books on the topic of sociobiology see table  he explains that this work is one of the few books that offers a feminist critique of sociobiology  p  with birke delineating a connection between the political motivations of scientific research and the subordinate roles traditionally assigned to women in addition to downplaying the role or contributions of women in various fields some students also characterized the books listed in the plc as having a decidedly western bent student l found this to be the case with the plc tides on medieval civilization to avoid having an abundance of books offering only a western christian male centric exploration of the middle ages  p  she recommends that the plc include titles that cover each of the following areas women in the middle ages islamic and jewish civilizations in the middle ages and eastern civilizations in the middle ages  pp   indeed a number of students mentioned that the plc titles for given subject areas were lacking a global perspective student e and student q each came to this conclusion regarding the subject areas of homeless persons and united states environmental policy while both of these topics center on problems and policies in the united states each student contends that these issues need to be examined within a broader globalized context student e states that the plc list on homeless persons could benefit from the inclusion of irene glasser homelessness in global perspective which provides data and surveys from numerous regions around the world and brings to light the similarities of the problem globally  pp   see table  similarly student q observes that environmental problems are trans national and that one country policies will affect not only their own nation but also the global community  p  concluding that the plc coverage of united states environmental policy could be improved by including what is happening around the world she recommends the book from promises to performance achieving global environmental goals by gary
the politics of standard selection guides  bryner which discusses the challenges that are involved in preserving the global environment table  some students identified missing voices in the context of specific debates within a field of study one example is student c who analyzed the plc recommendations on the topic of china foreign relationsunited states see table  she explains that the five books recommended by the plc primarily focus on the factors that influenced the development of united states foreign policy toward china the prob lem however is these works largely ignore the chinese perspective  p  in order to remedy this problem she suggests that the plc include foreign relations of the people republic of china by john w garver garver she notes attempts to look at sino american relations from a chinese perspective by using chinese sources such as writings of major chinese political figures  p  she also recommends adding after the cold war domestic factors and uschina relations a title that is the result of collaboration between academics in the united states and china as another means of reducing bias and error  p  student u also observed a bias toward the american perspective in the plc recommendations in this case in the context of books on the subject of motion pictures history and criticism see table  in particular he observes that the plc list is dedicated almost exclusively to the history of american film and eschews works of criticism and theory that take issue with the traditional american view of motion pictures by short shrifting the critical works in favour of those historical the compositors of the plc have avoided ideological challenges an act which is in itself ideological  p  critical and theoretical works he continues show that there is more than one way the established way ofjudging films  p  concentrating on the history of film risks losing the personal idiosyncratic and visionary aspects of film criticism at a time when the art of film as well as criticism has become soullessly technologised  p  authority closely related to the issue of missing voices is the authority of those whose work is endorsed by the plc student f would like to see more primary sources recommended on the topic of victorian britain arguing that contemporaneous works are essential for an understanding of any historical period  p  see table  student a questions the credentials of an author represented on the plc list for the subject of personality citing the example of the plc recommended title reading people she explains that the author jo ellan dimitrius
 the library quarterly offers an approach to making judgements about people based on their appearance and actions that was formed during her years of observation as a jury consultant  p  see table  the student contends however that dimitrius offers no theoretical basis for judgements and that the book certainly shouldn be called psychology and it really isn about personality either  p  in other instances students questioned the authority of those represented in the plc by citing the credentials of other authors they felt should have been included student u for example registers surprise that the works of graham greene james agee and sergei eisenstein are not included in the plc list of books on motion pictures history and criticism describing these three individuals as not only great critics but also great practitioners  p  when recommending john garver work on united states chinese relations student c commends the fact that garver is fluent in chinese and travels in the far east frequently  p  see table  she goes on to comment that his knowledge in chinese affairs far exceeds some american diplomats who do not even know the language and only travel to china occasionally for short periods  p  underscoring the student praise of garver work and implicit criticism of the plc titles is the idea that a writer authority on a subject stems in part from his or her status within or connection to the group community or nation being examined this issue is also raised in student g critique of the titles on the subject of rap music see table  she notes for example that plc recommended hip hop america by nelson george aims to bridge the languagecultural gap experienced by an individual outside the hip hop culture  p  the problem however is twofold first by aiming to reach readers outside of this culture george work does not meet the information needs of individuals already part of the culture who are interested in furthering their knowledge  p  in fact student g points out that the information needs of this group are not adequately addressed by any of the works listed in the plc at the same time george himself often misuses terms  p  signifying his own status as someone outside of the culture he discusses while not suggesting that only members of the hip hop culture possess the authority to write about this subject student g does raise the point that those who are part of the culture offer a unique and valuable perspective that should be represented in the plc the match between title and topic to be sure not all students found that the plc lacked key perspectives or voices in a given subject area student i for example commends
the politics of standard selection guides  the plc for striving to achieve a balance in the books listed under the topic of zen buddhism see table  he observes that these four titles could be assigned to the following categories the historyphilosophy of zen zen practice and zen literature  p  thereby providing a comprehensive overview of the subject area in addition he writes that the plc recognized the need for mixed perspectives and interpretations of zen by including equal number of works by eastern and western writers  p  interestingly while the majority of students faulted the overall representation of perspectives and voices representing their subject area in the plc student i felt that the major facets of his topic were well covered his praise however extends only to how the subject area is structured categorically rather than to the specific titles selected for each of these facets he writes as much as i can agree with the set up of the plc list i have to totally disagree with the choice of books that were applied to the three chosen categories these books excluding essential zen do not match the standards established by the plc editor  pp   more specifically the books in some cases do not actually match the subject area to which they were assigned he provides the example of the snow leopard by peter matthiessen arguing that it has nothing to do with zen buddhism  p  instead he describes it as a travel memoir  p  of a journey the author made to nepal in  with matthiessen reflecting on an extensive number of topics from observations of fauna and flora of the himalayan mountains to  his exposure to a new culture  p  and while buddhism is a part of this culture the student feels that characterizing the snow leopard as being about zen buddhism is misleading in fact student i was not alone in pointing out the frequently problematic relationship between a particular subject area and the plc titles meant to represent that topic student a comment that jo ellan dimitrius reading people certainly shouldn be called psychology and it really isn about personality either  p  is one such example a second example comes from student p who in examining the recommended books on fossil hominids notes that milford wolpoff race and human evolution fundamentally  is not about fossil hominids characterizing it instead as a historical examination of race theory in paleoanthropology  p  the need for a comprehensive framework concluding that the plc overemphasized particular theories or perspectives while excluding others students offered a number of solutions to this problem some felt that the plc should include more titles
 the library quarterly that could provide the reader with either an overview of or contextual framework for a given topic the idea would be to furnish readers with a historical or theoretical grounding before they tackled the more specific theories and topics discussed but not necessarily contextualized in the books recommended by the plc at the same time the reader would gain a more complete picture of how a field or subject area has evolved and would be introduced to the various individuals who have contributed to its development observing that the plc does not offer a comprehensive theoretical framework for the subject of personality but rather bits and pieces  p  student a suggests that an undergraduate level textbook on personality development be included the plc list offers little historical background for the development of various theories and no overarching works that look at all the areas presently being studied  p  she explains that a textbook such as personality an integrated approach by stephen mayer and karen sutton would not only offer a more integrated overview of personality  p  than the plc recommended books but would also be more accessible to those who do not have previous training in psychology  p  see table  in addition she notes that this text would contextualize for the reader the individual theories set forth in plc titles such as becoming basic considerations for a psychology of personality by gordon allport which she describes as a seminal work in the field of personality development  p  yet while allport book deserves a place in any library  p  student a stresses that it needs to be balanced with titles that explain how such seminal works fit into the framework of personality theory  p  the idea of supplementing plc recommended titles with textbooks geared toward undergraduates was also proposed by student d this individual found seven titles listed under the subject of chemistry one of which is a dictionary two of which are under the plc supplied category tables with the remaining four listed under history see table  while describing the history of chemistry as important the student also notes that it isjust one area of the extensive field of chemistry prompting him to characterize the preponderance of books with a historical focus as unjustified  p  specifically he explains that books such as hugh salzberg from caveman to chemist circumstances and achievements which traces the history of chemistry from prehistoric time to the year   p  and the norton history of chemistry tend to refer to chemical terms and concepts while providing the reader with only very sketchy and often confusing explanations of these concepts  p  the result therefore is that it would be very difficult for those who are not familiar with these concepts to get a sense of what they are about  pp   at the same time
the politics of standard selection guides  the two titles listed under tables in the plc the crc handbook of chemistry and physics and lange handbook of chemistry consist primarily of conversion and physical constant tables leading student d to comment that such data is of little use to someone who has no knowledge of the underlying principles  p  student d solution is to include in the plc a comprehensive text such as david oxtoby and norman nachtrieb principles of modern chemistry that introduces many of the most basic principles of chemistry  p  another approach suggested by students for incorporating a wider range of perspectives on a topic is to add to the plc list books that compile a variety of viewpoints or theories for example in order to present a more balanced view of the field of sociobiology student j recommends the sociobiology debate explaining that this volume includes essays by over thirty people in the field  p  including authors found on the plc sociobiology list see table  the fact that these essays run the gamut from charles darwin to stephen jay gould enables the reader not only to be exposed to a variety of schools of thought within the field but also to get a sense of the evolution of the theories themselves and the historical context in which they were developed likewise student p who examined the plc recommended titles on the topic of fossil hominids notes that this field is rife with internal debates for example the eternal umpers versus splitters schism  over how many fossil species there are how to name them and how to arrange family trees  p  yet the books recommended by the plc either ignore these debates or present only one side of them to remedy this situation student p suggests including bones of contention controversies in the search for human origins by roger lewin a book that highlights key figures and their conflicts with one another  to show how the field operates  p  he concludes that the advantage of having this book in the library would be to demonstrate that the contents of the other books are nowhere near as clear cut as some of them would have you believe  p  similarly student r proposes adding the french revolution conflicting interpretations to the plc because this book gives readers a chance to easily compare the way different historians interpret ten different important events of the french revolution  p  usability striking a balance between scholarly and accessible titles underlying the idea of providing readers with a contextual framework on a subject area is a recognition that the plc needs to strike a balance
 the library quarterly between scholarly and accessible treatments of these topics student i for example characterizes daisetz teitero suzuki the manual of zen which is recommended by the plc as focusing mainly on materials related to monastic life that  percent of potential readers would not be able to follow or even understand  p  he continues suzuki works in general are directed to experienced zen students and are highly specialized in one specific and very narrow aspect of zen each time which require s from the reader a wide ranging understanding of buddhist doctrines and concepts  pp   in her discussion of the plc titles on the subject of rap music student g suggests that librarians develop specific categories to aid in the collection development process she offers the following categories as guidelines reference works history cultural criticism political ideology and biography following these categories would on the one hand produce a more balanced picture of rap music one that does not as is the case with the plc coverage overlook rap music role as a resistance cultural transmission mode  p  and a form of political ideology on the other hand the student also explains that collecting according to these categories would ensure that a beginner will not be overwhelmed with contradictory or overly scholarly information and that a serious researcher will not have to sift through fanzine like information  p  such as the preponderance of who who type materials listed in the plc indeed the specific titles that the student recommends for each of her categories reflect this goal see table  in the reference works category which she defines as material that contains current information about the language lyrical development and styles of rap music  p  she includes fresh fly flavor words and phrases of the hiphop generation which offers a comprehensive glossary of more than four hundred rap terms and african american musical idioms  p  while fresh fly flavor would especially benefit the novice reader geneva smitherman black talk words and phrases from the hood to the amen corner delves even further into the definitions etymology parts of speech and usage  p  of the vocabulary of rap music and its lyrical development and would therefore be especially useful for those conducting in depth research on the subject student h points out that addressing information needs at multiple levels is especially imperative in the case of dictionaries examining the russian englishenglish russian dictionaries recommended by the plc she concludes that they would be of great help to linguists specialists of literature or individuals with an intermediate knowledge of both languages looking for a translation of a single word or phrase  p  see table  notably absent from this list however are tools
the politics of standard selection guides  that are geared toward the beginner or novice speaker citing the example of collin concise oxford russian dictionary she explains that most of the information related to the use of grammar or pronunciation    requires previous knowledge about phonetics or some basics in comparative grammar  p  in addition the dictionaries in the plcdo not always indicate how words assume different connotations in various contexts her solution is to include the oxford starter russian dictionary in the plc which in addition to standard definitions provides examples from contemporary real life  p  of how words are used as well as tables and guides for declensions and conjugations and pronunciation  p  in fact the need to balance advanced level and accessible works in the case of dictionaries concerns not only the linguistic level of the intended user but also the dictionary emphasis on colloquial versus more formal usage of the language one particularly vivid example provided by student h concerns the random house russian english dictionary of idioms which attempts to show words in context in colloquial russian  p  the dictionary while presenting idiomatic expressions does so using literary examples from works of pushkin tolstoy dostoyevsky chekhov solzhenitsyn and others  p  the student comments few would agree that the phraseology and terminology of solzhenitsyn not to mention the classical writers of the nineteenth century is the colloquial or idiomatic language of the russian population at the beginning of the st century this is a proper formal and literary language and it is not used as everyday communication  p  in addition she noticed that only two of the seven plc recommended dictionariesthe penguin russian dictionary and the oxford english russian dictionary include any words or phrases that could be characterized as slang she points out that slang defined as common colloquial expressions can serve as a bridge between literary and everyday contemporary language  p  the exclusion of slang from the recommended dictionaries means that the relationship between language and culture remains largely unexplored especially because slang and colloquialisms are used in everyday expressions as well as in professional life for instance in journalism politics business banking culture ballet music  and there is a constant use and development of slang among specific groups such as youth schools universities sports army etc  p  a work specifically and extensively dealing with slang such as the dictionary of slang and colloquial expressions should therefore be part of the plc list moreover student h points out that none of the dictionaries recommended by the plc would be of much use to highly skilled professionals  p  because the technical lexicon is limited and of second
 the library quarterly ary importance so much so that the stoddart visual dictionary by jeanclaude corbeil   provides more entries on scientific and technical information than all the russian english dictionaries recommended by the plc  pp   because much contemporary communication is centered around and makes use of technical terms it is important to have russian english and english russian dictionaries specifically devoted to medical scientific technological and business terminology dictionaries that could be productively used by busy professionals who frequently work with russian documents organizations and individuals in the twenty first century datedness student h criticism that the russian english dictionaries recommended by the plc collectively do not give sufficient weight to contemporary idiomatic and technical expressions introduces the issue of datedness a number of students found that the plc titles for their topic area seemed out of date for instance student i writes about alan watts the way of zen as follows when his book was published in  it was most likely one of the best books on zen on the market  p  he notes however that numerous works on zen buddhism have been published since that time books that outshine watts and that present a vivid contrast to his way too shallow analysis and too scholarly explanations  p  in some cases the datedness of the plc list was linked to the overemphasis of a particular type of book or topic within a given subject area student g for instance notes that the who who type of book found on the plc list of books on rap music becomes quickly outdated students k and n observe that the plc does not adequately cover new areas of research in the fields they chose to examine student k for instance notes that in general the books on the plc list all assume a middle of the road approach to gardening because t hey meet the needs of the average gardener who has decided to avoid the use of chemicals and where the end result is still recognizably what everyone would agree is a garden a plot of land designed and controlled by a gardener  p  as an antidote to this middle of the road approach she provides the example of the naturalistic movement in organic gardening which moves beyond the domain of a chemical and pesticide free garden to challenge the notion of what exactly constitutes a garden she explains that the hallmarks of this approach include the use of native plants and wildflowers a move away from formal garden design and a strong emphasis on environmental concerns
the politics of standard selection guides   p  none of the plc books however address this subject similarly student n felt that because of its narrow definition of rhetoric as simply the mechanics of writing the plc does not reflect the new trend in rhetorical studiesnamely the focus on the role of invention in the writing process  p  she concludes that the plc list could be modified by adding some of the books that reflect the development of rhetorical studies in the th century  p  tools and formatting for many students the discussion of the usability of the plc recommended titles focused on the specific tools or features that the books did or did not provide student b who examined the plc titles on the subject of classical mythology notes that the contents of these books are arranged in alphabetical order according to a name or event  p  see table  she explains that this across the board organizational approach limits the usability of these works  p  observing that many individuals including researchers might appreciate the availability of resources that provide access based on topics rather than simply names citing robert bell dictionary of classical mythology symbols attibutes and associations as an example she suggests that the topical approach  p  of this resource would enable individuals to trace particular topics through greek and roman mythology similarly student  notes that the consumer guides included among the plc recommended titles on drugs and nonprescription drugs fail to provide an index that collocates alternate trade names including generic names of various medications  pp   see table  she explains that this greatly diminishes the usefulness of these guides because a user might search in vain for information concerning a particular medication that is listed under an unfamiliar name significantly the tool most frequently identified as missing from the plc recommended books is a list of recommendations for further reading as student l points out in her critique of the plc books on medieval civilization not every book on a given topic can be included in the collection therefore the provision of a bibliography that suggests other sources of information becomes an important consideration  p  student b raises this same point in her discussion about classical mythology books she notes that while the plc recommended encyclopedia of greco roman mythology includes an extensive bibliography it is not the type of tool that readers could use to identify sources  or further readings for particular subjects  p  she concludes that given the variations in these tales it would be especially
 the library quarterly helpful for the plc to include books that indicate the different versions of the myths that exist and include extensive references for more detailed study  p  discussion as quinn points out attempts to make the canon more inclusive often fixate on an insupportable ideal of all inclusiveness he writes that after a certain point literary orth becomes devalued or meaningless as the point of infinite expansion is approached  p  bill katz concurs arguing that the notion that everything is equal  flies in the face of common sense and experience  p  rather than assume an anticanonist perspective that calls for the abolishment of best books lists he suggests that the library community instead should turn its attention to how to modify the lists to meet the needs of specific readers  p  because a standardized list the plc is intended to consolidate within one volume the best books available on particular subjects as determined by consensus of professional judgement  p  the students critiques presented in this study have not only demonstrated particular shortcomings of the plc but also indicated ways to modify it to meet the needs of specific readers  p  many of the specific criticisms such as the exclusion of women and the lack of diversity echo the literary canon debate as judith serebnick and frank quinn point out the professional literature including textbooks on collection development attests to the continuing dominance of quality and demand standards however a diversity standard also is strongly supported  p  indeed the idea that the widest diversity of viewpoints is essential to library collections  p  applies to both the representation of particular groups and the recognition of specific theories and facets within a field students analyses also pinpointed a number of areas where the plc provides an incomplete picture of a subject area either by overlooking or overemphasizing particular topics because the plc is geared toward both public and small undergraduate libraries this problem affects how a field of study is defined as well as local and national research patterns  p  for instance manoff explains that for undergraduates in an introductory psychology course who are writing papers on the impact of birth order on personality formation    the handful of books found on the shelves of the library may well define the field this is especially true for the student who is disinclined to make use of interlibrary loan  p  the implications of this scenario become especially vivid in light of the
the politics of standard selection guides  comments made by student a regarding the lack of a comprehensive framework and overemphasis of particular theories within the plc selected titles on personality development given the effect that collection development choices can have on how a field of study is constructed and the voices that define that field suggestions made by some students of including a comprehensive text or a compendium of theories for a subject area seem valid indeed the recommendation by studentj sociobiology that the plc include books that are skeptical of a field addresses quinn point that true pluralism means that along with unconventional criticism libraries should try to select books that present all sides of the debate   p  while the issue of pluralism is crucial to an evaluation of collection development tools students criticisms about the usability of the plc also should not be overlooked although problems with datedness and formatting fall outside the usual canon debates they nonetheless call into question the notion of the plc as a best books list the concerns that the twenty three students expressed need to be examined not only in terms of the standards that the plc strives to meet but also the fact that the plc is a tool that standardizes library collections as haines writing in  explains in her favorable review of book selection aids these tools operate on the principle that books carefully chosen as desirable for one library of a particular type will be suitable for others of the same general character  p  harris bluntly assesses the potential effects of this principle explaining that librarians across the country are capable of building collections of remarkable uniformity via the use of an extremely limited number of rames in the book selection process  p  quinn in turn has linked this potential for homogeneity to the mcdonaldization process  the term mcdonaldization was developed by sociologist george ritzer to describe the phenomenon whereby services and procedures once subject to the fluctuations of human interaction undergo a rationalization process that emphasizes efficiency predictability calculability and control  ritzer illustrates this process using the fastfood chain modus operandi mcdonaldized systems generally institute routinized procedures in order to control what employees customers and many others eg suppliers do and those procedures exist in order to deal with recurrent situations eg the ordering of goods or services by customers  p  the result is a sense of dehumanization and homogeneity that stems from methods that leave  employees with little or no room for personal decision making  p  although named after the fast food industry ritzer has noted the expansion of the mcdonaldization process to a variety of situations and
 the library quarterly venues including credit cards theme parks and universities in describing what he terms the mcuniversity ritzer explains that as potential students and their parents increasingly adopt a consumerist orientation to higher education by looking at cost quality and convenience when choosing a school  to get the best product for their money universities will meet these demands by instituting the same rationalization procedures that characterize the fast food industry  p  he foresees that at mcuniversities rules regulations systemwide syllabuses and constraints of all types will abound efforts will be made to script rofessors like counter people    through the use of uniform lectures and ancillary materials with emphasis placed on eproducing existing knowledge rather than producing new knowledge  p  quinn has identified the rationalization procedures of efficiency predictability calculability and control specifically within academic libraries at the end of the twentieth century arguing that the concept of predictability is relevant to the collection development aids currently used by these institutions he notes that the collection development process has become more and more standardized resulting in collection content varying less from one library or type of library to another  p  at the same time efficiency plays a role in the mcdonaldization of libraries because rather than attempting to amass vast collections of books and journals the libraries are relying more on ill and document delivery services to supply resources on an as needed basis  p  yet as library collections become more homogenized resources and procedures such as interlibrary loan ill will do little to bring new and varied materials to the user collection development librarians who rely primarily on the plc for selection decisions are in danger of succumbing to this mcdonaldization phenomenon by unhesitatingly accepting plc recommendations and thinking that adherence to such recommendations ensures an adequate collection on any given topic librarians are not only complicit in perpetuating a homogenized collection but also of not examining closely whether a purported best of list has significant lacunae conclusion collection development tools such as the plc have the potential to catalyze the mcdonaldization not only of public libraries but also of small undergraduate libraries although a valuable resource the plc is essentially a checklist whose use or overuse can result in the homogenization of library collections an effect not unlike ritzer mcuni
the politics of standard selection guides  versity scenario where emphasis is placed on reproducing existing knowledge rather than producing new knowledge  p  furthermore the critiques of the plc presented in this study also indicate the potential for creating standardized collections of best books that do not meet the criteria for best accordingly greater emphasis needs to be placed on the evaluation of such collection development tools including the various factors that inform both their creation and use collection development librarians who are purchasing books for specific subject areas should pay more attention to the types of problems present in the plc that have been identified here across a broad range of twenty three subject areas the plc frequently makes recommendations that have an imbalance of perspectives for example missing theoretical perspectives overemphasis of a particular facet or theory within a field missing voices lack authority do not have a close match between recommended title and topic area do not provide a comprehensive framework for the subject area in question and are problematic in terms of their usability for example lack of balance between scholarly and popular titles datedness and format an awareness of such shortcomings in standard collection development tools will help librarians to understand that the process of collection development and evaluation is an intellectual exercise demanding time extensive subject knowledge and critical analytical skills that collection development is not merely a matter of adhering to a recommended checklist references  harris michael h state class and cultural reproduction toward a theory of library service in the united states advances in librarianship      makaryk irena r ed encyclepedia of contemporary literary theory approaches scholars terms toronto university of toronto press   doherty john j the academic librarian and the hegemony of the canon journal of academic librarianship  september     manoff marlene academic libraries and the culture wars the politics of collection development collection management  fall     cyzyk mark canon formation library collections and the dilemma of collection development college  research libraries  january     connaway lynn silipigni an examinationi of the inclusion of a sample of selected women authors in books for college librazries college  research libraries  january     haines helen e living with books the art of book selection d ed new york columbia university press   yaakovjuliette ed public library catalog guide to reference books and adult nonfiction  th ed new york h w wilson
