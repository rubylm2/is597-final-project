the reorganization of the book trade in germany felix reichmann publications control in nazi germany n spite of the pompous messages of dr goebbels who extolled the cultural importance of the profession the german book trade was obstructed in its development during the entire nazi regime the war aggravated these conditions even further the book trade was deprived of almost all foreign information cut off from necessary raw materials throttled by invidious regulations of the nazi kulturkammer and finally sacrificed under the impact of the laws of total war on the already tottering altar of the nazi myth the nazi government which attempted to control the most intimate actions of the german citizens kept the production and distribution of printed material under close surveillance from i on although no official censorship existed for books except for party literature the kulturkammer had the right to bar any offending publisher or author from further professional activities almost every number of the bdrsenblatt fiur den deutschen buchhandel testifies to the frequency with which this right was exercised the strict rationing of paper beginning in i facilitated even further the regulation of the trend of publications the choice of the title and the size of the edition became dependent on governmental approval the next move of the party brought the entire distribution under its control the allotment procedure zuteilungsverfahren wrecked any existing intimate relationship between publisher and dealer ninety per cent of any edition was distributed to the dealers according to an allotment table subject to approval by the kulturkammer the remaining io per cent was at the disposal of the publisher the effects of this regulation were detrimental to the very structure of the german book trade the responsible dealer proud of his book knowledge and selective ability became an impersonal tool with no freedom of professional action publishing became a dry almost mechanical activity to hand over a manuscript selected by the party to a printer and to distribute the finished product to a dealer of the party choice it is not quite clear in what year the book trade was requested to introduce the allotment procedure voluntarily the party publishing houses were already using it before the war and it was universally applied from  on no method of distribution can offset the basic relationship between supply and demand the commercially available german book stock had already reached a low ebb in the summer of  the old stock stored with the dealers was rapidly sold out and the dwindling raw materials did not permit an adequate new production there was left as a last resort the old stock of the publishers many of whom still had a large supply of the less fashionable books but a drastic pulping order issued by the reichsschrifttumskammer in september i cut the trade off from this last resource all publishers were ordered to report immediately how many of their remainders would fall into the following categories x

reorganization of the book trade in germany might be a paragon of nazi ideology on the other hand there were undoubtedly cases where a harmless citizen was browbeaten into joining the party the language difficulties have been almost insurmountable it is not language in its philological sense many members of the branch speak german fluently but language as semantics during the nazi regime many words received a new meaning which differed widely from the formerly accepted usage many incidents can only be explained by the utter language confusion in the minds of the applicants what conception of the word politeness has a man who says to an american official i am always astonished to see how polite you are there is no necessity for you to be polite sie haben es doch nicht notig what connotation has the word jew and what meaning has democracy for men who state in order to prove their democratic mentality i let a jew use my telephone in  or i sold books to jewish customers as willingly as i sold to gentiles what meaning has aggression for a person who criticizes hitler sharply for starting the war but ends with the statement it was surely intolerable to german honor not to throw these dirty poles out of danzig what implication has intellectual responsibility for an editor who tries to excuse his violently antidemocratic editorials by saying in order to show that i did not believe in the things i had to write i did not sign these pieces unfortunately these incidents have not been exceptions but daily occurrences party members membership since i earnestly request to be classified as antinazi because they can produce a severe warning by the party issued because of some infringements of party rules others want preferred treatment because they stopped paying their monthly party dues in the summer of i the human tragedy lies in the fact that many sincerely believe in the justice of their demands and cannot understand why their arguments are not accepted some had simply not had the courage to make a clear stand during the nazi regime they had joined the party under strong pressure and had even made important concessions but they had done so half heartedly had therefore never been fully accepted by the party hierarchy had been treated with suspicion and in some instances had been persecuted but because of their party membership their concessions and contributions to nazi ideology they cannot be classified as anti nazis although some really are sometimes not even as nominal party members it can be stated that the branch has done its very best to render impartial justice in spite of all difficulties a publisher license has not been granted if the applicant had been in any way whatsoever affiliated with the party or its organizations or had made concessions to the goebbels propaganda machine exception to this rule has been made only if active anti nazi activity could be proved books by authors who are compromised by their former activities for the nazi regime cannot be published scholars who have been cleared by other american agencies for teaching at universities for instance are declared acceptable it is the policy of the branch to give first priority of publication to writers who had been barred from professional activities because of their antinazi ideology
 the library quarterly nazi books and similar nationalistic and militaristic literature have been impounded with the exception of books in private libraries the library of congress mission in europe was permitted to select the items they were interested in for distribution among american scholarly libraries through the co operative acquisitions project law  which supersedes all previous instructions on the confiscation of nazi books provides for the safekeeping of a hundred and fifty copies of each title the rest are to be pulped the paper thus gained will be used for the publication of schoolbooks faced by such a complex issue as the reconstruction of the german book trade it has been impossible to avoid mistakes but the branch has never failed to keep its two main objectives clearly in mind to supply the german reading public with books which support the conception of world peace and to promote those german book dealers who are willing to respect human rights and human dignity
