good morning and thank you all for being at this most important conference i appreciate that this is the second in a series of opportunities to talk about the issues of diversity and inclusion and i am grateful to the university of maryland and its fine faculty the ala diversity report american library association  lists a total of  credentialed librarians of whom  are african american and  are latino that means about  of working librarians represent more than  of our population in  we had  librarians of whom  were african american and  latino after  years we had fewer librarians and a smaller percentage of librarians of color even worse there were only  african american males  of the total number of african american librarians in  what is wrong with this picture i am not suggesting that diversity is only about race diversity is not about color gender age language sexual orientation or socioeconomic statusits about all of these things if we dont ensure that our libraries have frontline professionals who reflect the nature of the communities with which they work then we will lose those valuable patrons to the back fence they will turn instead to a neighbor who looks just like them regardless of whether or not they receive valid information from that person this situation doesnt help create a sustainable future for libraries nor does it help build a literate and knowledgeable citizenry encouraging diversity is one of the most important things we do as educational institutions education is really about intellectual diversity looking at things differently sometimes librarians and staff reflect the diversity of the people they serve yet sometimes it seems that we are going backward with fewer librarians from diverse backgrounds i believe that if we take action now we can ensure that in the future our library and information professionals will mirror the people they serve to get us started let me explore five ideas that ive been thinking about first lets discuss the concept of going beyond mere equity of access if we truly want to be inclusive that means every format every type of information should be available anytime to anyone the real issue at the bottom of the iceberg is that diversity without inclusion means nothing every message we construct must say you are welcome here assortment difference distinctiveness medley unlikeness variance variety and variegation are all synonyms for diversity note that not one of these terms includes the concept of quotas or force of any kind diversity is the natural state homogeneity sameness similarity and uniformity are unnatural we want to get to the point where diversity is not an issue and our environments are all inclusive welcoming and based on integrity and justice as stated by the association of american colleges and universities nd inclusion refers to the active intentional and ongoing engagement with diversity in ways that increase ones awareness content knowledge cognitive sophistication and empathic understanding of the complex ways individuals interact within institutions inclusion is the act of creating environments in which any individual or group can feel welcomed respected supported and valued second the methods we use to measure access for and service to specific populations are not adequate we need new tools to tell the story of inclusion for example we dont know the costs of inaccurate information or how lack of access may harm our social structures i think this may be the most difficult challenge we face and i am not sure how we solve it third we need a rationale for change and sometimes it is difficult to effect change academics are not designed to turn on a dime weve worn the same outfits for  years an essential part of what we do as library and information professionals continues to be connecting people with the information that they need it is difficult to train for such a huge range of needs yet we must meet the challenge we must be flexible and better able to adopt new practices fourth we need to grow our own future the best solution i know is to recruit the best and brightest adding sensitivity to diversity to deep understanding of user needs that means recruiting diverse faculty staff and students and then providing an environment of inclusion so they can thrive and survive and that means we need scholarships and support for faculty research in our role as teachers we need to insist that information literacy for everyone be a core requirement and that it include all types of literacy from health and financial to media and political literacy to do this effectively we need a deep understanding of the societal value of diverse populations and the contributions they make to our cultural heritage one way of doing this is to provide internships and service learning opportunities in a variety of environments we cannot underestimate the value of being immersed in a community and providing needed services that match the population served as we grow our own future we need to cultivate future lis faculty with research agendas that deal with issues of inclusion and the value of diverse lis professionals mega subramaniam and paul jaeger are doing a great job at the university of maryland and we need to emulate their strategies my fifth and final suggestion is to develop a common research agenda that will provide longitudinal and impact data lets start with the abcs and build the inclusive research agenda in which a includes research on access attitudes attention and attraction to funders b focuses on best practices for recruitment retention and measuring impact and c concentrates on collections communities and captioning using these abcs we can assess attitudes community needs equity of access needs of our funders and sustainability of policies that create inclusive environments in conclusion diversity recruitment must become a top priority to ensure that our graduates will reflect the populations that they will serve when we get such students we cant risk losing them or not preparing them for jobs that may change by the second with unfunded mandates new technologies for communication and unknown challenges the following are a few images figs  that tell our story in carolina basically they illustrate our diversity and inclusion mantra reflect who you serve plan how to do it do it evaluate it live it have an advisory group have scholarships available provide for the differently abled include local celebrities and the student body and tell everyone every chance you have at state and national events the story of your success figure   provide opportunities for your faculty to be all inclusive figure   keep an active and informed advisory group and listen to it figure   encourage presentations at professional associations figure   build scholarship opportunities at every chance in closing let me say that building an environment that is inclusive and diverse is never finished there are no quotas to fill no numbers to attain when everyone has a voice and the opportunity to share their thoughts it is good so that is my hope for the future what is yours
