community developments and their effect on library planning philip m hauser tibrary planning over the next sev eral decades will necessarily have s to take into account the great changes the nation is now experiencing in population growth distribution and composition and in the physical structures of our metropolitan areas under the impact of two world wars and a great depression within the compass of a single human generation the united states is experiencing basic population and physical changes some of which are reinforcing or accelerating long time trends and some of which represent reversals of them the public library like other agencies and institutions on the contemporary scene must necessarily adapt itself to these developments library planning which may be regarded as a short expression for rational decision making in respect to the future of libraries is a way to effect the accommodation of the library to the changing scene with a minimum of friction and with the greatest possible efficiency to achieve these objectives the library planner must be conversant with the basic changes under way and in prospect let us turn first to a consideration of the basic population changes under way and second to the structural changes in the metropolitan area which have important implications for the library population changes total population growth until the beginning of world war ii the long time trend of total population growth in the united states was definitely downward between  and  the population of the country doubled five times the first three times between  and  it took twentyfive years each time the fourth time between  and  it took thirtyfive years the fifth time the doubling of the population between  and  took fifty years the downward secular trend in rate of national population growth was augmented by the depression in the thirties during which the american birth rate and the rate of population growth reached new lows widely accepted population projections during the  indicated that the united states would reach a maximum population of about  million by the end of the century and remain stationary or decline shortly thereafter  data utilized unless otherwise specified are drawn largely from publications of the united states bureau of the census to prevent a bulky number of footnotes the main sources are indicated below united states bureau of the census statistical abstract of the united states  washington dc government printing office  historical statistics of the united states   washington dc government printing office  continuation to  of historical statistics of the united states   washington dc government printing office  united states census of population  vol ii characteristics of the population part i united states summary washington dc government printing office  revised projections of the population of the united states by age and sex  to  current population reports population estimates series p  no  washington dcj civilian population of the united states by type of residence april  and  current population reports population characteristics series p  no  washington dc  p k whelpton forecasts of the population of the united states  to  washington dc government printing office  p  
 the library quarterly the effects of world war ii and postwar developments however have drastically altered the population prospects of the country the economic boom which has accompanied these developments has produced an upsurge in marriage and fertility unanticipated either in magnitude or in duration in consequence the population of the united states passed the  million mark in  and exceeded  million by june  projections of the united states bureau of the census indicate that the population of the united states will reach a total of about  million by  if the birth rate remains at relatively high levels and a population of at least  million even if the birth rate should drop considerably thus the library which accommodated itself to a national growth of  per cent or  million persons between  and  must be prepared for an increase of up to  million persons per decade between  and  in the short span of twenty five years the library must be prepared for a population increase of from  to  million persons an increase over the period of from  to  per cent an increase of up to  per cent in library facilities and services within the compass of twenty five years may seem difficult if not impossible in the light of present library budgets and resources but it must be borne in mind that the population increase in prospect will also generate at least comparable increases in national income that we can afford to pay for the indicated expansion is suggested by the fact that the increase in the national income of the united states which may be anticipated between  and  even under conservative assumptions will exceed the national income of any nation on the earth today except the united states itself metropolitan area concentration for purposes of the  census and other statistical uses the federal government has delineated  standard metropolitan areas in the united states these consist in general of central cities of  or more inhabitants together with one or more contiguous county populations which according to certain criteria are metropolitan in character and oriented toward the central city in  the standard metropolitan areas in the united states contained less than one third of the population by  the standard metropolitan areas accounted for over half  per cent of the population of the country in the first half of this century while the total population of the united states doubled the population in the metropolitan areas increased three and one half fold the tendency for the population to become increasingly concentrated in metropolitan areas not only is continuing but is also accelerating between  and  metropolitan areas absorbed  per cent of the total population increase of the country in the last decade of this period between  and  metropolitan areas absorbed  per cent of the total population increase of the country between  and  it is estimated by the bureau of the census the metropolitan areas absorbed about  per cent of the total national population increase if the changes experienced between  and  were to continue the standard metropolitan areas would increase by some  million persons between  and  and would contain more than two thirds of the population of the utnited states  based on calculations by the writer assuming no increase in national income per head  for definitions see united states census of population vol ii characteristics of the population p 
community developments and library planning  the library has of course from its inception been essentially an urban institution identified with urbanism as a way of life library facilities continue to be concentrated primarily in urban areas and especially in the larger metropolitan areas in the allocation of resources for libraries in the coming decades it is clear that the problem of expansion is even more than in the past a problem of keeping up with the tremendous increase in metropolitan area inhabitants the extent to which individual metropolitan areas may be expected to increase may be determined through the same analytical procedures utilized in analyzing the trends and making the projections for the country as a whole projections for a number of individual areas are already available decentralization of metropoli tan area population the large city identified with western civilization is in the main the product of the industrial revolution and especially of nineteenth century industrial technology that is the large cities of the united states in common with the large cities in the western world tended in their nineteenth century development to be organized in response to the centripetal forces of the steam engine and the belt and the pulley at the present time metropolitan area populations are apparently responding to centrifugal rather than centripetal forces as is evidenced by increased attention to the problem of decentralizatinn the decentralization of population within our metropolitan areas is in part real and in part only apparent it is real in the sense that the metropolitan physical plant is now responding to twentiethcentury technology the automobile electric power and the telephone which permits wider dispersion of the population than did nineteenth century technology a good example of this is afforded by perhaps the most fully twentiethcentury metropolitan area in the united states namely los angeles on the other hand the fact that larger and larger proportions of the population of our metropolitan areas is resident in the suburban ring rather than the central city results more from natural growth processes than from centrifugal technological forces the rings of our metropolitan areas have been growing more rapidly than our central cities throughout the course of this century largely because our central cities have become filled up cities have arbitrary boundaries set forth in their charters of incorporation in consequence as the economic base and population of the metropolitan area continues to grow the time comes when both industry and population can find locations only outside city limits in the metropolitan ring between  and  the rate of growth of the outlying rings in relation to the rate of growth of central cities was something like  to   compared with  per cent between  and  the ratio of growth of metropolitan rings to growth in the central cities was about  to   compared with  per cent in the first half of this decade from  to  the ratio was  to   compared with  per cent since our metropolitan areas will continue to grow the proportion of metropolitan area population resident in sub eg philip m hauser and gerald s newman projections of population for the chicago standard metropolitan area to  report by the chicago community inventory university of chicago to the chicago plan commission and the office of the housing and redevelopment coordinator chiago august  such projections are often available through city planning commissions
 the library quarterly urban rings will continue to increase if we assume an increase of about  million persons in metropolitan united states between  and  a real possibility continuation of recent changes would place about  million persons in the metropolitan ring and only  million in our central cities moreover of the  million to be added to the metropolitan rings it is possible that about half will be resident in parts of metropolitan areas which are today unincorporated rural fnrnge the implications of these changes should be clear to library planners if library facilities are to be readily accessible to the population in  it is obvious that the library like the retail outlet must continue to follow the new population distribution various ways of dealing with increasingly decentralized populations will undoubtedly continue to develop some effective way of dealing with this situation however must be found by all library administrative personnel charged with planning activities during the years which lie ahead age structure great decreases in the birth rates and death rates of the united states and changes in our immigration policy have greatly affected the age structure of the population undoubtedly the outstanding single change is that referred to as the aging of the population the longrun trend can briefly be summarized by referring to the fact that in  the average american was only sixteen years old by  he was over thirty changes in the average age of the population and the relative size of the various age groupings undoubtedly affect reading habits and therefore merit the attention of the library planners during the first half of this century the median age of the population of the united states rose from  to  years an increase of over seven years while the population of the united states as a whole doubled between  and  persons roughly of elementaryschool age five to fourteen years increased by only  per cent in consequence persons of elementary school age decreased from  per cent of the total population in  to  per cent of the total by  persons of high school age fifteen to nineteen years increased by about  per cent between  and  to decline from  per cent of the population in  to about  per cent of the population in  while younger persons were decreasing as the proportion of the total persons sixty five years of age and over increased from  per cent in  to over  per cent of the population in  while the population doubled the number of senior citizens those sixty five and over quadrupled the postwar boom in marriages and babies in conjunction with previous age trends will produce further significant changes in age structure in the coming decades persons of elementary school age five to fourteen years are likely to increase by from  to  million between  and  or from  to  per cent depending on the course of the birth rate persons of high school age fifteen to nineteen years are likely to increase from  to  million or by from  to  per cent in the same period while the number and proportions of young persons are undergoing this rapid growth the number and proportion of senior citizens will also continue to expand rapidly between  and  persons sixty five years of age and over will increase by about  million or by  per cent thus the library planner while con

 the library quarterly ever since second it may be observed that in  the date of the last census before the outbreak of the civil war  per cent of the negroes were resident in the south a half century later in  the census before the outbreak of world war i showed that this concentration of negroes had declined by only  percentage points to  per cent the first large migratory flows of negroes from the south to the north began during world war i negro migration in response to the need for manpower to man our world war i industrial plant was a replacement for european immigration which came to almost a complete halt during the war third after the passage of our immigration exclusion acts negro migration continued as a substitute for european immigration to meet the needs for manpower of an expanding industrial base negro migration was greatly accelerated during world war ii and will continue to be a major source of manpower for our expanding economy finally the changed character of the negro as a library consumer is highlighted by the fact that the negro is rapidly becoming urbanized through internal migration in  only  per cent of the negroes lived in cities by  over  per cent of the negroes in the north and in the west were urban residents moreover  per cent of the negroes in the south also lived in cities thus the negro has been called upon in a little more than a single generation to make the transition from a rural to an urban way of life the library is undoubtedly contributing toward this transition and will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in this respect in the decades which lie ahead by  it is possible that the north and the west will have as many negroes as the south and that from a third to a half of the population of many of our great cities and a fifth to a third of the population of a number of our standard metropolitan areas wil be negro the family the family in the united states has undergone and is still undergoing significant changes in size and composition and in the nature of family living and interpersonal relations some of these changes undoubtedly affect reading habits in respect to both available time and subject matter moreover the changing character of the family and the new type of problems which these changes pose for its members have become subjects for much written material processed and circulated by libraries for the benefit of family consumers since the growth in the number of households and parents is not identical with the growth of total population data relating to household and family growth point to the special consumer requirements to the extent that they can be differentiated of parents children and other related persons and non related persons living in household groups the size of the family in the united states as measured by the number of persons per household decreased from  in  to  in  even the postwar baby boom did not arrest the longtime downward trend of persons per household between  and  persons per household decreased from  to  and although there has been a slight upturn during this decade the probabilities are high that the average size of household in  will be below that in  the decline in the size of family reflects of course both the decline in fertility and the transition from the large family to the small family sys
community developments and library planning  tem the latter trend has continued even during periods of increases in fertility so as to maintain the downward trend in average size of family the decrease in average size of family produces of course a larger proportion of household heads among the total population and accounts for the greater rate of growth of households or families than of total population between  and  while the total population of the united states increased by about  per cent per year or doubled the number of households increased by about  per cent per year or tripled the formation of new households is affected both by the changing age structure of the population and by the marriage rate marriages per  persons that is the crude marriage rate reached an all time high in  at a level of  through the combined influence of unprecedented levels of economic activity demobilization and a relatively favorable age structure that is a relatively large proportion of persons attaining marriageable age reflecting the birth rate of the mid twenties the postwar marriage boom has created new records in the proportion of the american population married in  only  per cent of males fourteen and over were married by  this proportion had increased to  per cent for females fourteen years of age and over the proportion married over the same time span increased from  to  per cent because of the unavailability of data long time trends cannot be established on the changing household status of the population between  and  for example the proportion of men in the population who were heads of households increased from about  per cent to  per cent the proportion of male children in the population living in households decreased from  per cent to  per cent the proportion of male lodgers from  per cent to less than  per cent among females the proportion of wives increased from  per cent in  to  per cent in  such shifts in household status certainly over the long run must point to changes in reading habits and the demand for various types of library services other types of family changes of undoubted import to library planners are beginning to become available among the most important of which are those related to changes in the family cycle between  and  for example average age at first marriage decreased from  years to  years for the groom and from  years to  years for the bride this decrease in average age at marriage was accompanied also by a decline in age of parents at the birth of the first child the average wife who was about  years old at the birth of the first child in  was about  years old by  of perhaps greater significance for effect on reading habits is the decrease in average age of parents at the birth of the last child in  both parents were well under thirty at the birth of their last child the wife with an average of  years and the husband with an average of  years in  the average wife was about  years old and the average husband  years old at the birth of their last child the changing character of interpersonal relations in the family indicating changes in time available for various types of pursuits including reading is indicated by the earlier departure of children from  paul c glick the life cycle of the family marriage and family living xvii no  february    the family cycle american sociological review xii no  april    american families new york john wiley  sons

 the library quarterly lations of inner zones are therefore being uprooted and dispersed to various sections of the metropolitan area inner zones are being rebuilt or rehabilitated so as to attract not only lower income groupings of the population but also higher income and social groups these developments together with new developments in the suburban rings of the metropolitan areas presage basic changes in the physical structure of our metropolitan areas and of the manner in which they are used these changes have important implications for all agencies providing goods or services to the population including the library the prospect it seems reasonable to expect that the trends in process will produce a much more heterogeneously composed metropolitan area in the decades which lie ahead the spatial patterning of the physical residential plant of our metropolitan areas with its correlative socioeconomic stratification of the population is likely to be drastically modified it is the outlying peripheral areas which are now experiencing the relatively rapid growth experienced by the central cities and inner zones during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries it is possible that while our decayed and obsolescent inner areas are replaced or renovated decay and obsolescence will occur in our suburban rings moreover with increased interventionism and with the increased utilization of the tools of urban renewal it is likely that the physical and socioeconomic character of a community in the future will depend less on the historical accident of its origin and its location in respect to the center and older section of the city and more on the will of organized population groupings as manifest in their planning and development activities thus there will be both good and bad communities at both the center of the metropolitan areas and at their peripheries finally it is possible that an emergent pattern of residence within the metropolitan area may become the modal one in the decades to come there is increasing evidence that the family is tending toward a cyclical use of the metropolitan area in correspondence with the family cycle the newly married couples tend to live toward the center of the city near their places of work as children come they tend to move to the outlying suburban area to place their youngsters in the surrounding of green lawns and open spaces as the last youngster departs for college or gets married to start his own family career the parents show an increasing tendency to move back toward a rebuilt or renovated inner zone of the city on the one hand to escape the chore of mowing the lawn and on the other to be closer to work friends recreation and the many other services and amenities of urban existence the changes under way and those which may be anticipated may call for important adjustments in the present distribution of libraries and their branches and the makeup of the services which they provide specific analyses are desirable for the wide variety of situations both within and between metropolitan areas but in general it may be stated that the library and its branches will be faced with the need to adjust to the changing physical structure of the metropolitan area and changes in the way in which the metropolitan area is used by its inhabitants as well as to changes in population composition and population type
community developments and library planning  summary and conclusions the materials presented above by no means exhaust the changes in population and physical structure in the commumties of the united states which wll affect library planning one obvious development that it is scarcely necessary to mention in this paper is the trend toward increasing enrolment in secondary and higher education which must inevitably affect reading habits this is a trend which it may be assumed is familiar to the library planner among the population changes which cannot be ignored are the increased tempo of population growth occasioned by the war and postwar marriage and baby boom and the profound changes in the age structure which may be anticipated reflecting previous developments in fertility mortality and immigration in general library services must be expanded to meet a population increase of from  to  per cent to accommodate an additional   million persons between  and  moreover to the extent that age differences point to significant differences in reading habits even greater accommodations must be made for individual age groups the library planner must allow for an increase between  and  of from  to  per cent in the population of elementary school age and of from  to  per cent in the population of high school age simultaneously the planner must take into account an increase of  per cent in persons sixtyfive years of age and over who are increasingly leaving the labor force and being confronted with the need to find new ways of filling the life space in their declining years finally while dealing with these great changes for the younger and older groups the library planner must also reckon with a  per cent increase in the population of intermediate agethat is between twenty and sixty four years of more subtle import perhaps are the changes which may be anticipated in ethnicity and race library services for the foreign born and the foreign stock will decrease in importance as the foreign born shrink to the negligible proportion of  or  per cent of the population by  as a special consumer group however the negro who has become the major newcomer to metropolitan united states may replace the foreign born as a consumer of library services in many of our metropolitan areas the negro who is now in transition from a rural to an urban way of life may make up from a fifth to a half of the population the library may become a highly significant agency among the various institutions which will assist the negro in making this basic transition in his way of life also more subtle in its implications for the library planner are the changes which may be anticipated in family size composition and interpersonal relations the astute library planner may do well to pursue the implications of the more rapid rates of growth of families than of population of the increasing number of husband wife years of life together occasioned by decreasing mortality of the increasing number of years of life free from childbearing by the american woman who is marrying earlier and having the last of her children earlier and by the increasing number of husband wife years together after the children have left the family these changes could conceivably afford libraries new opportunities for highly significant services national growth it has been indicated
 the library quarterly will be disproportionately concentrated in our great metropolitan areas and in the suburban rings of those areas including what is now unincorporated rural territory libraries will be faced with the necessity of providing services to perhaps  million additional americans who will be located in the suburban rings of metropolitan areas half of whom may find residences in what is now unincorporated open country finally the library planner must face the fundamental changes in the physical structure and in the use of the physical plant of the metropolitan area while confronted with the necessity for tremendous expansion of services within a relatively short period of time he must also be prepared to make drastic accommodations to greatly changing neighborhoods within the metropolitan complex the tasks which lie ahead for the library planner and it may be added for anyone associated with the development or administration of library servicesare not easy ones the additional financial and other burdens which they will impose upon the community will not be minor ones but the size of the task and the size of the burden must be viewed against the perspective of the fundamental importance of literacy and its role in the american way of life and of the tremendous productivity and purchasing power of the american people which indicate that we can afford to assume the burdens and to complete the requisite tasks
