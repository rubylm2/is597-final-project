constraints on the development of public library service in nigeria anthony olden despite much development since its introduction into nigeria in  public library service is used today by less than  percent of the population this article based on a review of the literature and on eight years of library experience in nigeria attempts to explain why the main constraints have been the irrelevance of the service offered to the illiterate who compose up to two thirds of the adult population and the fact that those who are literate and have access to libraries rarely use them for other than educational purposes and stop using them when their educational goals are achieved or given up other constraints include the redivision of nigeria into smaller internal units lack of professional leadership government legislation backing and financial support in certain states staffing problems and the difficulty of extending service outside the urban areas introduction there are no libraries here except the lagos public library which i have just opened  replied the british council kate d ferguson to an inquiry from the american library association in  today each   would like to thank ronald benge lalage bown dennis gunton spencer s marsh and linda c smith for their comments on the first draft of this article and my former students and colleagues at ahmadu bello university for clarifying many of the issues for me  university of illinois library  west gregory drive urbana illinois   ferguson means libraries in the modern sense of organized collections and services administered by qualified librarians nigeria had private libraries built up by such individuals as henry carr and herbert macauley a subscription library in lagos and agricultural veterinary medical and legal collections serving research station and government department staff there were also private collections of arabic manuscripts in the islamic north  library quarterly vol  no  pp   k  by the university of chicago all rights reserved      
library service in nigeria  of the nineteen states that make up nigeria has a state or public library though the level of service and the percentage of the population served vary tremendously the public library development that has occurred in parts of the country is due mainly to professional leadership and hard work to the backing of certain people in the government and particularly during the late s through the s to encouragement and financial aid from abroad yet the service has had little impact on illiteracy and on the rural areas and is used by less than  percent of the nigerian population currently estimated at over  million those who do use the service are the examination hungry school boys and girls for whom the libraries are mostly glorified classrooms and reading shelters  p  the would be future members of nigeria professional and administrative elite or more accurately the would be future members fortunate enough to live near a service point the history of nigerian public libraries divides into preand post periods  being the year in which the federal government in a vain attempt to halt the slide to civil war abolished the four regions and the federal territory of lagos and substituted a twelve state structure the early period can be reconstructed from the pages of west african libraries wala news and nigerian libraries from annual reports from articles written for overseas journals by nigeria based librarians and by visitors to the country and from subsequently written theses and dissertations the post  period is much more difficult to piece together because progress report type notes and articles appear less often and little or no printed information has been produced about some of the states library services usually although not always because the services themselves hardly existed yet the same problems continue to be mentioned in the literature the main problem is the difficulty of providing a service purporting to be for all but accessible only to some and in fact made use of by only a few in a country where the culture is oral not written most of the adults are not literate and literate and illiterate  public libraries controlled and funded by state governments are also known as state libraries before the creation of states in  they were known as regional libraries  nigeria national population bureau estimates  million for july   the world bank  million for mid   p  according to unesco nigerian public libraries had  registered borrowers in   p vii  the number of users is certainly higher because many go to public libraries to read rather than to borrow in addition universal primary education introduced in  must have boosted public library statistics since  even so it is probably safe to assume that public libraries are still used by less than  percent of the population  for a bibliography on nigerian public libraries see  pp    according to e a daniel cross river has an excellent service its main inadequacy being lack of publicity in and outside the state  p 
 the library quarterly alike want public spending priority given to improving the water supply and health care the schooling their children receive the access roads to their towns and villages and the provision of electricity this article is based on my review of the literature and eight years of library experience in nigeria occasional reference is made to other english speaking african countries much more public library development has taken place in britain former colonies than in those of france belgium or portugal in the words of one nigerian librarian ilt is perhaps the british government which has more than any other outside government aided the development of public library services in africa  p  yet the british model developed in another continent and culture over a period of one hundred years and more has not been transplanted with total success discussion on how to make it relevant to more people is even more important now with nigeria in an economic recession and the government reducing expenditure than it was back in the pioneering preindependence decade of the s when so much seemed within grasp illiteracy at a recent conference in ibadan when a speaker asked what should be done about all those illiterate people i heard a senior librarian muttering to himselfhoot them he was only joking of course but     p  the main constraint on the development of public libraries in nigeria has been their irrelevancy to the illiterate who form the majority of the adult population the fourth natinal development plan   admits that in spite of commendable government intentions  concrete action continued to lag behind words and our high illiteracy ratio has more or less persisted the high pre occupation with the expansion needs of the formal school system during the third plan period undoubtedly diverted attention from the requirements of adult and nonformal education   p  this has been true of the entire period since independence in  formal education has expanded greatly informal has declined the northern region launched its yaki dajahilci campaign against ignorance in  within ten years this governmental enthusiasm had declined there was in the words of mark bray total lack of reference to adult education in the   northern development plan    the second national plan   merely included it with scholarshipsloans and miscellaneous items under the heading of thers all of which in the kano state section were allocated only  per cent of the total education vote  p  there is now a ten year   national literacy campaign but its progress is affected by nigeria current economic difficulties
library service in nigeria  for adult illiterates and new literates public libraries have done little although their potential to help was recognized early on the introduction to the proceedings of unesco  seminar on the development of libraries in africa pointed out that people are being helped by mass education programmes to emerge from illiteracy and ignorance and they need continued access to suitable publications stimulation of their reading interests and expert reading guidance to sharpen their new skill into an effective instrument of self education only a few new literates are now served by public libraries and if the others do not in the near future have access to such services most will probably stagnate or slide back into illiteracy thereby wasting the efforts expended by themselves and their teachers  p  dennis gunton one time head of the northern regional library service says that what fascinated him when later on he had time to look back and study the s and s was the way that early enthusiasm for libraries as a means of eradicating illiteracy    gradually dissipated libraries got under way but never tackled illiteracy there simply was no correlation between stated aims and policies pursued as someone on the spot at the time it was not my impression that this was done knowingly rather that the sheer enormity of the task was intuitively recognised and left to universal primary education to tackle the qualifications experience and training of the small body of professionals did not equip them for the work  the librarians already overworked in their efforts to initiate and provide service for the category of users that clamored for it must also have been affected by the government preference for formal rather than informal education programs according to bray who contrasted the universal free primary education upe schemes launched in the s by capitalist nigeria and socialist tanzania in nigeria upe was only part of a massive overall formal educational expansion and a high proportion of primary leavers could proceed to post primary education but in tanzania upe was launched in conjunction with a large scale ongoing adult basic education project at the expense of post primary training there was much greater emphasis in tanzania on primary education being a self contained unit and on orienting school leavers towards the rural societies from which the majority came  pp   the nigerian upe scheme launched in september  aimed at enrolling each year free of charge all children aged six so that within a few years most children of primary school age would be enrolled upe has been a success in terms of increased enrollment although the quality of instruction has not always been high its momentum was affected by the reintroduction of school fees by some state governments who maintained that their funds were inadequate to keep the scheme going free of charge even so its impact has been immense its child beneficiaries will
 the library quarterly gradually increase the proportion of literates in the adult population and thus the pool of potential library users according to unesco  percent of nigeria population aged fifteen and over is illiterate  p i  literacy figures are not necessarily reliable and one adult education authority lalage bown believes that the number of illiterates has always been less than official figures show only those literate in the roman script are counted which excludes some in the muslim north who read and write ajami hausa in arabic script the real problem states bown is the uneven distribution of literacy in the adult population probably  in urban areas of bendel and less than  in remote rural areas of some northern states  not all illiterates are poor some are successful business people and traders whose natural abilities and drive have overcome the disadvantage of little or no schooling more women are illiterate than men female education lags behind because marriage is nearly universal in africa and families know that when a girl marries her first responsibility will be to her husband and his people nigerians invest in people their savings go toward the education of younger members of their extended families who with luck will one day acquire the certificates that secure the well paid jobs and when with luck again they will remember their earlier benefactors this is a form of insurance in a country not wealthy enough to be able to afford government organized social welfare for all boys are safer investments than girls hence the disparity between male and female public library use and achievement levels in literacy and formal education an assessment of the enugu central library in  showed a heavy preponderance of male members on the library register in the proportion of eleven males to one female but children membership is more even seven to four and this gives promise of more balanced membership in the future  p  enugu is in the eastern part of nigeria to which european missionaries introduced christianity and elementary  this is still in the s no more than a promise what the author unnamed but presumably s h horrocks an english librarian who worked with the eastern region library board under unesco auspices may not have realized is that the higher the level the more difficult it is for girls to stay in the race the records of the ahmadu bello university library school illustrate this though allowance must be made for the particularly disadvantaged position of women in the north where the university is situated of the  nongraduate diplomas awarded from  the year the first awards were made up to and including  eighty four or  percent went to females of the  bls degrees awarded from  the year the first awards were made to  forty four or  percent went to females of the twenty one mls degrees awarded from  the year the first award was made to  only two or  percent went to females  pp  
library service in nigeria  western type schooling in the nineteenth century the majority of the population is christian in the north the majority is muslim a religion which at least as interpreted by many of its northern nigerian male adherents keeps women more firmly in the background the exceptionally sluggish pace of the growth of female education in the muslim north has been attributed to a number of factors the most significant of which are i the peculiar islamic marriage customs that permit girls to be married off between the ages of eleven and twelve and then allow them to be confined under the purdah system of kulle in a state of almost total isolation not only from the mainstream of formal school education but also from any significant participation in the social and economic life of their community and ii the lukewarm support for the education of women by the political decision makers reflected in their own personal examples   and in the paucity of post primary institutions for women  p  in  the first person to be enrolled as a user of the mobile library that unesco supplied to enugu was flora azikiwe  p  wife of nnamdi azikiwe the then premier of eastern nigeria and a christian during the second republic   the vice president alex ekwueme also a christian from the east was often accompanied on public occasions by his wife but the president shehu shagri a muslim from sokoto in the far north always appeared alone the purposes for which public libraries are used recently it has been pointed out that the long standing belief that africans do not read does not hold up any more  p  it is true however that reading in nigeria is still mainly utilitarian a way of acquiring the information necessary to pass the examinations that permit one to continue to the next stage of schooling or to take employment at a more highly paid level the main purpose of the public library is educational the unesco public library manifesto proclaimed in  public libraries in nigeria are educational they are used chiefly as quiet places to study and as sources of books that are otherwise unavailable or are beyond the means of those who wish to read them the people of enugu read mainly for elf improvement and to ain knowledge rather than to amuse themselves  p  according to a report from the early s most recently a survey showed that school age youths of between  and  years constitute the bulk of library users most of them use the library for their school work  p  young nigerians use the library to study because their homes are too sociable and crowded to permit concentration r c benge recalling how in trinidad many young people  used to study for their examinations
 the library quarterly at night by reading at the foot of the public lamp post stated that in africa there was an obvious professional library duty to provide very large reading rooms simply for study purposes  p  in the opinion of the commissioner for economic development and reconstruction in the post civil war east central state government the sedentary reading room is more valuable than the mobile library  p  in  north central state was making plans to attach a reading room to each new library because of our realisation of the fact that throughout the country the demand for reading spaces pure and simple is great  p  but not all librarians have been sympathetic to reading space and those who make use of it african public libraries tend to be filled with what are unfairly called ropouts from the formal education process they use the library to study their textbooks yet their presence is often deplored and discouraged since it is alleged that they are not really using the library for reference purposes but only as a reading room if national development is to mean anything benge concluded these are the young people who should be catered to  p  nor have all librarians shown enthusiasm for supplying the material their users would like in  joan parkes later joan allen northern nigeria regional librarian said that she was not prepared to buy textbooks for her library but that she would buy and sell to readers at cost textbooks which she considered did not warrant the expenditure of public money  p  the unesco consultant to eastern nigeria cautioned that there was a very great need indeed for the readinj of imaginative works among educated nigerians alice in wonderland or jane austen are more important than simon local government at this juncture i am therefore more than pleased with the decision that  no special attention will be paid to the provision of textbooks nor will such borrowing be encouraged  p  benge showed more understanding in  when most of britain former colonies had gained their independence he wrote at the present time many african countries are involved in a revolutionary situation which strains human resources to the utmost great emphasis has to be placed on acquiring technical knowledge and new skills it will be readily apparent that textbooks and practical manuals must be the main essential reading matter  p   it is an example turned ironic by this recent comment from a nigerian librarian the temptation is irresistible to suggest that wherever nigerians and indeed other predominantly oral aural cultures function in situations requiring some record keeping or the manipulation of graphic records there are chaos inefficiency and confusion it is like finding oneself in that strange part of alice looking glass country where it takes all one strength to remain on the same spot  p 
library service in nigeria  in addition to space and material for study purposes what should public libraries provide the obvious answer would seem to be multiple copies of the books magazines and newspapers that nigerians buy and borrow from each other to read for pleasure and for information on politics and current affairs hans m zell suggests that for school leavers that is high school graduates at least book reading has become a habit even if book buying has not  p  there are a great many african publications to buy nowadays publishing in nigeria and overseas publishing for and about nigeria has expanded tremendously since the s when the books supplied by the northern regional headquarters were sardonically described by j a faseyi as quite suitable for a public library in the suburbs of london  p  this was no doubt true but it was not the fault of the librarians a comparison of the size and contents of the volumes of the nigerian and british national bibliographies for the s puts the matter in perspective but the days when literature was just another marvel that came with all the other wondrous things of civilisation like motor cars and aeroplanes from far away  p  are gone the heinemann african writers series now has  titles macmillan pacesetters novels written by nigerian authors for young adults are a commercial success fourth dimension and other companies have published best selling memoirs of the civil war the northern nigerian publishing company continues to produce material in hausa for which there is much demand apart from yoruba and igbo other nigerian languages are less well served the numbers of people literate in them are too small to interest commercial publishers little exists in print other than bibles and religious pamphlets children are less affected than others by the constraints on public library service the significance of encouraging them to make use of libraries with the probability that some at least will continue this use as adults is obvious when one realizes that over half of nigeria more than  million people are estimated to be under fifteen years of age  bown points out that naiwu osahon author and publisher of sex is a nigger claims to have sold a quarter of a million copies in nigeria soft porn is not what one goes to libraries for but if nigerians read that at least they can be accused of not reading for entertainment  this brings to mind a kenyan publisher conclusion better to read local trash than imported trash  p  nigeria has enjoyed remarkable freedom of expression under both civilian and military governments but the official stance on morality is strong librarians would run into opposition in their communities and lose some of their clientele if they were unwise enough to stock works that many would term immoral especially if the immorality had a contemporary setting was inexcusable on literary grounds and did not meet with retribution
 the library quarterly state creation the division and redivision of nigeria the book stock and the staff have now been divided between the six states in an operation so hasty ill conceived and arbitrary as to constitute one of the most curious episodes in library history  p x  public library development in nigeria has been greatly affected by the division and redivision of the country into smaller internal units fig  divisions made not with public libraries in mind but in order to keep the federation peaceful stable and unified the first division occurred in  when part of the western region was carved out and became the midwest this had no effect because the western service hardly extended beyond ibadan the capital and the new region if it inherited anything from the west inherited its lack of action on public libraries the political turmoil toward the end of the first republic   the military coups of  the outbreak of civil war the invasion of the midwest by a force from biafra in  and the recovery of the area by the federal troops precluded action on libraries until the war was nearly over the next redivision was in  when the four regions and the federal territory of lagos were abolished and twelve states established this had an enormous effect on the north where one region was broken up into six states buildings had to stay where they were but books and staff were shared out  asked whether the decision to share the library assets could not be reversed the permanent secretary of the interim administration in kaduna declared there could be no going back and no going through the motions whilst retaining the old power structure the regional library was one of the many regional institutions being broken and scattered there would be waste confusion the misery of dislocation for staff and their families and little hope of any of the nucleus collections functioning in the near future however in the tense period of the civil war every priority was given to removing sources of political l gunton who several years earlier had been northern regional librarian refutes the story that the army divided up multivolume sets of reference works so as to share out the volumes between the states the reference collection remained intact in kaduna virtually the sole exception  p  rank and file soldiers in africa do not have much education and when in control are not necessarily respectful of those who do or concerned with the books and libraries through which they received it this is illustrated by what happened to libraries retaken by federal troops during the civil war  more recently in uganda the headmaster of a school that had been used as a barracks showed a visitor the remaining volumes of an encyclopedia all he had left because the soldiers took the books for cooking  p

 the library quarterly faseyi who stayed in kaduna suggested in  that the staff deployed to the states will perhaps form the germ of the state library services  p  in most instances the germination process never took place some of the new state librarians had been raised far above their level of competence simply because they happened to be the only qualified indigenes from their areas m s onye has complained that newly created states inherited not only staff and stock but also the lack of policy which had existed with the former order public libraries in the six states went to sleep in either the military governors offices or in the ministries of education and information  p  this was not true of north central later kaduna where considerable progress was made under faseyi but not many of the others in charge of the new state libraries were capable of putting together a policy or of convincing those with power to allocate public funds that public library development was worth spending money on three days after may   the day on which yakubu gowon the army officer who was federal head of state announced the abolition of the regions and their replacement by twelve states emeka ojukwu military governor of the region which gowon announcement had just split into three responded by proclaiming the former eastern nigeria independent as the republic of biafra the state creation exercise could not be fully implemented in the east until january  when what remained of biafra finally gave in and surrendered to the federal forces the former region had the best public library service in nigeria prior to  the three new states east central south eastern and rivers worked hard to overcome the ravages and setbacks of the war by  one of them was well on the way to providing once more the best public library service in the country  p  this was east central directed by kalu okorie who in  had become the first nigerian to gain a professional library qualification ironically in the next state creation exercise  when the twelve were replaced by nineteen plus the new federal capital territory abuja east central was split into two imo and anambra okorie became director of libraries in imo state an area roughly one sixth the size of the region into which he had introduced public libraries some twenty years earlier in preindependence nigeria not only did the division and redivision of the federation into smaller internal units bring to the top a number of people with no capacity for leadership but it reduced by a third and then again by a half the area under the direction of one exceptional public librarian the setbacks caused by state creation in nigeria have not been shared by other african countries where the organization of the public library service on a national rather than regional or state basis is the norm the kenya national library service the tanzania library services and the
library service in nigeria  ghana library board all serve or attempt to serve entire countries the decision that public library service in nigeria should be based on smaller units goes back to  when the council of ministers took the view that it must be regional local and private organisations which increase library facilities throughout the territory quoted in  p  given the size of nigeria population one service for the entire nation would appear to be out of the question but the present situation where the quality of service ranges from reasonable for example anambra bendel cross river imo kaduna rivers to nonexistent sokoto and there is no coordination at the federal level is far from satisfactory the national library of nigeria which commenced service in  does take an interest in public library development and since  has organized an annual conference of state librarians it must be unique among national libraries in that legislation requires it to set up a branch in each state several branches have been set up so far in anambra kaduna plateau and rivers the intention being that by assisting with research and reference they should complement the public library service  it could be argued that this must result in a certain amount of duplication and the money expended on setting up these branches would be better spent developing public libraries leadership legislation and finance in any programme for library development two essential factors are necessary there should be in the first place enthusiasm on the part of the government for such a programme and secondly there should be the right leadership at the professional level capable of executing such a programme if the library service in the former eastern nigeria made any impression it was due largely to the presence of these factors if the west had at least one of these factors in the fifties the story  would have been different  p  professional leadership government support and funding and legislative backing are usually intertwined and mutually dependent factors perhaps the most important of these is leadership most public library development has occurred in areas with higher than average literacy and educational levels backing from one or more civilian or military ruler or senior civil servant and above all a dynamic regional or state librarian with the capacity to present a strong case for the library existence in the first place  p  it is true that if money is not available even the strongest leadership can achieve little but under less limiting circumstances much can and has been done the success stories of the former eastern region and of bendel formerly mid western and kaduna formerly north central states are well known the stories of the areas

library service in nigeria  staffing problems staffing is perhaps the most complex of all the constraints on public library development in nigeria in the beginning the problem was simple there were not enough librarians then there were not enough nigerian librarians not enough nigerian librarians of northern origin not enough librarians from for example the borno part of the north now with the expansion of library education each state has at least a handful of indigenes who hold professional library qualifications but even those with many find them unenthusiastic about working for the state public library development throughout the country has been retarded by the fact that librarians employed by universities almost all federally funded enjoy better conditions of service than those employed by state governments public library development in the north has been retarded by the shortage of people from the area who have library training and by the reluctance of some state governments to employ any nigerian not born in the right stateby which they mean their own ethnicity and state consciousness ethnicity or tribalism as it used to be called gives preference to people from one home area people who speak the same language and on whom one ought to be able to depend with some certainty it exists in varying degrees in most parts of the world and its existence in nigeria is perfectly understandable in view of the fact that the country huge population is made up of many different peoples speaking different languages all living together within national borders determined by outsiders in europe less than one hundred years ago the main drawback of ethnicity or state consciousness as it is often referred to in nigeria is that it hinders the development of the nation by causing jobs to be given to people on the basis of where they were born rather than their ability to do the work recruitment practices have for many years reflected undue sensitivity about extending state employment opportunities to personnel of different states of origin with top appointments reserved for the ons of the soil  p  the origins of today unequal supply of trained manpower within the country go back at least as far as the early years of the century by which time the british had achieved full control over all the area that they named nigeria christian missionaries from europe had established  one university lbadan offers the mls as its basic professional program three others ahmadu bello maiduguri bayero offer the undergraduate bls or bals a number of other institutions offer library science at minor or at various certificate and diploma levels
 the library quarterly schools in parts of the south in the latter part of the nineteenth century under an agreement between the governor sir frederick lugard later lord lugard and the traditional rulers of the islamic north missionaries could enter an emirate only with its ruler consent the north had koranic schools and a tradition of islamic scholarship stretching back hundreds of years but in the years following the second world war as pressure in the south brought independence nearer the north realized that it did not have the western trained manpower to take over the positions which the british would vacate on or shortly after independence and that the south did thus the northernisation policy intended as a means of developing the educational ie manpower needs of the region and increasing the professional competence of its human material in order to facilitate its recruitment into top positions in the northern services an unavoidable concomitant of this obviously praiseworthy effort was the systematic exclusion of southern nigerians from the region public service and the expressed preference for non nigerian expatriate officers for appointment on contract basis not surprisingly the policy was seen by nigerians outside the region as a gigantic government programme deliberately embarked upon to breed nepotism favouritism and tribalism  p  the policy did not cease with the splitting of the region into states the imbalance in the supply of trained and experienced public librarians within the country is best illustrated by specific examples when south eastern later cross river state appointed a director of library services toward the end of the civil war it was able to offer the post to a nigerian qualified since  e e oku who had served as city librarian of lagos from  up to the time she decided to return to her home state when in the early s bendel state wanted someone to continue the work begun by priscilla harris it chose winifred onyeonwu who had years of professional experience in canada when imo and rivers advertised for directors of library services in  each specified ten years of postqualification experience knowing that their states had the indigenes who could fulfill this requirement when a h ningi was given charge of kano state library early in  he had less than twelve months postqualification experience having graduated from ahmadu bello university in  fortunately for kano ningi made an excellent state librarian doing much to expand the service but it is a fact that other similar appointments in the north have not been a success and have done little to advance public library development according to adeyemo aderinto the practice of what some people term as partheid in nigeria has thus constituted one of the important hurdles militating against free interstate flow of human resources which is a  he is actually an indigene of the adjoining bauchi state not of kano
library service in nigeria  necessary condition for even development  p  a few of the better state libraries have made an effort to recruit outside their borders onyeonwu when director of bendel state libraries would visit library schools to speak about the importance of public libraries and to encourage students from any part of the federation to apply for posts in bendel reluctance to and difficulty in getting work outside one home state are hindrances to public library more than to university library development up to the late s when some states began to establish their own all universities were federal institutions in each obviously the local people or sons of the soil had the advantage but nonlocals could not be discriminated against too blatantly as a result librarians would consider and be considered for employment in universities outside their home states but not in public libraries poor conditions of service and prospects the disappointing level of public library development in some states is not necessarily due to a lack of qualified indigenes according to the records of ahmadu bello university of the  bls degrees awarded to nigerians between  the year the first degrees were awarded and  seventy one or almost one third went to people of kwara state origin  p  yet despite this abundance of qualified librarians from within its borders kwara does not have one of the better staffed public library services in the country benue also has an abundance of librarians but poorly staffed public libraries one reason for this is that younger librarians prefer to work in universities where they will receive higher salaries and more frequent promotions as university senior staff they are eligible for campus housing at a nominal rent and their children can attend the campus school in which the standard of teaching is likely to be higher than in other elementary schools in the area also they may be able to use their university bases to enhance their own qualifications by registering for higher degrees and to assist family and friends seeking admission to programs of study other drawbacks are what the younger librarians view as the low qualification levels and poor achievement records of some long serving state librarians many of the present state librarians do not have degrees but are associates of the british library association alas they gained this qualification in the s and s and like others elsewhere in the british commonwealth have been adversely affected by the development of librarianship into an entirely graduate profession in britain their qualifications and attainments have come under increasing fire from those younger and more qualified as a result of the poor image created by these ala librarians the number of new graduates willing to take up appointment in public libraries has dwindled  p 
 the library quarterly recuming gaps the filling of a top library post with a suitable appointee does not necessarily mean that the staffing problem thus resolved will not recur  vacancies may be caused by retirements and deaths by transfers and promotions in a public library service staffed by a number of qualified experienced people this may not cause much of an upheaval when winifred onyeonwu was appointed permanent secretary in the bendel ministry of education she was succeeded as state librarian by her deputy d  oboro when early in  a h ningi was made commissioner of works and transport in bauchi he left behind him in kano state library a number of qualified librarians at least one of whom had by then postqualification experience as long as his own but when umaru alk moved to government house as principal assistant secretary and soon after was made secretary of the national population bureau bauchi state bauchi state library was left in the charge of a nongraduate diploma holder many paraprofessionals do excellent work but they are intended for middle not top management in nigerian libraries and are small boys by comparison with senior state officers with whom they are in contact no state would ask a draftsman to act as chief architect no public library service in the charge of a paraprofessional is likely to make progress the difficulty of extending service outside the urban areas the people who inaugurated public library service in the three regions in the s started by setting up headquarters in kaduna ibadan and enugu capitals of the north the west and the east and commencing service to the residents by  when the regions broke up the west had not extended its service beyond ibadan where it occupied temporary premises the north by far the largest region had a fine library building in kaduna built with british aid a light pleasant branch library  p  in bida  miles away in niger province and the nucleus of two provincial libraries  p  in sokoto  miles from kaduna and maiduguri  miles four professionally controlled service points in an area more than three times the size of england scotland and wales the much smaller eastern region had achieved most a new headquarters and lending library in enugu four new  public library staff shortages are a problem not only in nigeria out of the seventeen professional staff recruited in the zambia library service since  none has remained on the job the last three resigned during the year  under review  p
