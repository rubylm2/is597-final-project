manuscripts in microfilm problems of cataloger and bibliographer william jerome wilson subject cataloger and research scholar n k o aomerican librarian it has been said can see a hundred books together and not be seized with an irresistible desire to make a card catalog of them historically however the card catalog seems to be not an american but a french invention the first record of its use is apparently in i when the abbe rozier employed it in indexing the publications of the paris academy of sciences about a century later in the i several american libraries began to print their entry cards this more perhaps than any other one thing made possible the enormous expansion of modern catalogs printing supplied any desired number of duplicates at a very slight cost and thus facilitated the use of the added entry one of the most important devices in the whole of library science normally the main entry for a book occurs under the name of the author which therefore appears on the first line of the printed card but some books have two or more authors and many books treat of several subjects for each of these by means of added entries a copy of the printed card can be inserted at the proper alphabetical point in the catalog at the top of the card above the first line of print one merely typewrites the desired name title or subject which then becomes the controlling element in the alphabetization of that card the beauty of this device is that it puts the complete information in at every point at which the item will presumably be looked up the added entry is to the card catalog what an index is to a printed book it is generally felt that the films assembled by the war emergency program require some kind of card cataloging shall we view this indulgently as a mere library fetish in the good american tradition or is there some logical need for it there is a need but it may not be immediately apparent it would seem at first sight that such check lists as the one recently issued giving merely the designating numbers of the manuscripts should meet all the real needs of scholars for those who already know of the existence and the general nature of the works who have seen descriptions of them in bibliographies or in printed catalogs and who have in fact made request for the films on the basis of such knowledge the check lists are enough in other words the expert who already knows the field who knows the titles of the significant books and the location of the pertinent manuscripts needs merely to be informed that film copies are available and some to conclude the argument will doubtless add that these are recondite and difficult areas of research in which no one but the expert has any business to be at large  cf m s r james the progress of the modem card catalog principle in the library and its contents ed harriet price sawyer classics of american librarianship ed a e bostwick new york h w wilson co  pp i  also richard b prosser the origin of the card catalogue library association record ii igoo ir 
 the library quarterly such an argument goes at once to the fundamentals of the cataloger art and its interrelations with scholarship a card catalog is a sort of perennial guessing game at one end of the tray of cards stands the producer the catalogerearnestly wondering under what heading the scholar will be likely to look various things up at the other end stands the consumer the scholar racking his brain to imagine how the cataloger may have classified what he wants often luckily their guesses coincide also by frequent contact they tend to educate each other and to become used to each other terminology and ways of thinking as a matter of fact research scholarship and subject cataloging are largely complementary professions the generalizations of the historian or other interpretive scholar provide library science with its most important subject headings and the cataloger if he hopes to keep up must read constantly and extensively in the literature of the field in which he specializes the scholar on the other hand depends on the library and more specifically on its catalog to guide him to the material which he needs but there is a qualification to be made here it is not for his own specialty for the field in which he is already an expert that the scholar commonly consults the subject entries of a library catalog in his own field he depends on classified bibliographies and on periodical literature to keep himself up to date in fact by these means he is usually able to stay a few jumps ahead of the catalog and so criticize its shortcomings this endears him to catalogers but any interpretive scholar if he has proper curiosity and originality constantly finds his investigations leading off into fields in which he is not an expert here he is pretty much at the mercy of his library subject catalogers from their cards if they have prepared them well he can with a little acumen see what the leading works in this new field are and what he had better read first these are just the beginning in scholarship as in sin one thing leads to another and presently he has read or skimmed enough works in the new field to graduate from the subject catalog from this point onward he demands of his library chiefly author and title service he knows what books in this special field he would like to see and consults the catalog only to find if they are available that is why the union catalog at the library of congress which gives main entries only is still one of the greatest instruments of research ever put together it is almost the ultimate recourse of scholars who know their subjects and wish only to learn if and where certain works may be had microfilm entrees for the union catalog the check lists that are being issued for the films in the emergency program have no subject entries at all and even for author and title service they cannot be permanently satisfactory for a time and particularly for the scholars who requested the items in the first place they will serve but long before they have attained ten thousand entries it will become irksome to go through one list after another in the search for a particular book or manuscript and even if the lists are periodically cumulated they will show only whether a work is in this particular collection if one desires to know also whether it is in the reproductions of the modern language association in project a or in some other collection of the library it will be necessary to look elsewhere and the natural

 the library quarterly books regarding the signatures or quires into which the pages are grouped but the collation is a time consuming thing to make and in many cases it cannot properly be determined on the basis of the film alone hence at least one university has directed its catalogers of microfilm to omit the point and they are reported as much relieved by the omission since the collation is properly an attribute of the original book it is perfectly logical to omit it in cataloging a film copy after all it is the film not the book that is the actual subject of the entry and the film as such has no collation or ought we perhaps to consider the collation of a film as consisting of a statement of its width the number of frames ie of separate photographic exposures and the position these would indicate its physical makeup to anyone used to such terminology position is a technical term for the relation of the direction of the writing on the one page or two page exposure to the lengthwise direction of the film there is as yet no international agreement as to the numbering or other designation to be used for the four possible positions but in this country it is customary to speak of placements i ii ii s and iii placements ii and iii have two pages to each frame while i and ii s have only one by and large the films of printed books should not present serious difficulty to skilled catalogers used to handling early imprints the subject classification is already in existence and many of the authors who will be encountered have as the term goes been established both as to date and as to the form often variable of the name the chief drawback to such cataloging will be the time it requires and time means money the excessive costs of cataloging are already under fire and the sudden introduction of perhaps ten thousand films of rare books and manuscripts into the library of congress will do nothing to lower the average expense per item two general observations at this point are perhaps pertinent one is that in  cf margaret f parmelee cataloging microfilms at the university of michigan library journal of doctmentary reproduction iii i   with a facsimile of one of the catalog cards they do not usually note imperfections missing title pages cite authority for supplied titles indicate the length of the film in frames as is sometimes done in descriptions of films mention illustrations or give either the size of the original or the width of the film for the most part the films are kept in the form of hundred foot rolls arrangement of the titles in the series according to classification would require cutting up the films so that there would be a single title on a strip of film the films would be easier to use in this form but the division would make a great deal of extra work and require much more storage space although the films are not arranged by class a number in the library of congress classification is assigned to each title and a card for it is placed in our shelf list which is sometimes used as a classed catalog the call number is not placed on the rest of the set of cards instead the word ilm appears in the upper left hand corner toward the end of this valuable record of experience the author observes aside from the fact that we do not give collation the films are as difficult to catalog as the original old books would be and since we have had no additional help in oing the work it has been impossible to keep up to date in cataloging the collection  for an illustration see jouirnal of documnentary reproduction iv ii  fig r an earlier discussion was given by robert c binkley in his manual on methods of reproducing research materials ann arbor mich edwards bros inc i p i the designation ii s is sometimes written out as ii single h h fussler photographic reproduction for libraries chicago university of chicago press  p  and p ii uses for placement the simple numbers i    cf a d osborn the crisis in cataloging library qiuarterly xi i  ii mr william a jackson of the harvard library in a letter of august  i summarizes thiis matter as it applies to microfilms in one well chosen sentence it is very hard for administrators of foundations to realize that the cost of making the microfilms is really the smallest part of the cost if they are to be properly handled once they are made
manuscripts in microfilm  some sense or other the value of money has changed since let us say the turn of the century whether this change is genuinely inflationary or represents simply an increase in average cash iiicome and scale of living is hard to say in either case it is probably necessary in comparing costs now and a quarter of a century ago to make allowance for a virtual doubling of cash charges this affects profoundly the comparative studies of the cost of cataloging the other observation looks in somewhat the same direction a large catalog is like a telephone system the more it expands the higher is the unit cost the telephone companies a few years ago carried on campaigns of public education to drive home the point that their business is not like others that as their business expands costs do not drop but rise and that the subscriber while forced to pay m lore receives a progressively larger more comprehensive and better integrated service the similarity between this and a catalog is obvious as the catalog grows the burden of adjustment increases there are more things to look up more possible points of contact but also a greatly increased usefulness for example in a library of a thousand books there may be only one author to file under the name smith and there is no need to determine whether a title page mentioning j smith really means john smith jared smith jehosaphat smith or some other in a large library on the other hand there may be entries for a hundred john smiths or a thousand smiths cultural institutions have in recent years become quite wary of accepting collections of material unless the gifts carry endowment for upkeep the possession of the material imnplies an obligation to care for it organize it and make it available for use and within an already preoccupied budget this may be impossible some such difficulty would confront the library of congress in accepting the films of the emergency program if the rockefeller foundation had not recently sanctioned the use of part of the fund for the purpose of cataloging the material this still leaves the question open however as to what form of catalog is desirable and as to what degree of refinement in the cataloging is feasible mannuscript cataloging in america american libraries have done much in the calendaring or other listing of archival manuscripts epistolary materials personal papers and the like but have had relatively little occasion to deal with book manuscripts the former are a native product but the latter almost wholly an importation the dominant civilization of the new world developed after the invention of printing the book trade went over rather promptly to the form of print whereas archival and epistolary materials lolng continued to be written chiefly by hand as early as the colonial period a few book manuscripts were brought from europe to america and about the beginining of the present century considerable collections began to be built up but not before i was a systematic listing of the items published even then they were not cataloged in any proper sense of the term the publication was deliberately called a census in recognition of its provisional character it  seymour de ricci ed with the assistance of w j wilson census of afedieval and renaissanlce manuscripts ini thc united states and canada  vols new york h w wilson co   for a lbrief survey of the early infiltration of european book manuscripts into america anid a list of some of the special catalogs of american owned
 the library quarterly was hoped that it would lead and in several instances it did lead to a more complete cataloging of the manuscripts by the institutions owning them the results however were usually put out in book form not on cards since each manuscript was unique the possession of a single library there was little incentive to make a co operative enterprise of the cataloging and to spread the results abroad by means of printed cards but now with microfilm negatives of some six hundred book manuscripts already received from britain and hundreds of others on the way all of them expressly intended to be copied and sold to any purchaser the usefulness of printed cards is much enhanced and the cataloging might become in some sense a co operative undertaking if well constructed by careful catalogers at the library of congress or some other center of manuscript studies the cards should be of value wherever a copy of any of the films is sent in fact many libraries would be likely to subscnrbe for complete sets of the cards simply as a bibliographical tool these at a cost of a few cents each would be much cheaper than a full duplicate run of the films and would also be more valuable to research scholars unless the local library set to work and cataloged the films itself it would always be known that the films even if not available at the local library on five or six minutes notice could be secured from the library of congress within five or six days a system of interlibrary loans of positive copies might even be instituted or possibly an arrangement to rent them at a stated fraction of the cost of printing the positive although its catalog division has never dealt directly with manuscripts the library of congress is not wholly without experience in the field between  and i chiefly through its card division and its manuscript division it prepared cards for some  of the rotographs of the modern language association of america the items were fully cataloged according to library of congress procedure except that no classification number was assigned the collation of the original manuscripts is usually given but is warily stated to be based on the facsimile subject entries are added some of the commoner ones being manuscripts latin facsimiles and manuscripts gt britfacsimiles whether these could profitably be continued for a series of filmed facsimiles that threatens to run into the thousands is problematical no cards were prepared for modern language association items on film soon after the films began to arrive in large quantities the library of congress undertook to renegotiate its contract with the association but the new agreement has not yet been announced another pioneer in this general field is the university of chicago in i it published a descriptive catalog of its manuscripts the first american institution to perform such a service it has become an important center for such studies particularly in the new testament field and is now issuing printed manuscripts subsequent to the census see w j wilson medieval and renaissance manuscripts in america catholic bookman iv i    if the present plan for multilith publication of the entire card catalog of the library of congress is continued the cards for films of manuscripts provided they are ultimately admitted to that catalog would of course appear in successive supplements to the publication  edgar j goodspeed ed with the assistance of martin sprengling a descriptive catalogue of manuscripts in the libraries of the university of chicago chicago university of chicago press  pp xi

 the library quarterly provision for assembling this information on cards as a result the vatican index becomes in this respect as atomistic as the ayscough printed catalog what was done on the modern language association cards in such cases is interesting if the manuscript in question contains a single work the main entry for the facsimile is under author if known and title if the manuscript is composite in structure or miscellaneous in contents the facsimile is entered under the name of the owning library and that library designating number the separate authors and treatises are then indicated by added entries this practice seems admirable and i would offer only one suggestion namely that for films of all manuscripts the simple as well as the composite or miscellaneousit might be well to make the main entry under the owning library and local number for this suggestion i can present no precedent and can foresee some objection i would point out however that it involves no extra work if the main entry is by library and local number then the author or title is given by added entry if the main entry is by author or title then the owning library with its local number is given by added entry in this respect the two methods are in even balance now no one certainly would suggest that a library should arrange a card catalog of its own manuscripts in the order of the local designating numbers this would make of the catalog a virtual shelf list but when a facsimile on film or paper is made and taken away from the owning library the situation is changed the local designation then becomes a sort of personal name for the manuscript by that designation it is known in printed catalogs in scholarly treatises in collections of source materials it would simplify the control of the various cataloging and listing processes if this designation were everywhere made basic in the arrangement of the published check lists in the possible union catalog entries and in the main entries for the public catalog of the library of congress the problem of the isolated catalog with one important exception to be mentioned hereafter there is apparently no useful halfway stage between the simple check list type of entry and the full form suitable for the regular catalog of the library of congress many of these manuscripts that are coming in on film have been well cataloged and the printed catalogs are supplied with excellent indexes it is no real service to transform these printed descriptions into catalog cards and not supply them with at least enough added entnres to take the place of the indexes nor is it any great service to draw up cards with all the necessary additions and leave them in an isolated catalog by themselves only when inserted in a fully integrated catalog like that of the library of congress can they attain their maximum usefulness an almost tragic example of this is the fate of the cards so carefully drawn up for the earlier rotographs of the modern language association these have probably been of use to certain outside libraries and an alphabetical file of them with the added entries duly inserted is kept in the division of manuscripts but apparently few if any of the  or more cards have ever been filed in the public catalog of the library of congress they are constructed according to the regular cataloging rules with added entries and all the rest right up to the last stage in the process but there the process breaks off as we have
manuscripts in microfilm  seen there is no established classification and numbering for manuscripts in the library of congress system therefore these cards have never received numbers accordingly having no call numbers they are not filed in the public catalog though in every other respect they are ready for it a concrete illustration of the situation as it stands is the following the library possesses a book containing an edition of a part of british museum additional manuscript  the main entry for this work is under the author name and by means of an added entry another copy of the card in introduced under british museum mss additional  the modern language association has a complete facsimile of this manuscript as no  in its regular series and the item has been fully cataloged on a printed card a copy of this card would naturally appear beside the card for the book but it is not there some reader of the book might be much interested to know that a facsimile of the original manuscript is available in the same building but the public catalog does not help him to that knowledge if it occurs to him to go to the special file in the manuscript division or to look in the modern language association check list he will find it otherwise not this is a concrete illustration of the fact that the process of cataloging on cards cannot stop halfway or even ninetynine hundredths of the way to completion without losing much of its usefulness the problem of the incipit medieval scribes it has been remarked showed singularly little regard for the convenience of modern catalogers they were especially careless about authors and titles a given work may be ascribed in one manuscript to aristotle in another to hermes in another to egidius while in still another it is anonymous it is often difficult and sometimes impossible to determine who the real author was titles also vary a work may even have one title prefixed to the text and a somewhat different title in the colophon at the end under such circumstances it has become customary among medievalists to use the opening words technically called the incipit as a further indication of the identity of the work in many respects the incipit is more reliable than the assigned author or title but here too there are pitfalls one must learn to distinguish between the incipit of the prologue the prologue may be omitted in some copies and the incipit of the main work also if the first word say is cum a later scribe may casually write quando or quoniam or some other synonym in its place this is no help in alphabetization and one must keep such possibilities in mind when consulting indexes of incipits those indexes are extremely valuable as cataloging tools but must be used with a waryeye for verbal variants eg a g little ed initia operum latinorum quac sacculis xiii xiv xv attribuuntur  manchester university press  pp xiii  also marco vattasso initia patrum aliorumque scriptorum ecclesiasticorum latinorum  vois rome xo  incomplete never published but of great importance is b haurau initia operum scriptorum latinorum medii aevi at paris bibliothdque nationale ms nouv acquis lat  in i the library of congress attempted to secure a film copy of the dozen or so folio volumes comprising haureau compilation but there was an accidental delay and then by reason of the war the manuscripts were evacuated for safety the vatican is understood to have a handwritten copy of haurau very valuable for scientific manuscripts is the work of lynn thorndike and pearl kibre a catogue of incipits of mediaeval scientific writings in latin cambridge mass mediaeval academy of america i pp xvi as dr kuttner suggests if the library of congress would systematically record the incipits of works in all the manuscripts which it receives on film it would in time have a compilation rivaling that of hauriau
 the library quarterly the cataloger of printed books knows something of the problems of pseudonymous untitled and acephalous works but in his trade they are the exception for the cataloger of manuscripts on the contrary they might almost be said to be the rule this makes the going much rougher there was a sort of convention among scribes to give at the beginning or more often in the colophon at the end a set of data more or less corresponding to the title page of a printed book ideally this included for each treatise in the volume the author correct name the exact title the scribe name and the date and place of copying this ideal however is seldom if ever realized fortunately for the catalogers of the emergency program films the manuscripts in question have all been described in print most of them well though some of them quite badly much of the detective work therefore on the anonymous and pseudonymous treatises has been done but it is always advisable to check with more recent indexes if any have appeared in the field concerned this is time consuming work and really requires the services of a specialist in each of the major branches of manuscript study liturgy music poetry law science etc no one scholar can be a master of all the indexes catalogs and other tools in all these subjects how to head a catalog card in some of the harder cases is a problem both the vatican and the university of chicago have at times used the incipit as an entry and there are cases in which this seems to be inevitable the vatican puts the incipit in quotation marks and uses it for identification purposes but employs it only when it is not possible to refer by page and line to a printed edition of the treatise in question the chief of the preparations department at chicago writes me i may say generally that the university libraries follow closely library of congress rules in cataloging manuscripts when the manuscript has no title we have used a form title in brackets and given the incipit in a note we have used the incipit at times as the entry in a few instances an english title has been made up it will be something of an innovation in american library practice to employ the incipit as a heading and alphabetize it as if it were an author or a title such use will at times be necessary but it should be as sparing as possible it should be a last resort when author title and form title have all proved impracticable for the case in hand a useful convention following the practice of the vatican would be to place the incipit always in quotation marks with three dots following this will distinguish it at a glance from the other identity determining elements nucleus of a bibliography of manuscript studies the proposed check list cards for the films of manuscripts together with cards for similar facsimiles elsewhere in the library of congress might be organized into the nucleus of a comprehensive bibliograpy of manuscript studies a record of the published discussions of each manuscript for this there is great need and while no one living will see the task fully accomplished a practicable beginning might be made now fortunately it is not one of those enterprises which must be brought to completion before being used at all it could be added to continually and yet be immediately useful at every stage of its development if the bibliography were sharply lim letter of november i  from mr maurice f tauber
manuscripts in microfilm  ited as to content there would be no need to limit it as to dates covered or even as to languages included provided an adequate staff could be had the fundamental limitation would confine it to literary or book manuscripts rejecting archival epistolary and other occasional materials archival and occasional manuscripts were produced in staggering quantities in every century of our era but it was in the early centuries that most of the book manuscripts were produced it would be possible therefore to fix an arbitrary date limit at say  or ioo excluding from consideration any book manuscript written later and still cover the great bulk of this sort of material in the more advanced countries the number of books or literary works circulated in manuscript form after ioo falls off to a mere trickle in greece on the other hand books and treatises continued to be so circulated down into the seventeenth or even the eighteenth century the same is true of muscovite russia of china and particularly of india it would seem better therefore not to set any arbitrary limit but to include all strictly literary material of whatever date if it circulated in manuscript form as for geographical range this ultimately would be set by the number of available persons able to work in the various languages a beginning toward all this may be made with the check list cards for the emergency program films of book manuscripts if these are arranged as suggested above according to owning library and designating number they will lend themselves readily to the compilation of a card bibliography of manuscript studies the data thus accumulated should be of great assistance in the subsequent cataloging of the films concerned in fact this is the one useful halfway stage that can be envisaged between the check list or possible union catalog entry on the one hand and full library of congress catalog cards on the other the indexers of the vatican manuscripts since they were dealing chiefly with uncataloged material had little occasion to refer to previously printed descriptions when possible they referred to printed editions in which the treatise in question had been published but such publication has usually been based on some other manuscript copy the university of chicago catalogers of manuscripts in so far as i have seen their cards seem not to have given any references to printed descriptions on the other hand the catalogers of the modem language association rotographs seem to have made a point of giving such references so also did the census of medieval and renaissance manuscripts despite the summary character of many of its entries the subject cataloging divlision of the library of congress sets great store by such references and will doubtless include the more important of them on its cards if it ever undertakes to deal with manuscript materials systematically the library of congress catalogers who handled the material of the modem language association back in the days when it used photostats or photographs were accustomed to do the handsome thing in this particular they not merely referred to printed descriptions of the manuscript or rare book they copied them off by typewriter or photostat and placed the copy in the bound volume for the present program it would be possible to imitate this service by photographing the printed descriptions on pieces of film and splicing these in at the beginning of the strip but the time trouble and expense for this would be
 the library quarterly considerable it is probably sufficient merely to supply the references the bibliography that is here being suggested is not to be thought of as confined to the obvious references the films in question have usually been requested on the basis of the obvious references and any competent investigator will either know those already or know enough to look them up at once but the description let us say of add ms  in the i catalogue of additions to the manuscripts in the british museum is not the conclusion of studies on that volume it is more likely to have been the beginning in what later special catalogs has the manuscript been described what editions of texts have used it as a source what books monographs or periodical articles rely importantly on the historical evidence which it supplies it will be necessary here to exercise some discretion not every passing mention of one of these manuscripts not every casual inclusion of its number in some list deserves recording in the proposed bibliography only treatments which contribute something tangible to our knowledge of its date circumstances purpose history influence and the like should be admitted in order to secure reasonable uniformity of selection it would be advisable at least at the start to have all the references submitted to the judgment of one person or of a small group working very closely in harmony later as the field widened and the standards of the bibliography became fixed the responsibility for various sections of itparticularly for certain language groups would need to be delegated hile a trained staff for the selection and organization of matenral would be essential much could doubtless be done by voluntary co operation for example the scholars who have requested and will first use the present set of films are in most cases familiar with the previous treatments of the manuscripts in question and could supply bibliographies of them with probably less effort than anyone else how many would be willing to do so if the matter were presented to them in the right light as a disinterested effort for the convenience of all students of manuscripts the percentage of co operation should be high there would be gaps but these would not destroy the usefulness of what was recorded the control staff would of course make every effort to fill in such gaps and no scholar would be allowed to imagine that the coverage was complete a concise statement of the plans for the bibliography might be printed with each check list possibly accompanied by a few  x  printed slips on which references might be returned if scholars were asked individually to supply references on the manuscripts which they were actually using or planning to use the response would be greater than if they were appealed to generally and a bit vaguely for the good of the cause the productive scholars of the country would doubtless welcome the establishment of a central clearing house of this sort and would in time become accustomed both to consulting it and to contributing to it the fundamental arrangement of the cards would naturally be geographicalfirst by country or recognized territorial unit then by city then by library or other institution after that the classification actually used in the owning library would have to be followed whether it happened to be by collection and number by subject group and number by language group and number or by simple inventory or accession number it would be necessary of course to supply cross references for the name of
manuscripts in microfilm  every city every institution and every collection indicating the grouping under which it must be sought the obvious thing in all doubtful cases would be to follow the specifications already established by the library of congress in its cataloging of published facsimiles of manuscripts methods of expanding the bibliography if such a card bibliography proved feasible for the several thousand films of manuscripts in the emergency program there are several ways in which it could be expanded to give more complete coverage for one thing there is the extension which may naturally be expected in the copying program itself at the close of the war the program may pass over to a more or less permanent basis it might then be possible to abandon the selective principle and take consecutive runs of films for whole collections or even for whole libraries from the point of view of the photographing accessioning listing cataloging and administering of the material it would be an enormous advantage to have for example a complete reproduction instead of a scattered representation of the approximately five thousand sloane manuscripts of the british museum under the pressure of the emergency and the sense of haste this sort of choice was judged undesirable the prediction is freely made that in the course of time the library will have more films than it has printed books and as the numbers increase the need will be increasingly felt for the making of consecutive runs the day may well come though not in our lifetime when all the manuscripts in the british museum will be represented by some kind of facsimile in the library of congress in fact the ultimate goal of course is the copying of all the million or so of book manuscripts that are conjectured to exist in the libraries of the world aside from the expansion of the copying program and preferably in advance of it there is another direction in which the proposed bibliography of manuscript studies might be extended there are in the united states many other collections of copies of manuscripts some small and scattering others large and well integrated one of the outstanding examples is the film collection made with his own camera by dr sigerist the director of the institute of the history of medicine at johns hopkins university this aims to cover the ancient and the early medieval writers on medicine harvard university has a large collection of facsimiles some on paper and some on film of biblical and patristic manuscripts assembled under the inspiration of professor kirsopp lake and to a considerable extent copied with his own camera it is known as the j p morgan jr collection after the name of the original donor if cards for these and other collections could be added to the proposed card file at the library of congress its usefulness would be much enhanced even if the cards for these outside collections remained for a considerable time without the addition of bibliographical references they would still serve as an invaluable check list of material already existing in this country much needless duplication might thus be avoided a word of caution may be offered here many scholars for their own purposes have secured copies of a few pages of various manuscripts they have been collecting texts commonly in order  cf h e sigerist the medical literature of the early middle ages btdllein of the institute of the history of medicine ii i   also a continuation on pp  i

manuscripts in microfilm  lections of the biblioteca nazionale in florence it is interesting and instructive to compare his treatment with gabrieli the latter may have intentionally omitted certain catalogs existing only in manuscript form but it is hard to understand his failure to mention the fondo dei conventi soppressi with  manuscripts and the libreria del conte luigi passerini with  de ricci thus explains his method ever since ii i have been endeavoring to examine closely as many printed catalogues of manuscripts as i could lay my hands upon and the result is a collection of notes which although still in many places fragmentary already does much to cover the field my object has been for each library to draft in a few words the outline of its historical development followed by statistics as to its present holdings in manuscripts and a list of the printed and not infrequently manuscript catalogues which have been compiled at any time the order in which my notes are classified is geographical by countries and in each country alphabetical i have attempted to eliminate all repositories containing only archive material although the line is often difficult to draw my notes aim only to include publications which actually take the form of a catalogue although again in the case of libraries owning only one or a few stray items the distinction between a catalogue and a monograph is not always easy to draw what is there proposed is of course a publication in book form it is evident however that essentially the same material might be arranged on cards in the proposed bibliography of manuscript studies for each country the general catalogs of its manuscripts would first be described succinctly then those for each institution then those for each special collection and finally would come the cards for the separate manuscripts each with its own references as previously suggested the total result should be a useful and instructive survey progressing always from the general to the particular as even so learned and indefatigable a scholar as de ricci observed the task is too great for any single individual or any single institution but if properly directed it could hope to command the respect and the co operation of many individuals and many institutions the library of congress already possesses a notable collection of printed catalogs of manuscripts but the mere assembling of a file of its cards for these works would not suffice evaluation and concise historical presentation must be added in america at the present time are several of the greatest living authorities on various parts of the manuscript field and to their critical judgment the various statements could doubtless be submitted in some cases they might draw them up and for catalogs not available at the library of congress microphotography could be summoned to aid it has already been arranged to film the handwritten catalog of manuscripts at the british museum copies of other catalogs in handwritten form could also doubtless be secured from many if not all important libraries together with films of rare and unusual printed catalogs these are long term goals capable of being attained only in times of peace but even now it is doubtless well to be laying plans for them someone observing sadly the racial and cultural divisions of europe has remarked that only in america has it been possible to develop anything that can properly be termed a european race and a european civilization perhaps the compilation of a complete bibliographical catalog of the priceless manuscript records of europe also awaits american execution with the microfilm copy as the medium
