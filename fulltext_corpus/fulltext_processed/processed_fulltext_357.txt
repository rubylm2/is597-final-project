the ethical presuppositions behind the library bill of rights martin fricke kay mathiesen and don fallis the american library association ala library bill of rights is based on a foundation of ethical presuppositions in this article these presuppositions are spelled out and critically examined in light of several ethical theories for example utilitarianism natural rights theory and social contract theory we suggest that social contract theory provides the strongest argument for a right to access to information and to have that information provided by public libraries we argue however that the right to access to information is not unlimited limiting access including censorship is appropriate for example when such a limitation is necessary to protect a more fundamental right finally we argue that the ala advocacy of an unlimited right to access is based on a mistaken understanding of what follows from the fact that all of our judgments are fallible introduction the library bill of rights lbr   is well known as are many of its shortcomings  it has been argued that the lbr is ambiguous utopian political self important lacking in suitable ethical justification and unbalanced in content with too much emphasis on censorship and access and not enough on intellectual property and patron  associate professor school of information resources and library science university of arizona  east first street tucson arizona  telephone    fax   e mail mfrickeuarizonaedu  assistant professor department of philosophy massachusetts college of liberal arts north adams massachusetts  telephone    fax    e mail kmathiesmclamassedu  assistant professor school of information resources and library science university of arizona  east first street tucson arizona  telephone    fax   e mail fallisuarizonaedu  see the appendix on p  for additional information about discussions of the lbr in the library science literature library quarterly vol  no  pp   k  by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
library bill of rights  privacy    arguably the lbr should be replaced by a statement with a better form and a better foundation there are good candidates already on display such as the ala own libraries an american value  the australian library and information association statement on freedom to read  or several others listed on the free access to information and freedom of expression site  any document purporting to be an acceptable bill of rights or code of professional ethics or statement of philosophical principles should have the appropriate form and the correct foundation appropriate form includes being consistent complete and unambiguous that is it should be clear which kind of actions would count as following the rules in a particular case a code may well aspire to be both a theoretical foundation and a practical guide yet it may fall short in these roles if it is lacking suitable form but form is not enough it is quite possible to have two codes addressing the same domain that have perfect form and yet contradict each other thus there is a need to consider also justification evidence principled argument and reason in brief foundation the current lbr is based on a foundation or collection of philosophical presuppositions the purpose of this article is to discuss these presuppositions to see what is of merit in them and thus to see whether or not they should be incorporated into any new version of the lbr one conclusion that will be argued for is that several of the presuppositions have deficiencies that stem from the same root cause namely failure to deal appropriately with fallibilism fallibilism is the view that there is no certain knowledge all of our theories beliefs and opinions are always subject to the possibility of mistake and revision  the article concludes with suggestions on librarianship and fallibilism ethical theory this essay is certainly not the forum to discourse at length on ethics but at least some of the basic ethical concepts discussed in this article need to be placed in view a rights based ethic is the ethical tool of choice for the ala the lbr itself mentions rights only once but the supporting interpretation   uses rights freely perhaps too freely the following is a typical passage freedom of expression is an inalienable human right and the foundation for self government freedom of expression encompasses the freedom of speech and the corollary right to receive information these rights extend to minors as well as adults libraries and librarians
 the library quarterly exist to facilitate the exercise of these rights  users have the right to be free of unreasonable limitations or conditions  users have a right to information training and assistance  users have both the right of confidentiality and the right of privacy  rights of users who are minors shall in no way be abridged  emphasis added in order to understand and evaluate such claims we need to be clear on what rights are rights are trump cards held primarily by individuals their holders can play them to achieve certain effects or outcomes they are justified claims or entitlements against others there are negative or liberty rights requiring other people to refrain from interfering and there are positive or welfare rights making it a duty or responsibility for some other person or institution to satisfy or meet the right   this distinction is important in library settings for example if freedom of speech is a liberty right then it simply requires that others do not interfere with a person speech if it is a welfare right then it may require that others report that speech or that libraries carry documents describing it similarly if freedom to read is simply a liberty right then it only imposes on others the duty of minding their own business and not actively preventing a person from reading a document if it is a welfare right then it might require that others libraries perhaps provide the books for the reading another important distinction is that between natural or moral and legal rights natural rights pertain to all humans independent of the legal framework of the societies in which they live legal rights on the other hand are brought into being by laws and governments legal rights have a distinctly lesser standing than natural rights because laws can be unethical or wrong as they were with slavery in america and with the holocaust in nazi germany some countries the united states being a notable one have a constitution that in part purports to be a written statement of at least some of the natural rights and if a constitution is able to impinge on legal cases as it can in the united states this can lead to a mixing of natural and legal rights   in addition to natural and legal rights there is a third form of rightscontractual rights such rights may be based on actual contract or hypothetical contract that is what we would agree to if we were asked under fair conditions no force or fraud rights of citizens are frequently seen to be the result of such a hypothetical contract according to such social contract theories we have natural rights as human beings when we come together to form societies we enter into a hypothetical contract that spells out the terms of our association   section    so for instance a person may have a natural right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness but as a member of society that person might also have a right to political representation a
library bill of rights  free press and so on in short a person might have certain social or political rights that protect natural rights within a civil society further rights then arise with the formation of laws as noted above rights may also derive from actual contracts within existing societies some constituents may form themselves into a group and apparently grant rights among the members by explicit contract for example the joining of a golf club may give a golfer in the golf club terms the right to use the course and the club facilities whether these are rights or not it is clear that the association granting the rights cannot extend those rights beyond what is strictly within their purview the golf club cannot of itself give a member the right to use the golf courses of other clubs or most definitely the right to play golf on city streets rights granted by explicit contract are limited in what they require or forbid of others to those that have contracted into the group or have been subcontracted by the group and they are also constrained by wider natural or legal rights attention needs to be paid to how far any justified claims extend just what particular rights there are is a matter of debate knowledge of legal rights is reasonably definite because the law is there and knowledge of it is just a matter of seeing what it says to be fair there are questions of interpretation precedents case law and the like but still this is the easier of the two cases knowledge of natural rights is highly uncertain long standing rational debate here has suggested certain candidates such as life liberty and so forth but decent seriousminded and well intentioned folk can disagree and even when there is agreement the parties might be wrong that the constitution has been changed and that there are debates about changing it further indicates that our identification of natural rights is fallible however as we will argue in the penultimate section to the article fallibility is not a reason to abandon the attempt to identify these rights even if we will never come up with the complete and perfect list furthermore even though our knowledge of rights is fallible we do seem to have knowledge of at least some rights it seems highly unlikely that we will discover for instance that we were wrong about a person right to be free from involuntary servitude even if we were infallible in our ability to identify what our rights are we would still have a problem with what to do when rights conflict for example your right to free speech might conflict with my right not to be injured by false and unsubstantiated public statements about me the participants in conflict shouting about their rights in ever louder voices would not achieve what everyone including the participants want namely some equitable or moral solution to accommodate all parties we may resolve such conflicts in two ways first few if any
 the library quarterly rights are absolute unconditional and universal and trump everything most rights have limits or boundaries and we need to pay attention to what these limits are there may also be a priority or ranking among some rights second when rights are in conflict there may need to be an appeal to principles over and above those particular rights in order to reach a compromise or resolution rights focus on individuals to the exclusion of society and where there is apparently irresolvable conflict of rights it may be that an appeal to the interests or benefits of society can open a way forward for example lawyers before the supreme court appeal to compelling state interest as a way to modulate the occasionally antisocial consequences of unfettered individual rights claims such a concern with the common good is better expressed in the language of utilitarianism than in the language of rights according to utilitarian moral theory one ought to perform those actions or adopt those policies that produce the greatest good or utility for the greatest number of persons however just as an ethical theory that concerns itself only with rights may focus too much on the individual at the expense of society an ethical theory that concerns itself only with utility may focus too much on society at the expense of the individual thus in this article a pluralistic approach to ethical theory is adopted both utilitarian and rights based arguments are given it will be shown that on many issues both an appeal to rights and an appeal to utility will yield the same recommendation in fact rights themselves can be justified on the grounds that granting persons certain rights increases overall utility as we have seen rights can arise in a variety of ways and with a variety of strengths of justification a rights based code needs to tie appropriately into natural legal and conventional rights and possibly also to other ethical arguments for instance the ala tries in part to base the lbr on the universal declaration of human rights adopted by the united nations general assembly  this declaration has no legal or constitutional standing however and it is doubtful that the many and varied rights that it invokes are all natural rights in short it itself is in need ofjustification below we evaluate the ethical justification for the rights claims made in four of the lbr presuppositions presupposition  the dissenting opinion should be presentedarticle ii of the lbr reads libraries should provide materials and information presenting all points of view on current and historical issues materials should not be proscribed or removed because of partisan or doctrinal disapproval the value of providing the dissenting opinion has been known from antiquity john milton wrote of this value in   it
library bill of rights  is subscribed to in the us constitution first amendment and it is most famously expressed and coherently argued for in john stuart mill on liberty  a point worth noting is that mill argument for free expression of unpopular ideas is to some degree in tension with a rights based approach the expression of views that offend upset or even hurt some people is defended on the grounds of the utility to society as a whole of having a free marketplace of ideas as a result mill justification for protecting unpopular speech depends on the claim that society is better off overall if such speech is not suppressed mill argument offers a compelling justification of this presupposition expression of unpopular opinion is essential for a free public debate in a democracy and facilitating such debate is an important role for libraries see  pp   and  for other appeals to mill argument in the library science literature however as we will argue below this presupposition does not commit us to the view that all censorship is wrong presupposition  we ought not censorarticle iii reads libraries should challenge censorship in the fulfillment of their responsibility to provide information and enlightenment this presupposition seems almost a corollary of presupposition  but actually it is not and it needs to be qualified in order to do this we need to look more carefully at the possible ethical concerns with censorship the ala characterizes censorship as being the suppression of ideas and information that certain persons  find objectionable or dangerous  in the context of libraries censorship means either the exclusion or removal of objectionable or dangerous materials from a library collection or if the library has a role as an access portal the restriction of access to such materials censorship is different from the application of selection policies selection policies determine which items should be added to a library collection when it is not possible to include all available items in the collection perhaps due to budget and shelf space limitations even so the application of certain selection policies might result in de facto censorship this is all the more true with electronic documents access to items using the internet is cheap or free and it does not run into shelf space limitations the default selection policy for access using the internet yields all items any other selection policy will be a close companion to censorship there are two ethical concerns with censorship one connected with free speech and the other with autonomy first censorship suppresses free speech and free speech for the most part is good   the value of free speech is primarily that it promotes a battle among ideas in which the fittest ideas may survive to the benefit of all in society
 the library quarterly further even the most widely accepted and seemingly obvious truths benefit from continuous exposure to opposing viewpoints  in addition for social contract theorists free speech may be required for the proper functioning of voting in a democracy  p   both these lines apply most to views that can be true or false or right or wrong to science or to social or political theories for example they apply less to fiction or literature and to what might be called products or acts of free expression such as flag burning as opposed to free speech second censorship stands against the autonomy and freedom of the individual persons ought to be able to make up their own minds on what they want to read or see  the free choice argument does not stand without qualification however if you do not know the content of what you are about to read or see then you cannot make a choice about whether or not you want to read or see it so people should know what sort of thing they are going to see before they see it and thus be in a position to choose not to see it if that is their wish as a result labeling perhaps similar to that used in the film industry would be appropriate in some circumstances also if you cannot avoid something then in no sense are you being given a choice freedom requires the ability to opt out it is often assumed that we can opt out in practice the common advice is if you do not want to read that kind of material don read it and don be a busybody about other people reading it but this advice is based on a false assumption in the modern age for example in public libraries there is an issue relating to unattended public access internet computers displaying sex sites which have been selected earlier by patrons working librarians have grounds for complaint that such displays constitute a hostile work environment for them  furthermore and arguably worse bona fide members of the public may face such displays without choice and as a result they may decide to avoid the public library in other words their only way to choose not to see pornography is to choose not to go to the library at all these two arguments against censorship while they cover many cases do not encompass all types of documents or potential censors they clearly apply to what we will call macrocensorship but not necessarily to microcensorship macrocensorship is an allencompassing society wide censorship perhaps imposed by government microcensorship is a localized censorship that is imposed by an institution such as a library or bookshop or by a group of people microcensorship largely escapes or can escape the above arguments against censorship if a bookshop borders say refuses on principle to carry any books by james joyce little harm results provided there are
library bill of rights  other book sources such as barnes and noble amazoncom and others who have a ready supply of joyce fiction in such a case joyce point of view is still widely disseminated and we still have a choice to read his books if we like in addition if a library has a certain purpose or aim surely it should hold documents conducive to that aim and not hold documents not conducive to the aim especially if any holding of nonconducive documents has to be done at the expense of conducive ones no harm results from this provided there are other libraries with different aims or other sources altogether in other words while there may be a slight loss of convenience or efficiency microcensorship is perfectly consistent with an entire absence of macrocensorship furthermore neither of the above arguments against macrocensorship free speech and autonomy applies to such items as child pornography if we accept mill arguments for free speech we should not censor arguments in favor of child pornography but child pornography itself does not present an argument for a point of view while the autonomy argument seems to offer some support for an individual right to read or see whatever he wants including child pornography this right conflicts with more important rights of children and the obligation of society to protect children we must take into account the fact that children were abused in the production of these items that these items do not accord children the respect and dignity they deserve and that these items might encourage further abuse of children in this case there is a conflict in rights and a weaker right gives way to a stronger one american law is in almost perfect harmony with these ethical conclusions the first amendment and resulting case law debars macrocensorship by governments but not microcensorship by libraries clubs bookshops and so on  furthermore it allows exceptions such as obscenity as well as defamation exhortations to imminent lawlessness and protection of the national interest one standard objection to a pro censorship line is that librarians do not know the uses to which items will be put and for any document whatsoever there is conceivably an enlightening use in the case of child pornography for instance conceivably the patron might be a researcher who after working with the materials might produce a theory to explain this social ill and provide a remedy for it this what if the patron is doing research argument is common but it can be argued that it is not sound an analogy is to say that wal mart should be able to sell drugs fake green cards property stolen from others counterfeit money and the likejust in case the shopper who purchases any of these items is doing research on them psychologists perhaps forensic psychologists may indeed need access to examples of child
 the library quarterly pornography but this is not to say that libraries especially public libraries should be the institutions to provide these examples as part and parcel of their standard public offerings legal authorities should control and have sanction over the issue of items such as these just in exactly the same way as they do for marijuana for example when medical researchers are investigating the effects of illegal drugs some libraries even public libraries support research as one of their central functions for example the reading room of the british museum or the new york public library for institutions like these if the legal authorities delegate them to be custodians of some objectionable material then presumably they would and should limit access to the objectionable items to researchers entitled to them an argument can be made that even some items that might inform or enlighten should be censored for example there is some information that should be kept out of libraries not because the information itself is objectionable but because merely disseminating it or facilitating access to it would violate rights or have bad consequences in particular we might not want to disseminate some information that is subject to intellectual property or privacy restrictions suppose our entire future behavior including our health and our abilities as workers was largely determined by our genetic makeup suppose further that this genetic code could be determined for each individual and thus become part of an individual medical record as is shown in the sciencefiction film gattaca it may be that we would want to and should forbid publication of this information of course in this case we do not want to forbid publication because the information is deemed to be objectionable but rather because disseminating this information would be dangerous in particular it would have negative social utility as a result forbidding publication would still count as censorship by the ala definition even so we would again be legitimately restricting the dissemination of information on the basis of content there are even examples not involving either privacy or ownership the horrific medical experiments carried out on some inmates by prison doctors in concentration camps in nazi germany might possibly lead to theories or documents that inform or enlighten nevertheless such documents perhaps should be censored we say perhaps here because the appropriate action is by no means clear we might decide not to disseminate this information out of a desire to show respect for  what we claim here and elsewhere in this article is that there are cases in which it is legitimate to restrict access to information there is however the epistemic problem of determining exactly when in actual practice we have such a case we address this particular issue later in the section on fallibilism
library bill of rights  the victims and total abhorrence for the means of acquisition of the information such a decision would not be based on concerns about privacy or ownership of the information admittedly some of the examples that we have used in this section for example child pornography and concentration camp experiments are rather extreme as a result these examples cannot establish that it is always or even often appropriate to censor however our goal has not been to show that it is always or even often appropriate to censor our contention is that there are limitations on the unconditional principle endorsed in the lbr that we should not censor we have done so by giving examples where there is good evidence that the materials in question really are dangerous such examples indicate that there are competing values that at least sometimes override this unconditional principle as a result it seems that the ala should adopt a more moderate position that recognizes the exceptions to article iii in fact the first amendment provides an analogous example the first amendment seems to guarantee unconditionally freedom of speech and indeed in most circumstances anyone can say anything that he wants to say however there are exceptions for example one is not allowed to yell fire in a crowded theater if there is no fire in other words there are competing values for example public safety that at least in extreme cases override this principle as a result the legislative and judicial branches of government have attempted to codify the legitimate exceptions to the first amendment finally it might be objected that the fact that the lbr suffers from a few exceptions especially in such extreme cases is not a serious problem after all there are bound to be at least a few exceptions to almost any statement of principle even so it would certainly be better to have a statement of principles that better matches the intent of librarians and even though all knowledgeable people may know that child pornography is clearly a legitimate exception to the lbr prohibition of censorship it is not clear how one would ever reach this conclusion merely by reading the explicit statement of the lbr in the following sections we argue that a statement of principles for librarianship that better matches the intent and in most cases the actual practice of librarians can be based on social contract theory presupposition  access should not be restricted for certain reasons most notably agelbr article vi reads a person right to use a library should not be denied or abridged because of origin age background or views interestingly this statement does not say that access cannot be denied indeed it allows the denial of access to lots of patrons on lots of occasions and so it should occasions that spring to mind in
 the library quarterly clude when the library is closed when a patron regularly sets fire to the book drop and so on the statement concerns reasons or grounds for denying access these reasons should not include origin age background or views this list seems to be too short if a comprehensive list is the aim it does not contain for instance disabilities and the list also contains questionable items most notoriously age much ink has been spilled on the age clause in the lbr see for example   we will discuss what we take to be the reason behind the inclusion of age on the list later in this section and in the next while something needs to be said about access it is difficult to find an adequate phrasing of presupposition  part of the trouble is the diverse nature of libraries public libraries are one case but there are also libraries that are entirely different for instance special libraries like a commercial company in house library of information on its industry and its competitors or archive libraries that preserve records possibly with little or no access to those records it is hard to lay down one rule of access or denial of access suitable for all libraries the lbr is of course aimed primarily at public libraries which have a specific purpose to serve namely as we argue below to provide informative and enlightening materials to assist all people to meet their own personal conceptions of the good with public libraries it seems access should be open to all the public or all constituents by default however two issues need to be clarified  what is the source of a person right to use the library  what are the limitations on this right to access in attempting to answer these questions we will also have more to say about which material a person has a right to access sources and boundaries of access rights some see access rights as a corollary of freedom of speech rights on the grounds that if a person has a right to speak then others have a right to access that speech for example the ala writes freedom of expression encompasses the freedoms of speech press religion assembly and association and the corollary right to receive information  emphasis added but as has been pointed out already the liberty right of free speech does not of itself require the welfare right of free access however there is another approach to defending free access to information free speech is attractive following mill reasoning at least partly because of the utility to society of free discussion views are not going to be discussed unless people know what they are unless people have access so the utilitarian arguments for free speech simultaneously support free access
library bill of rights  a related argument in support of a welfare right to use public libraries might be based on the needs of our form of government a democratic society needs an informed citizenry for the democratic process to function well so the citizens have a welfare right to information about the government elections party policies and so forth thus the government has an obligation to provide that information one vehicle that governments might use to disseminate this information is the public library if they did citizens would have a right to use those libraries in this vein the library and information association new zealand aotearoa writes a basic right of citizens in a democratic society is access to information on matters that affect their lives at times the interests of the individual have to be subordinated to the interests of the community in such matters as development of energy and mineral resources industry town planning transportation etc citizens have a right to be informed of the facts involved and to participate in the decision making process for example when activities such as massive alterations to the landscape and its use are proposed the right to be informed to be consulted and to intervene is essential and fundamental to the democratic process  while it does provide some justification for a right to information the scope of this argument is rather limited for a start it applies only to citizens or more precisely voting citizens and so for example would not apply to children who are too young to vote or to resident aliens it also applies only to government information this argument does not require public libraries to carry as a matter of responsibility or duty other documents that are not part of the democratic process such as a stephen king novel or those documents relaying the latest baseball scores there is an enhancement to the democracy argument    alexander meiklejohn suggests that voters need to be wise as well as informed self government can exist only insofar as the voters acquire the intelligence integrity sensitivity and generous devotion to the general welfare that in theory casting a ballot is assumed to express  p  this wisdom is in part to come from education and exposure to novels belles lettres and poetry meiklejohn writes i believe as a teacher that the people do need novels and dramas and paintings and poems ecause they will be called upon to vote  p  in turn the access to novels and dramas and paintings and poems might be provided by public libraries as a result the premise that libraries should be involved in the creation of a wise and a well informed electorate justifies access to a wider range of materials in addition it justifies access to a wider audience for example access is opened up not merely to voters but also to would be voters such as children after
 the library quarterly all education and wisdom take some time to acquire so children can and should embark on the acquisition so as to be well equipped when they are old enough to vote meiklejohn argument improves on the previous argument from democracy the crucial question however is whether the best libraryrelated strategy for improving the wisdom of each individual voter is for the library to have extensive holdings and to allow that voter universal access to all materials it seems that the answer to this is no many of the materials held by libraries might well be wisdom producing but some of the materials clearly only have for example entertainment value if the role of public libraries is to maximize individual wisdom collectively across society however then what the libraries should do is provide access to only or at least predominantly materials that are likely to make society wiser compare  p  thus meiklejohn reasoning only justifies giving both actual and potential voters access to wisdom producing materials and to government information but it does not justify access to many of the documents that libraries often hold our hypothetical social contract argument to be presented shortly improves on the democracy arguments in two ways first it provides a justification for libraries providing access to a much wider range of materials including pure entertainment second it holds for a wider range of types of society both democracyjustifications for libraries rest on the premise that the societies in question are democracies the hypothetical social contract argument is much stronger and holds whether or not the society is democratic for example it can justify access to public libraries for societies that are monarchies and in which no one votes another approach to establishing some right to access information in libraries would be to regard the right as derived from an explicit contract similar to the golf club case then the account would be as follows there are communities of members or patrons formed from such facts as living or paying taxes in a certain country or town or attending a certain university or being in a certain professional body and so forth these patron groups would establish and have their libraries which rights patrons would have would depend on the informal or semiformal contracts between them and their libraries this argument however is also limited if the community of patrons decided to exclude persons on the basis of race or disability for example they could if such persons have no noncontractual right to access unless there is a broader justification of a natural or social right to access only those fortunate enough to be among the possibly select group of library patrons will have a right to access
library bill of rights  there is however a stronger argument that establishes both the need for libraries and delimits their nature and patrons rights concerning them it is based on the idea of a hypothetical social contract which we introduced earlier in the section on ethical theory we imagine that we are going to form a contract among ourselves to govern aspects of our society and we conjecture what the terms of that contract might be in order to ensure that the terms of the contract will be fair we imagine that the parties to the contract are denied knowledge of their actual place in society john rawls calls this the veil of ignorance  so for example a rational person who is in fact rich would not seek a social contract that favored the rich and harmed the poor because while considering the contract she has to allow for the possibility that she might be poor similarly a rational person who is in fact in perfect health would seek a social contract that encourages information provision for people with disabilities simply because for all he knows he might be a beneficiary of such a provision for more details on the style of argument that is used here see   our hypothetical social contract argument starts from the assumption that each of us has our own conception of the good that is we each have an idea of what the good life is and what is good for us as individuals based on this conception of the good we each have a more or less well thought out plan of life of course information is essential to carrying out any plan the necessary information may be different from person to person since conceptions of the good may be different in fact in a diverse society such as ours they no doubt will be different now suppose that we have to decide whether and what kind of information will be available to us as members of a society in order to ensure that this decision will be made fairly we will suppose following the aforementioned constraint that none of us knows precisely who we will be in this society behind the veil of ignorance we do not know whether we will be rich or poor male or female child or adult since none of us knows precisely who we will be in this society we do not know what conception of the good we will have thus the veil of ignorance guarantees that the result of the decision will not favor any particular person or class of persons or any particular conception of the good  diana woodward  offers a different sort of deontological argument for intellectual freedom based on immanuel kant categorical imperative however kantian arguments for ethical principles tend to make stronger and somewhat less plausible assumptions than does social contract theory also her argument only serves to defend the sort of unconditional ban on censorship that we have been criticizing in this article
 the library quarterly under these conditions each individual person would recognize and desire that society should provide the means for each to have access to information to attain his or her own conception of the good we would want to choose a principle for distributing information in society that we could accept no matter what our conception of the good turned out to be behind the veil of ignorance the individual would not know what kind of information he or she would need and he or she would like society to provide all information required for all goods sought by all individuals hence we would want society to provide public libraries which would provide the information that each member of the society needs to achieve his or her own conception of the good a corollary would be that public libraries need to provide almost all information and near universal access this argument justifies access to a much wider selection of materials than does either version of the democracy argument for example consider a book that is merely entertaining reading it is not going to make anyone a wiser voter and it certainly does not contain any government information even so access to such a book can bejustified on the grounds that reading books that are merely entertaining promotes the conception of the good of at least some and probably many members of society it may be that not all conceptions of the good should be accommodated by means of the principle chosen for distributing information in society if we contemplated from behind the veil of ignorance the possibility that we might be placed in society as child pornographers perhaps we would desire society to supply the means for sympathetic understanding and medical help rather than public libraries full of child pornography the hypothetical contract justification for a right to access guarantees access to a wider spectrum of information and to a wider audience than any of the precedingjustifications that is the utilitarian the democratic and the explicit contract arguments for example this justification guarantees access to children in any society behind the veil of ignorance you do not know what your position in society will be you may end up being a child rather than an adult trying to achieve and develop your own conception of the good thus behind the veil of ignorance you will decide that children should have access to the information that they need in order to do so however the hypothetical contractjustification does not necessarily guarantee children access to all library materials parents have a reason to keep their children from accessing information that is harmful to them a further discussion of this point and a limited defense of paternalism are presented in the next section similarly behind the veil of
library bill of rights  ignorance you may quasi paternalistically decide that certain materials should not be available to you should you happen to be a child in this society for example it is reasonable for you to conclude behind the veil of ignorance that it is best for children not to have access to pornography even if you end up being a child who wants such access limits of access rights so it seems that in general there is a strong argument for a broad but not unlimited right to access but what exactly are the limits of this right in other words under what conditions would it be permissible to restrict access there seem to be at least five factors to consider in producing a principled system to restrict access  positive inclusions limited or unlimited versus negative exclusions limited or unlimited  voluntary versus involuntary features of patrons  the mission of the library  the interests of the intellectual property owners and  the interests of the patrons the lbr tries to list reasons that cannot be used for denial of access such as origin age and so on it does not say that only these reasons cannot be used but that limitation seems to be presupposed this limitation is awkward for the reasons mentioned earlier the list is clearly incomplete for example no mention of persons with disabilities and at the same time possibly overreaching for example the inclusion of age alternatively a positive list could be given of reasons that could be used for denial of access such as actions or behaviors that inhibit or prevent the library from discharging its mission generally a positive list is better than a negative one in that it provides guidance to the librarian who is the person making the decisions to restrict access with respect to features of patrons we might distinguish between involuntary features that a patron might have such as age or gender that are not within the patron control and voluntary features which are within the patron power to bring about or avoid so for instance age and gender are involuntary a patron who is thirty five years old just is thirty five and cannot simply choose to be twenty five years old no matter how much he would wish it being drunk or being aggressive and disruptive are behaviors or conditions that are voluntary the distinction can be stated simply as that between what a patron is and how he behaves there is something odd about denying access to anyone who is genuinely a member of the library constituency on the basis of an involuntary feature the reason is that there is nothing that the patron can do about it in contrast the use of a voluntary feature to deny access seems entirely in order if a person can choose to be drunk or not and if patron drunkenness stands in the way of the effective functioning of the library for its other patrons then it seems
 the library quarterly fine for a library to deny access to drunk patrons similarly the person who sets fire to the book drop of a public library should be barred because success in burning down the library would mean that no one would have access another example is that it may sometimes be necessary to limit access on the basis of a voluntary feature in order to prevent harm to intellectual property owners a person who enters a library and regularly copies too much might reasonably have access restricted in order to prevent undue harm to the owners of the intellectual property the distinction and its use can be a bit murky over what is voluntary and what is not an alcoholic might argue that he simply has to be drunk and further since he is a citizen and a voter he should have access to government information in public libraries all this means though is that there may be disagreement over which features fall on which side of the distinction not over the distinction itself and its use finally we should note that while there are prima facie reasons not to deny access on the basis of an involuntary feature there seem to be at least some cases where access should be denied on the basis of an involuntary feature for example if part of a library collection is unsuitable for children young people might be excluded from that part on the grounds that access could hurt them public libraries are typically a composite of children suitable and not children suitable material and as we argued above children really only have a right to access one part in this case access is denied in order to prevent harm to the patron herself presupposition  paternalism should be avoidedfear of paternalism lies behind lbr forbidding age to be used as grounds for excluding access  paternalism is one person or a group of people taking it upon him or herself to help or even compel another person or group of people to attain a positive end or to avoid a negative one  parentalism is perhaps a less objectionable word for this concept however paternalism is the standard term paternalism usually involves the ones that are being paternal deciding what is best on behalf of the others usually without their consent paternalism in general where the subjects of the paternalism are fully developed citizens is not desirable complete moral agents should be allowed to decide for themselves especially if they are in a position to make an informed choice librarians are wise to mind their own business except to provide the information to form the basis of the informed choices but where the receiving group is less than fully competent by virtue of being young infirm mentally ill and so on then a defense can be made for paternalistic action both for promoting good and for avoiding harm 
library bill of rights  in the case of information and children for instance everyoneincluding librarians parents and the rest of society agrees that paternalistic action is in order the issue just becomes who it is that should fulfil the paternal role librarians say not us let it be the parents the ala writes librarians and governing bodies should maintain that parents and only parents have the right and the responsibility to restrict the access of their children and only their children to library resources parents or legal guardians who do not want their children to have access to certain library services materials or facilities should so advise their children librarians and governing bodies cannot assume the role of parents or the functions of parental authority in the private relationship between parent and child  and recognizing that libraries cannot act in loco parentis ala acknowledges and supports the exercise by parents of their responsibility to guide their own children reading and viewing  in general parents are the right people to be paternal or the most paternal to their children but not always as the saying goes it takes a village to raise a child and really librarians are and should be among the most respected elders of the village educating children is in part the responsibility of the state and is carried out most obviously through the schools but public libraries are part of the state means of providing education for the populace and thus librarians need to play a positive role in deciding and promoting whatever is educationally desirable and on the negative side if the parents are not appropriately paternal as with those parents who abuse their children the state can and should step in if the parents are not present to be paternal a stranger might even act paternally for instance a stranger mightand indeed should stop a child from sticking a fork in a light socket to do so is not to usurp the role of the parents but to act as an empathetic human being concerned to watch out for children when parents cannot or do not it is reasonable to assume that no parents want their child to stick a fork in a light socket and if the parents did want their child to do so this would give us reason to think the parents unfit it is reasonable to assume that parents would not want their child accessing hard core pornography thus by stopping a child from accessing such material you are not taking over from the parent you are helping the parent librarians should not stand by and watch a child electrocute herself let alone help the child find a fork which seems to be the present ala policy   there are many issues here and the whole area is complex and subtle but there is an ethical role for librarians and there are parental responsibilities that librarians should try to meet as john berry puts it nor must we deprive children of the nurture the helping hand
 the library quarterly the guidance the tools for seeking truth and knowing when it is discovered we cannot simply turn them loose in our jaded information society without helping them understand that some of the information is false is evil is dangerous is misleading or is ambiguous that may not be a legal obligation but it is clearly a moral duty for every librarian every teacher every parent and person in a free society  fallibilism practical action and librarianship one conjecture made here is that inadequacies in the ala responses to most ethical issues concerning information stems from a failure to deal adequately with fallibilism as was stated in the introduction fallibilism is the view that there is no certain knowledge all our theories beliefs and opinions are always subject to the possibility of mistake and revision the ala correctly takes a fallibilist stance but then it does not deal appropriately with the consequences of this stance fallibilism impacts on information ethics in a variety of ways take censorship for instance if you censor items then as a fallibilist you know full well that some of the items you exclude perhaps should not be censored equally some of the items you do not censor perhaps should be censored labeling is another case if you label a document true or interesting for adults supported by the evidence or pure prejudice and so on then it may well be that the labels are mistaken and the document should be labeled false or not interesting for adults not supported by the evidence or mainstream and so on the same holds true for access if you are a fallibilist you know that you may well exclude some people who should not be excluded and fail to exclude some who should be or if you are considering paternal action it may turn out that a specific act of paternalism or even a particular paternal policy is inappropriate the ala response to fallibilism is to propose that we not make any judgments or choices or decisions at all they wish not to censor anything not to label anything not to deny anyone access and never to act paternally  presumably this is because they believe that this strategy will allow them to avoid error and a number of practical headaches this response is a mistake consider as an analogy the criminal offense of murder and the trials convictions and sentences of murderers we all know there are wrongful convictions for murder and also that there are failures to convict people who have committed murder the legal process is fallible what is the conclusion to be drawn here and the strategy to be adopted it is not to do away with trials and the laws against murder
library bill of rights  altogether rather it is to institute a system of checks and balances suitable to the consequences of the decisions the reason for continuing to have a law against murder and to prosecute suspected murderers is to put it bluntly that it is better to incarcerate the occasional innocent man or to let the occasional murderer go free than it is to have a society in which murders can be committed without sanction the same goes for libraries and librarianship it is better to make the occasional mistake in censoring labeling excluding or acting paternally than it is to have a system of anything goes which is what the lbr seems to commit us to with respect to for example access to the internet the hard part is to design a system of checks and balances that accommodates decision making in a fallible world mill had something to say about fallibilism and censorship he noted that fallibilists have to give all decisions their best shot they just make their decisions under uncertainty and move on  p  so he considered why could not censors just give the decision as to which books needed burning their best shot and then strike the matches he rejected this possibility because the notion of a good decision or the best attempt under uncertainty assumes that all information or opinion is available to be factored into the decision once books start to be burned that assumption no longer holds best shots rapidly would cease to be best shots hence a fallibilist cannot be a censor but and here is the crucial but mill was assuming that the books that might be burned contained true or false views or information or criticisms of views or explanations or ascriptions of causality in short content that might bear cognitively or epistemologically on the fallible decisions but artifacts like child pornography are just not of this kind so mill argument cannot be used for a sweeping rejection of censorship thus we can revert to a censorship of items with no potential to inform or enlighten based on fallible decisions see also  the vivid metaphor and occasional actual practice of book burning is unfortunate in that it is irreversible which a reasonable system of censorship would not be for the most part decisions in librarianship are not irreversible and they do not have horrific consequences this makes decisions easier a decision made today can be changed if need be tomorrow or next year librarians should not be paralyzed at the possibility of wiping out humankind by making an incorrect decision even if there are cases where we should decide to censor there is the important question of exactly who the authorities are who should be making this decision a fear about who the authorities are seems to be a real part of the rationale for the ala position on censorship  librarians seem not so much concerned about censorship per se
 the library quarterly but more about the need to avoid pressure groups from the community foisting their own views on a library holdings or selection policy this is a fear about who should decide coupled with a view that the decision makers should definitely not be a capricious pressure group the worry about who the censoring authorities should be is analogous to a worry that people might have about the crime of murder that is who should make the decision as to whether or not a particular person should be convicted of murder how do we avoid having such decisions made in a capricious manner the answer to these worries is much the same in both cases in the case of criminal offenses we have developed a set of guidelines for example trial procedures that are designed so that the right people are usually convicted in addition there is evidence and justification for the claim that following these guidelines will bring about this goal within the framework of our constitutional rights also we have a group of trained professionals principally judges and lawyers who are able to insure that these guidelines are followed in a consistent manner thus we are usually able to avoid capricious decisions in courts of law in the case of libraries we already have the trained professionals with the experience to carry out such a set of guidelines namely librarians what is still needed is a codification of a defensible set of guidelines for the operation of libraries that is a new lbr that sits on a firm foundation that is what this essay calls for conclusion in this essay we have identified four of the presuppositions that lay behind the lbr each of these presuppositions is an unconditional rule about how libraries should operate for three of these presuppositions we have argued that there are actually exceptions to these rules contrary to presupposition  we have argued that there are materials that should be excluded from libraries because they are objectionable andor dangerous contrary to presupposition  we have argued that there are cases where access should be denied on the basis of involuntary features such as age contrary to presupposition  we have argued that there are cases where libraries and librarians should be paternalistic as a result these presuppositions seem to need qualification and the admission of exceptions or shades of gray in addition we have hypothesized that the reason that ala members have adopted unconditional rules is that they are worried about making mistakes with respect to presupposition  they seem to be worried
library bill of rights  about excluding the wrong materials with respect to presupposition  they seem to be worried about denying access to the wrong people with respect to presupposition  they seem to be worried about inappropriately usurping the role of a parent we have argued however that these unconditional rules are an inappropriate response to our fallibility instead the library community should be endeavoring to develop a more subtle set of guidelines toward this end we have suggested that a more adequate lbr might be founded on social contract theory some argue that librarians are already acting in accordance with a more subtle set of guidelines than is currently codified in the lbr  in our modest opinion what librarians currently do by way of selection policies and day to day procedures is to a large extent fine and would be supported by the arguments offered here the objection of this essay is to what the librarians say they do or say they ought to do as codified in the lbr and its interpretation appendix the precursor of the library bill of rights is the original library bill of rights of the public library of des moines http   wwwpldminfoorg last accessed january   and http wwwpldminfoorgrightshtm last accessed january   the summer  issue of library trends is devoted to the library bill of rights several of the articles in this issue are cited here and the articles   were used as background there is a summary of this issue at http edfulisuiucedupuboffcatalogtrends  html last accessedjanuary   the issue contains a fivehundred item bibliography on the lbr from chris schladweiler  there is an account of how the lbr affects the day to day work of librarians at the nebraska library commission a fresh look at the library bill of rights html file httpwwwnlcstateneus freedomfreshlookhtml last accessed january   references  american library association library bill of rights httpwwwalaorgwork freedom lbrhtml last accessed january    american library association interpretations of the library bill of rights html file url httpwwwalaorgworkfreedominterprthtml last accessed january    the library bill of rights library trends  summer
