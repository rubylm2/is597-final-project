improving the leadership skills of pre service school librarians  recommendations the recruitment of pre service school librarians it is often perceived that the role of school librarians is limited to activities such as providing reference services and checking out books alexander smith  carey  hartzell  the applicants were all chosen because their responses to the pre assessment indicated that they understood the importance of the role of school librarians in schools and had the aptitude to fulfill these roles in an exceptional manner from this it can be asserted that the pre assessment achieved its purpose because the participants were all current teachers who answered the questions based on their personal experiences and perceptions the questions on the pre assessment were designed to identify teacher leaders who wanted to be school librarians who are leaders it is feasible that the applicants current positions as teachers influenced their responses because the program directors were able to identify a process appropriate for distinguishing candidates with strong leadership potential this can be concluded because the participants high scores on the lpi and the positive relationship that the leadership pre assessment had with the enabling others to act lp subscale signify that teachers with strong leadership potential were chosen this study shows that leadership preassessments for school librarians can be instrumental in helping school librarianship faculty school library administrators and principals identify the motives of students who are entering the field this is important because experienced teachers often gravitate to school librarianship as a way to leave the classroom everhart  yet it is important to recruit teacher leaders who want to move beyond the perception that school librarians have limited responsibilities each individual who seeks to be a school librarian should be aware of the professional guidelines and the important roles that school librarians have before they choose to enter the profession counseling prospective school librarians can increase the quality of education offered to students teaching school librarians to be leaders one cannot ignore the effect of the leadership instruction that the participants received during the program the skills that the participants stated they acquired as shown in table  coincide with the assertions of numerous researchers that state that leadership skills can be learned copeland  chance  feidler  kouzes  posner  these findings support the notion that some leadership skills may be innate burns  however instruction can improve them according to glickman gordon and ross gordon  teachers are conservative professionals because of this several advocates have promoted teaching risk taking skills to teachers in order for them to spark instructional reform leinwand  while the overall scores of the participants on the total lpi and its subscales were high a closer look at the average lpi subscale scores indicated that there were some weak areas in the scores of the participants these weak areas were the challenging the process and inspiring a shared vision subscales risk taking is a part of the challenging the process subscale developing and promoting a shared vision can be part of a risk taking behavior for an educator who may not want to appear to counteract school norms the results of this study imply that it would be helpful to teach school librarians how to cope with change take risks and ways to promote shared visions it is essential for school librarians to acquire these skills because school librarians interact with the entire school community in highly visible instructional settings that affect student achievement school librar
 journal of education for library and information science ians need to make a difference in their school communities by promoting their vision for the programs they offer and taking risks to explore new instructional techniques improving the assessment the school library journal ala and aasl help pre service and current librarians improve their leadership skills by offering them professional development the project lead directors introduced another option by creating a researchbased curriculum that also addressed professional practice the instruction offered to the study participants was important because teaching experience may not provide aspiring school librarians with transformational leadership experiences as shown in the results of this study even adept teacher leaders need to be introduced to transformational leadership skills that support the roles of school librarians by examining table  one can deduce that pre service school librarians can be taught transformational leadership behaviors that are consistent with the nbpts  standards empowering learners aasl  and the standards for initial preparation of school librarians ala  aasl  one way to ensure that pre service school librarians understand the standards is to offer them pre assessments during their degree programs the results signify that the pre assessment of leadership potential and instruction was effective however making a few changes to the pre assessment could have provided better evidence of the pre assessment and program success for example the pre assessment was developed without consideration for how it could have been used after the students completed the degree program in hindsight it would have been useful to have the participants submit another principal rubric and answer the questions on the preassessment again this post assessment could have been used to determine how the participants viewpoints about school librarianship changed during the program moreover the principals would have been able to provide input about the participants leadership development another change that could have been made to improve the pre assessment was to include a tool such as the lp to measure transformational leadership traits kouzes and posner  developed a leadership workbook for facilitating transformational leadership skill improvement pre service school librarians as well as veteran school librarians returning for refresher courses should be encouraged to complete the workbook the lpi could then provide them with feedback from an easy to administer reliable and valid tool taking a few minutes to assess leadership before and after a school librarianship program of study could potentially mean the difference between school librarians who think they understand leadership and those who know how to build upon their leadership strengths and improve their weaknesses conclusion this study was limited to thirty preservice school librarians although the number of respondents was small the results encompass the entire population of a unique group of teacher leaders who were educated to become school librarian leaders the admissions process which included a leadership pre assessment was also unique although the results may not be generalizable to the overall population of school librarianship students in the united states they have implications for the recruitment and training of school librarians based on the results it can be concluded that counseling pre service school librarians throughout their degree programs based on leadership pre assessments can prepare them to be the resilient change agents who are depicted in school librarianship professional standards
