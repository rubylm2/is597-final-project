 the library quarterly therefore more expensive since original cataloging may take longer to perform i suspected that there might be a countertrend toward incomplete cataloging because there is growing evidence of it in the oclc database i thought it might be possible that the recession of  which still lingers in the oil producing states some of the great plains farm states and in parts of the rust belt had caused libraries to retrench by replacing professionals with cheaper labor and by using incomplete cataloging i suspected that the advent of oclc and the use of lc cataloging copy might have reduced the cost of cataloging to test the validity of these assumptions i did three things  conducted a comparative sampling of lc copy in the national union catalog pre  imprints and the national union catalog  and then compared the two samplings on the basis of length and complexity of lc cataloging copy  conducted a mail survey in the form of a questionnaire to  of the largest academic libraries in the country and tabulated the results and  conducted research on historical cataloging costs and historic salary figures appearing in the professional literature since  and compared them with the rate of inflation since that time until the present  some of these assumptions turned out to be valid and some turned out to be false i length and complexity of catalog copy in order to determine whether cataloging copy is growing progressively longer and more complex two samplings were taken one from the national union catalog pre  imprints and the other from the national union catalog  which contains examples of cataloging done in  the latter is the last annual set of nuc compiled in print form the subsequent volumes of nuc are in microfiche form and are much too difficult to work with for sampling purposes for the  sampling the last volume of a letter sequence was selected and the cataloging copy was counted going from back to front of each letter sequence in order to avoid the initialisms which are found in front of each letter sequence where the catalog cards are not really typical of most cataloging the one hundredth two hundredth three hundredth and four hundredth examples of lc monographic cataloging were counted and photocopied only library of congress monographic cataloging copy was counted no nuc copy or library of congress copy for periodicals was selected there were not one hundred examples of lc copy in the letter x volume for  and no samples were selected there were only enough examples for the three hundredth sample to be counted for the letter q sequence there were then four samples for each letter of the alphabet except three samples for the letter q and none at all for
historic cataloging costs  the letter x making a total of ninety nine samples in all taken from the nuc  to make the samplings parallel only ninety nine samples of catalog cards were taken from the national union catalog pre  imprints and the counting backward was done from the third from the last volume instead of the last volume as was done for the nuc  again only lc catalog copy was selected each example had either an lc card number in the lower right hand corner or library of congress printed in the lower left hand corner no examples with cropped bottoms were used again all of the examples were photocopied after the samples were copied from the nuc  they were searched in the oclc database of the ninety nine samples from nuc  thirteen were not in the oclc database these thirteen samples were in japanese chinese korean hebrew and greek and were not transliterated into the latin alphabet as lc usually does now for cyrillic cataloging for the samples taken from the nuc  and searched for machine readable cataloging copy in the oclc database certain characters letters and numerals were counted in measuring record length that were not counted for the samples in the pre  imprints these characters are the information input into a machine readable workform for example eng in the language fixed field it is legitimate to count this information and to compare lc cataloging in machine readable form with cataloging done in the past not in this form because the new way represents an additional burden imposed on contemporary catalogers that catalogers twenty five years ago did not have to bear however characters in the fixed fields or in the variable fields that are printed on every standardized workform and require no input by a cataloger were not counted examples of these characters are type repr indx in the fixed fields and  in the variable fields to measure the length of cataloging copy all of the characters and all of the punctuation except diacritical marks were counted on each catalog card or printout the total was recorded and the average number of characters for all ninety nine cards was calculated this information is found in table  complexity in cataloging may be defined as the number of entries and fields on a catalog card together with the information either in the body of the card or the note area used to justify making these entries the complexity of cataloging copy was measured by counting the following characteristics of complexity the number of entries to lc catalog cards in both the pre  imprints and the nuc  the number of authortype entries personal author corporate author editors translators illustrators the number of title type entries parallel title uniform title title traced differently the number of series entries the number of subject entries the number of subject heading subdivisions and the

historic cataloging costs  ture manufactures and mines and quarries by  the census for population alone had grown to  volumes  there is a trend toward greater volume and complexity in materials libraries acquire and the cataloging of this material reflects this trend the cataloging becomes longer and more complex also ii cataloging cost questionnaire in order to determine what present day cataloging costs are whether the depression of   has caused libraries to try to cut costs and how important libraries consider cataloging costs a cataloging cost questionnaire was composed and sent to  of the largest academic libraries in the united states of these  libraries  replied for a response rate of  percent a copy of the questionnaire appears in appendix a and a list of the responding libraries appears in appendix b the questions and their answers are presented in table  what is surprising about the answers to question  is the large number of libraries still using only a card catalog the replies to question  indicate that the suspicion that the recession of   had caused libraries to worry about cataloging costs is largely unfounded the most remarkable finding from the answers to question  is that most academic libraries are unable or unwilling to state their cataloging costs only a minority have either an exact or a rough idea of costs three libraries sent in information that was not usable two sent in their cataloging costs minus salary and wages for personnel and one sent in its total cataloging costs for both monographs and serials but not divided by either the number of volumes or the number of titles these three replies were not counted thirty four libraries answered this question in a variety of ways for some the answer was given in cost per volume and for others in a cost per title some gave a figure for copy cataloging and another for original cataloging for these libraries the cost for copy cataloging was used in finding the average cost of the thirty four libraries other libraries gave a range of figures for example  per volume and for these libraries the lower figure was used some libraries gave one figure for both monographs and serials for libraries that lumped cataloging costs for both monographs and serials into one figure the highest figure was  and the lowest was  for libraries giving separate figures for monographs the range was from  for original cataloging at one university to a low of  for copy cataloging at another the average cost of cataloging is given for thirty four cases but only seven libraries gave separate figures for serials cataloging cost because this number is so low no average will be given a warning must be given about the above figures the phrase

 the library quarterly answered in this way because they felt that quality was the correct answer but a surprising number value quantity highly some of the results of the cataloging cost questionnaire were to be expected and some were surprising most academic libraries use oclc but several use more than one bibliographic utility a surprisingly large number of colleges and universities  percent still use only a card catalog for their public catalog and a large number use both cards and on line  percent cataloging costs are of only moderate concern to most academic libraries  percent and this was a surprise most academic libraries  percent were not able or were unwilling to report what their cataloging costs are the average cataloging cost in   for monographs in academic libraries that know their cataloging costs is  per volume in most cases but this figure is only a conservative rough estimate very few libraries are doing anything to control costs only  percent are engaged in cooperative cataloging the most used method to control costs is to use cheaper labor but only  percent of libraries are doing this most libraries deny trying to phase out professionals there is a small trend  percent toward libraries doing less than aacr cataloging but the library of congress admits that it too is going to do this for certain books most libraries polled value quality first in cataloging but  percent value quantity as either first or second in importance ii historic cataloging costs the library profession organized itself in  with the establishment of the american library association and the advent of libraiy journal its first professional journal the very first volume of libraryjournaltcarries an article by charles a cutter which defends the need for a library catalog as opposed to bibliographies listing books that a library may not have cutter gives cataloging costs for an unnamed large library as  per volume and for an unnamed small public library as  per volume he says that at most cataloging would cost  to make and  more to print  at this time library catalogs were printed in book form and were not yet in card catalog form in addition to being the first american article on cataloging costs this article is important for being the first to notice that cataloging costs are greater for large libraries than for small ones and that the difference in cataloging costs varies enormously in this case by  percent from one library to another nine years later in  another article on cataloging costs appeared in libray journal the author james l whitney director of the boston public library reports the cost of cataloging and classification of books at his library at  per volume when he wrote his article printed
historic cataloging costs  book catalogs were being replaced by card catalogs in addition to the figures for the boston public whitney mentions cataloging cost figures for three unnamed libraries and they are respectively   and  per volume the first figure is for a printed book catalog and the last two are for manuscript card catalogs the boston public itself was using two different types of catalogs at the time a printed book catalog for english fiction which was already in its seventh edition and a card catalog for books in the bates hall collection  william warner bishop of the princeton university library gives no statistics for the princeton library in  but does cite specific costs at the john crerar library as reported by its librarian  for the labor costs of cataloging plus an additional  for printing the catalogs for a total cost of  he does not say whether this cost is a per title cost or a per volume cost bishop is also the first librarian to state in print that comparative cataloging cost studies are unsatisfactory he says that the cost studies have little value because there are too many varying processes and practices involved in different libraries for the comparative cost studies to measure the same thing  despite bishop complaints about the validity of comparative cataloging costs surveys the american library association committee on cost of cataloging sponsored a cataloging test in  and  it sent out questionnaires to thirty eight libraries only eighteen libraries however took part these libraries were to take  titles of average difficulty and to compute the cost of cataloging classification shelf listing and preparation of cards based on the salaries of the people involved the purpose of the test was to find a cost for each of four different types of libraries that was to be both empirical and prescriptive for costs at other libraries the results of the test were as follows three large libraries reported average cataloging costs of  four university libraries reported average cataloging costs of  seven large public libraries reported average cataloging costs of  and four small libraries reported cataloging costs of    the university figures were too low to be credible even at the time they were reported this unlikely average was caused by the figures reported by columbia and yale columbia reported a figure of  per title and yale a cost of  per title  both libraries were called upon to explain their unbelievable costs harriet b prescott spoke on behalf of columbia she admitted that columbia average cost of cataloging was  per title not  but she did not explain how she arrived at the nine and ahalfcent figure she reported for the test sara g hyde said on behalf of yale that they turned the test into a race that they counted only time spent at desk and typewriter not time spent looking things up that the books were easier than the usual ones that  percent of the books they did for the test were unclassed and others required only a single letter for
 the library quarterly classification she admitted that yale cost per title in   was really  not  as reported on the test the cataloging test was not a success then because some of the participants misunderstood the purpose of the test and because there was no agreement on standards and terminology  illinois collected cataloging statistics for the years   and calculated that its cataloging costs were  per volume during this period  the next statistics available for academic libraries are provided by mccrum who gives the figures for grinnell iowa state and california as being respectively   and  in   during the s and s the idea that cataloging costs could include other things besides salaries and wages of the catalogers appeared reichmann gives credit to jennie t jennings and her ala committee in  for originating six factors that should be included in compiling true cataloging costs administration equipment conditions of work hours of work procedure statistics and cooperative cataloging  fremont rider built on this idea in  and said that administration and overhead should be calculated as part of cataloging costs by which he meant rent or cost of housing the catalog department heating lighting water telephone costs printing stationery and postage depreciation insurance janitorial services and building repairs rider in  gives two figures for cataloging costs at his library wesleyan one for labor  per volume and a second figure  per volume for labor plus overhead including all the aforementioned items  in  r a miller did a time and cost analysis using data from the university of iowa and came up with the figure of only  per volume for cataloging an unusually low figure for its time  jerrold orne collected cataloging cost statistics at washington university in st louis for three years from   through   and claimed that he reduced cataloging costs from  to  in    john minto dawson wrote a dissertation at the graduate library school of the university of chicago which was published as an article in  he found that cataloging costs for eleven university libraries in  varied from  to  per title he also considered the feasibility of centralized cataloging for research libraries in addition to that done by lc he found that there was sufficient duplication in the ordering of materials by nine research libraries to justify centralized and cooperative cataloging among them he also studied the use of lc cataloging copy by the nine research libraries and found that they subjected lc copy to more revisions than he considered necessary both in descriptive cataloging and in subject headings and call numbers he felt that fewer changes would result in cheaper but still usable copy dawson also advocated that lc as the only functioning centralized
historic cataloging costs  cataloging center in the united states at the time catalog more foreignlanguage materials for the benefit of research libraries dawson foresaw the usefulness of centralized and cooperative cataloging but he could not foresee the inventions that would make them possible in their current form oclc rlin etc a few years later  as fussler has noted more recently lc has in fact done what dawson recommended and gone beyond the recommendation with its national program of acquisitions and cataloging  felix reichmann cites two later sets of cost statistics one for  per volume from california at berkeley in  and the other for  per title from columbia in      catherine macquarrie did a cataloging cost survey of school academic and public libraries in southern california in  and came up with a large mass of statistical information her figures for six college libraries are reported in both per volume costs and per title costs the range of per volume costs was from  to  with an average of  per volume the range of per title costs was from  to  with an average of  per title macquarrie is the only librarian who has claimed that average costs should be prescriptive she says that average costs should be a check and a goal  this is true however only for libraries that closely resemble one another in size budget clientele and location ichiko t morita and d kaye gapen did a before and after oclc study of cataloging costs at ohio state from  through  they compared pre oclc cataloging with oclc cataloging they found that in   percent of their library cataloging was quick editing with an average cost of  per title and  percent of its cataloging was original cataloging with an average of  per title in  with oclc the quick editing had grown to  percent of their library cataloging with an average cost of  per title and the original cataloging had fallen to  percent of the work with an average cost of  per title if one makes allowance for the difference in percentages the average costs then were  per title in  and  per title in  an increase of  percent they conclude that if it had not been for the high rate of inflation during this period cataloging costs would have fallen  and they are quite correct for the wholesale commodity price index rose during the period that morita and gapen studied from  of the  base figure in  to  in  an increase of  percent  the cataloging cost figures calculated by morita and gapen in  and  are the latest figures to appear in the literature and the absence of more recent statistics necessitated the cataloging cost survey which appears in section ii where the latest cataloging cost figure is  for   if the  cataloging cost figure of  is representative and the  figure for   is valid cataloging
 the library quarterly costs have increased  percent during the past  years the above figures all appear in table  salary statistics table  is a comparison among four sets of figures first all of the available cataloging costs that have been published in the literature have been listed chronologically these cataloging costs are mostly for large libraries or academic libraries when available an attempt has then been made to supply a salary figure for the year of each cataloging cost with preference given to figures for salaries of large academic libraries salary statistics are rare in the early days of the library profession the first figures available come from pratt institute which began taking a survey of its graduates and their salaries in  and found that its graduates had an average salary of  in  and of  in   today these salaries seem to be unusually low but in the context of their time they were quite high the country was experiencing a severe depression in  salaries for other occupations were much lower for example the average wage in manufacturing was  in  and  in  school teachers averaged only  per year in  and in the same year federal postal employees were really well paid at an average of   this average for pratt graduates is probably not typical of librarians as a whole because pratt graduates find jobs primarily in the new york metropolitan area where salaries historically have been higher than salaries nationwide for example salary statistics gathered by ala in  indicate that new york and brooklyn paid higher salaries to school librarians than did akron denver indianapolis louisville oakland or washington  salary statistics gathered by ala in  for public librarian salaries indicate that new york and brooklyn paid higher salaries than did baltimore dallas houston indianapolis new orleans and toledo  the next published salaries were those of five academic libraries which participated in the ala cataloging test the identity of only two is known and their salaries for   are as follows no   no   no  columbia  no   no  yale  average  the average salary for these five libraries was  in    salaries increased considerably during the s and so did published salary statistics but during the great depression salaries experienced their first decline for example  percent of pratt institute graduates

 the library quarterly suffered salary cuts between  and   during the s and the s ala collected salary statistics from several prestigious colleges and several large state universities and published them in the ala bulletin usually on one full page or more in the form of a large table according to various categories of workers such as department heads professional assistants and occasionally other groups such as catalogers ala did not find a one figure average for all of the groups of professional librarians in all of the libraries i have done this however and the results are found in table  for the years between  and  inclusively this one figure average does not include nonprofessional assistants or library directors because ala omitted the latter from the earliest tables these salary figures reduced to one figure are as follows for  the average university library salary was   for    for    for    and for    maurice seay collected salary statitics from sixty three members of the association of land grant colleges and universities and of the national association of state universities and published a table of salary statistics whose average for the academic year  was   for the year  and for the years   the salary scale tables for the university of california berkeley have been used and like the earlier ala tables reduced to a one figure average by the author california was selected because its salary scale was published and available not because its salary scale is typical the university of california berkeley average salary for the year  was   for    and for    a survey of academic librarians salaries was taken by theodore samore for   and again a table of salary statistics has been reduced to one number the average salary for academic librarians for   was   for the year  ala again conducted a salary survey but this time it did not give statistics by universities instead it took figures from personal members and published the average salaries by various categories of librarians the average salary for librarians in university libraries in  was   ala took another survey for academic librarians in   and the average academic librarian salary was   the association of research libraries began publishing salary figures in the s and began ranking the top  of its member libraries in order of their median salary for the year  the university of houston held the median position of number  out of  libraries and its salary was  the arl also found that the average salary including the directors salaries was  historically the salary of the director has been as much as or even more than three times that of the lowest paid professional so that adding the
historic cataloging costs  directors salaries in with the other figures raises the average considerably  the most recently published salary figures were compiled by ala for   these figures give mean salary by eleven job titles and for five regions i selected eleven mean salaries for university librarians and by averaging these extracted an average salary of  if the  and  salary figures are representative of librarians salaries then salaries have increased  percent in the past ninety years measurements of inflation in addition to the figures for the cost of cataloging and the salary figures in table  there are two sets of figures by which to measure the rate of inflation chronologically the wholesale commodity price index and the price of gold the base year for the wholesale commodity price index is  which equals  all of the fluctuating figures are in relation to prices in this year the figures for the wholesale commodity price index from  through  are taken from the golden constant by roy w jastram  the figure for  is taken from the statistical abstract of the united states   and for  from the world almanac and book of facts   the price of gold was fixed by the us government from  to  at  per ounce and at  an ounce afterward  ownership of gold by us citizens was illegal between   and   the price of gold on the london exchange began to rise in   and in  when americans were allowed to own gold again the price rose to  per ounce  it reached a peak of  per ounce briefly in  when inflation was high  but it declined thereafter to its  price of  per ounce  the statistics for these two measurements of inflation the wholesale commodity price index and the price of gold are the most reliable of all statistics in table  the wholesale commodity price index has increased  percent between  and  and the price of gold has increased  percent during the same period therefore one may conclude that the cost of cataloging has increased much more than the rate of inflation but not quite so much as the salary rate during the same period iv conclusion section  shows that library of congress cataloging copy has increased  percent in number of characters letters and numbers between samples taken from the pre  imprints and samples taken from the nuc
