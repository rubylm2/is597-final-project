volume xjii july  number  civil service in public libraries herbert goldhor introduction  ins is a report of the results of an investigation undertaken to evaluj ate the effects of the application of civil service on the practices used in the selection of employees for public libraries based on information collected by field visits early in  the method used was to compare the personnel policies and practices in the years   of six public libraries in cities of over two hundred thousand population three under civil service and three not under civil service these cities were selected with the help of three experts in librarianship as being above the average of the group from which they were drawn in the quality of their general internal administration los angeles oakland and st paul of the civil service group and detroit portland and providence of the non civil service group the criteria for evaluation were supplied by twenty principles of public personnel administration formulated in the light of the concept of a career service in government the area of employee selection alone was considered with special emphasis on the selection of junior librarians who occupy the basic class of the professional service and the most important class in the development of a career service the findings are presented according to six major topics under which the principles naturally group themselves this study attempts to measure the degree to which the standard practices of employee selection are used by the three civil service libraries as compared with their use by the three comparable noncivil service libraries it answers the question do civil service or non civil service libraries have better employees only to the extent that one is prepared to assume that the approved principles of public personnel administration secure better employees specifically the question to which this study was addressed may be stated thus in the light of experience has civil service helped or hindered public libraries in the use of the policies and practices of modern personnel administration that are considered essential to a career service two terms require definition a civil the essential portion of a dissertation submitted to the graduate library school of the university of chicago in september  in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of doctor of philosophy for a detailed statement of the problem and a description of the methodology used see herbert goldhor the selection of employees in large x
i the library quarterly service library is one that is required by law to fill vacancies on its staff by the appointment of persons selected through competitive examinations administered by a governmental agency independent of the library a career service is here taken to mean i that young people of the highest obtainable qualifications are induced to enter the service of an institution  that provision is made for assurance of tenure and good working conditions coupled with the fullest opportunities for promotion and  that there is no discrimination on grounds unrelated to merit organization for personnel administration the first important subdivision of the field of employee selection one that is relevant to the study of any area of personnel administration concerns the general plan for the organization of personnel administration in the institution desirable features of such organization are i there should be definite and adequate provision for personnel admnistration with a qualified individual in charge  an officially approved statement of the library personnel policy should be made available to employees  staff turnover should be neither very high nor very low provision for personnel administration the legal and ultimate responsibility for personnel administration in both the civil service and the non civil service libraries is lodged in the hands of the board of trustees or other governing authority usually the delegation to the chief librarian of the immediate responsibility for this function of administration is made explicitly in st paul and providence however it is made only implicitly in most cases too the chief librarian himself handles personnel administration in los angeles the assistant city librarian is in charge of branches and subject to the control of the city librarian of personnel administration for the whole system in the detroit public library the chief librarian is assisted by a full time personnel officer who has the rank of department head and is one of very few such officers in american libraries from each of the six institutions an estimate was secured of the amount of time and money devoted to personnel administration these estimates are based on incomplete data and justify only very general conclusions the amount of time spent on personnel administration in these libraries ranges from half time of one person to full time of three but the monetary equivalent is almost uniformly a little more than i per cent of the total library pay roll when the expenditures of the civil service commissions are added to these library expenditures it is found that more than twice as much money is being spent on personnel administration per employee in the civil service libraries as in the noncivil service libraries but it is probable that the machinery and routines of civil service account for the difference the civil service and non civil service libraries themselves however give approximately the same degree of attention to personnel administration similarly there is no consistent difference in the qualifications of the individuals in these libraries to whom personnel administration is assigned none of them had any formal training or special experience in this field before assuming their duties though all have had years of administrative experience in libraries no annual reports on personnel administracivil service and non civil service public libraries unpublished phd dissertation graduate library school university of chicago 
civil service in public libraries  tion were prepared in the last five years in any of the libraries investigated in none have any studies of personnel administration been undertaken all in all the single most important fact that stands out in this section is the existence of a full time personnel officer in the detroit public library a non civil service institution statement of personnel policythe necessity for a statement of the library personnel policies seems to have been more generally recognized by the noncivil service libraries in this study than by the civil service libraries the latter tend to rely on the rules of their respective civil service commissions such rules however are not always readily available they need to be translated furthermore so that library employees may grasp their significance and finally they cover only a part of the total area of personnel administration only in the oakland public library of the three civil service libraries has a recent statement of personnel policy appeared all three of the non civil service libraries on the other hand have issued such statements of policy since  of these portland staff manual is the best generally these documents are not distributed individually to new employees but are made available in every branch or department generally too there is no definite provision for future revision of the statement measured by what might be done in this direction public libraries can be said to have failed to give the matter the attention it deserves measured by actual practice it is clear that the practices of the non civil service libraries in the study are superior to those of the civil service institutions staff turnoverby staff turnover is meant the ratio of the number of separations occurring in a year to the total number of positions at the end of the year a high rate of turnover indicates that staff members are not being employed on a long term or career basis while a low turnover may indicate stagnancy though the absence of comparable data for all but a few other libraries makes it difficult to establish norms from the point of view of a career service in librarianship it is reasonable to consider i  per cent the optimum rate of turnover none of the six libraries in this study has formulated a policy on staff turnover and none has systematically collected or analyzed the basic data some of these figures for the years  i were compiled in the course of this study but are probably not strictly comparable or altogether reliable the turnover of nonprofessional employees is found to deviate widely from the suggested optimum of i  per cent in almost every case and it usually exceeds  per cent though in some cases it approaches zero for building service employees in general the civil service libraries have higher rates of turnoverfor nonprofessional employees than do the non civil service libraries among the professional staff the rate of turnover of junior librarians in all three non civil service institutions is close to the optimum this is true of only one of the civil service libraries los angeles the rate of turnover of the other professional employees furthermore is undesirably low in all cases though it is lower in the civil service libraries than in the non civil service libraries there is no evidence to indicate that these turnover rates are the results of a purposive policy but the actual figures indicate that the record of the non civil service libraries is more nearly library association of portland staff manual portand library association of portland ii mimeographed
igo the library quarterly in accord with approved practice than is that of the civil service libraries summaryin regard to the three main aspects of over all organization for personnel administration that have been discussed here it is seen that the practices of the non civil service libraries are more in accord with the principles of public personnel administration than are those of the civil service institutions the outstanding fact in the provision for personnel administration is the existence of a full time personnel officer in the detroit public library recently prepared statements of personnel policy are found in all three non civil service libraries finally the non civil service libraries have staff turnover rates that more nearly approach the optimum than do those of the civil service libraries position classification just as the nature of the organization for personnel administration in an institution is necessary to an understanding of the selection policies used so the existence of an adequate position classification plan is fundamental to the operation of those policies briefly such a plan groups together in classes those positions in a library that involve duties of comparable difficulty and complexity and responsibilities of comparable weight experience has shown that the three most important considerations concerning position classification plans are i the existence scope and basis of the plan  the arrangement of the plan and  the current administration of the plan existence of the planthe three civil service libraries in this study have position classification plans which in each case are a part of the official city wide plans of their respective civil service commissions all positions in these libraries are included in the plans save that of librarian in the st paul public library and part time positions in los angeles paying less than fifty dollars a month the los angeles plan was completely revised in i the position classification plan for the oakland public library dates back to i and that of st paul to  the los angeles and oakland plans were based on job description questionnaires filled out by the employees of the non civil service libraries portland and providence do not have position classification plans they both have pay plans for certain groups of employees which are necessarily based on a classification of positions but in neither case was the classification determined by a factual survey of the duties of those positions the detroit public library was included in the civil service commission i position classification plan for the whole city and job description questionnaires were secured for all positions in the library the library authorities however were allowed to specify the classes they wished and to establish salary rates for them independently of those used for other classes in the city service arrangement of the planone major test of the adequacy of a position classification plan relates to its arrangement ie i the grouping into classes of positions sufficiently comparable that the same qualifications can be demanded the same tests of selection used and the same salary scale applied to them all  the preparation of written specifications for each such class and  the arrangement of classes so as to differentiate between professional and clerical work and to provide a career service for each examination of the position classification plans of these libraries and the inter
civil service in public libraries ii views with library officers and employees indicate that the allocation of positions to the main classes is satisfactory in los angeles and in oakland in both st paul and detroit however the two basic classes of the professional service are not clearly differentiated in portland and providence the classification used is known to be based at least in part on considerations other than the duties and responsibilities involved class specifications are found in the plans of all three civil service libraries they are lacking in portland and providence and though they occur in the detroit plan they were prepared by the civil service commission but were never reviewed or approved by the library authorities and are known to include some factual errors one of the chief values of a position classification plan to a library other than as the basis of the salary schedule is to reveal the assignment of clerical duties to professionally qualified employees and vice versa in los angeles oakland and detroit the distinction between professional and clerical work is reasonably well observed in portland and especially in providence and st paul this distinction is less clear in none of these six libraries however is adequate provision made for a career service for clerical employees despite conclusive evidence that the major portion of the work done in libraries is clerical in nature current administration of the plana second major test of the adequacy of a position classification plan is found in the current administration of the plan a fundamental principle of position classification is that the classification plan does not limit the discretion of the administrator in changing the assignment of duties that constitute positions when such changes are made however they should result in a reclassification of the positions in question if the principle of equal pay for equal work is to be observed a classification plan should be kept up to date i by the reclassification of individual positions when their duties are changed and  by a periodic review of the whole classification plan in order to determine the correctness of the allocation of individual positions and of the grouping of positions into classes the civil service commissions of los angeles and oakland require that changes in duties be reported to them by the department heads about a halfdozen positions have been reclassified since i in los angeles but no individual positions have been reclassified in oakland or in st paul in the years ii a classification audit to determnine the correctness of the allocation of existing positions was made of clerical employees in los angeles in ii the oakland civil service board is conducting a permanent continuous reclassification survey of the city government department by department and the library turn will come soon and in st paul the classification plan was last reviewed in its entirety in i as far as the investigator was able to learn there is no serious abuse of out of grade assignments in los angeles or oakland but many library employees in st paul are given long continued assignments to duties in advance of those for which they were selected and are being paid current administration of position classification is nonsystematic in portan employee is said to be working out of grade when his duties have been so changed that they are no longer those of the class to which his position was originally allocated but more nearly resemble those of a class in a higher or lower grade if the two classes carry different salary schedules the result is that unequal pay is being given for the same work thus a junior librarian assigned the duties of a department head would be working out of grade
i the library quarterly land and entirely lacking in providence the detroit public library authorities however have secured approval of the budget bureau and common council of the reclassification of a dozen positions since  the best record of any library in this study at the same time a  survey by a special city wide classification committee recommended changes for about thirty library positions no indication was found of any serious abuse in the assignment of employees to work out of grade in portland or in detroit but it is probable that the principle of equal pay for equal work is not always observed in providence summarynot all public libraries under civil service have adequate position classification plans but typically when civil service is applied to a public library it involves the introduction of an official position classification plan as determined by a work analysis and covering all positions in the library on the other hand most non civil service public libraries have failed to develop adequate classification plans in part at least because of the natural tendency to ignore the plan under the stress of circumstances in general the civil service libraries in this study are superior to the non civil service libraries in their observance of the principles in this section qualifications the first important step in the actual selection of an employee is the determination of the qualifications considered necessary for the position to be filled four major factors were considered in this study residence disqualification on grounds unrelated to merit age and education and experience residencelocal residence has long been a qualification for government employment in this country and both civil service and non civil service libraries tend to fil their nonprofessional positions by the appointment of persons living in the immediate area the local residence qualification however constitutes a serious impediment to the development of a career service especially when it is applied to the filling of positions requiring professional or specialized training and experience the civil service residence requirement is one year in los angeles four years in oakland and six months in st paul this requirement was waived for all examinations for professional positions in the los angeles public library between i and  the oakland requirement was reduced to one year residence in the county for the i examination for junior librarian and to one year residence in the state for the  and i examinations the st paul residence requirement was waived only once for a library position in the years   in these cities as is almost always true of civil service jurisdictions the residence restriction is imposed by law though the commission is usually empowered to waive this qualification this means little since arrangements are not often made for candidates to take the complete examination in other cities the effective geographic range of selection available to these civil service libraries is thus definitely limited in all three non civil service libraries in the study professional employees are drawn from the nation of the professional employees who were appointed to these non civil service libraries between i and i and who returned the staff questionnaire used in this study s this staff questionnaire was answered by thirteen hundred of the two thousand employees in these six libraries from data supplied by the co operating institutions on such characteristics as age sex
civil service in public libraries over two thirds were living outside the city at the time of their appointment as compared to less than one third of the comparable employees in the three civil service libraries it was also found that the non civil service libraries drew on more colleges and more library schools for their professional employees in these years than did the civil service libraries the detroit public library in particular has an outstanding record of regularly appointing graduates from a dozen or more library schools scattered over the country the superiority of the non civil service libraries on this principle is to be expected and the available data confirm this expectation not all non civil service libraries choose their employees from the nation but the better ones do so while even superior civil service libraries are restricted to the city or state the residence qualification is probably the single most important defect in the application of civil service to libraries disqualification on grounds unrelated to meritthe disqualification of individuals on grounds unrelated to merit is considered in relation to sex marital status race religion and politics civil service libraries are usually forbidden by law to consider those characteristics of candidates that are not related to their actual qualifications though the wide discretion allowed the appointing officer can be used to circumvent this regulation the authorities of the non civil service libraries not only have the same administrative discretion but are free to formulate selection policies that make such nonoccupational characteristics qualifying or disqualifying factors in appointment this very freedom of the non civil service libraries means that their stand on the matter is likely to reflect the mores of the community and the personal opinions of the trustees and chief librarians there is no policy forbidding the appointment of men to the professional staff of any of these six libraries nor is there a stated preference for women los angeles portland and providence have relatively few male librarians st paul and detroit on the contrary have an unusually large number of them on the average in january i the three civil service libraries had six male librarians  per cent of the total professional staff and the three non civil service libraries seven male librarians  per cent of the total professional staff in general it is probable that young men graduating from library school are more likely to be able to secure positions as junior librarians in those civil service libraries investigated in this study than in the non civil service libraries whether married women should be given employment as professional librarians is subject to more difference of opinion than any of the other grounds of discrimination considered here for the purposes of this study the disqualification of individuals because of their marital status is considered undesirable the three civil service libraries have no official regulation or unofficial policy against appointing married women or against continuing their appointment after marriage although all three non civil service libraries discriminate against married women to a greater or less degree they have probably acted in good faith influenced no doubt by tradition and permarital status and previous residence it was found that the employees answering the questionnaire are representative of the total group  in order to give each library a weight of one so that a large institution will not determine the average of its group the percentages shown here are averages of the percentages of the various libraries and not total averages of the original raw data
i the library quarterly haps by a few unfortunate experiences data on the number of married women in the six libraries clearly reflect these policies in january   per cent of the women on the professional staffs of the civil service libraries were married as contrasted with only i  per cent of the women in the non civil service libraries the appointment of negroes unquestionably raises delicate problems for the administrator though none of the six libraries has any regulation or even any unofficial ruling against the employment of negroes in any capacity there is reason to believe that this policy of nondiscrimination has not been observed in every instance in january i there was an average of twenty three negro employees in the three civil service libraries  per cent of the total staff as compared with an average of eight negro employees in the three non civil service libraries  per cent of the total staff the main difference however occurred in the employment of negroes as building service workers the civil service process makes it difficult to determine whether discrimination against negroes is being practiced in any case the civil service libraries approximate the principle in question more closely than do the non civil ser vice libraries in all six libraries the official policy is to give no consideration to the religious affiliation of applicants in the selection of employees estimates of the number of jewish and catholic employees were secured for four libraries but the absence of complete data makes it impossible to draw any conclusions in portland however where the library application blank asks for religious affiliation there were no jews on the staff in january  the american library association personnel division and the library schools of denver illinois wisconsin and columbia of those whose reports were seen find it advisable furthermore to include information on religious affiliation in their statements on students and candidates for appointment in the civil service and non civil service libraries alike the political affiliation ie whether republican or democrat plays no part in the selection process on the whole libraries are relatively free from political interference though that is not to say that political pressure has been entirely lacking in recent years politics has at some time influenced the choice of certified eligibles or the filling of minor positions not under civil service in two of the three civil service libraries here studied in general however the civil service libraries in this study appear to have a higher rating than the non civil service libraries with respect to the principle that individual candidates should not be disqualified because of personal nonoccupational characteristics unrelated to merit ageby definition a career service demands the recruitment of employees in the entering grades at a relatively early age so that they may be able to spend their best and most active years in the profession none of the civil service libraries in this study has a formal maximum age qualification for examinations for junior librarian in portland of the non civil service libraries there is no maximum age limit in providence applicants over forty will not be considered and in detroit the official qualifying age limit is set at thirty five the authorities in all six libraries prefer to appoint junior librarians who are under thirty or thirtyfive years of age from the staff questionnaires used in this study it is possible to calculate the average age of the present junior librarians in each institution who were ap
civil service in public libraries i pointed to that grade between  and  for the three civil service libraries the average age of these junior librarians at the time of their appointment was thirty for the three non civil service libraries it was twenty six it appears therefore that herbert recommendation of a maximum qualifying age limit of thirty is not unreasonable there may be some question as to the desirability of age limits for appointments to higher positions but if a career service is to be established in a library there should be a group of young professionals at the entering level both to secure their vitality for the service of the institution and to provide a reservoir for desirable promotional appointments on this point the policy and practice of these civil service and non civil service libraries are generally satisfactory and not greatly different the advantage however is in favor of the non civil service institutions education and experienceanother cornerstone of a career service consists of high educational and low experiential requirements for the entering class of the professional service such requirements secure junior librarians with a wide cultural background and strong technical training but without extensive practical experience none of the civil service commissions in this study requires previous experience as a prerequisite for appointment as a junior librarian though such experience can usually be substituted for part of the required education in los angeles and oakland college and library school graduation are among the formal qualifications for candidates for the position of junior librarian though the commission in the latter city is without legal power to enforce these qualifications in st paul the requirements for the basic class of the professional service are one year of college and one year of experience as a library clerk of the non civil service libraries detroit and portland both have an official requirement that candidates for appointment as junior librarian must be college and library school graduates in neither library is previous experience required in providence the official minimum requirements for appointment to the basic class of the professional service are highschool graduation and completion of the six month training class from the staff questionnaires returned by the present junior librarians who have been appointed between i and i it was found that about go per cent of them in both the civil service and the non civil service libraries are college graduates and about o per cent are library school graduates but while  per cent of the junior librarians in the three non civil service libraries were without previous professional experience only  per cent of the same dass of employees in the civil service libraries were without experience in other words junior librarians in the non civil service libraries have about as high educational qualifications as those in the civil service institutions but tend less often to have had previous experience the desirability of high educational qualifications is being questioned by some civil service administrators on the ground that such requirements are more or less arbitrary and that a valid exami clara w herbert personnel administration in public libraries chicago american library association  p   this figure of  per cent for the civil service libraries is the average of the data for los angeles and oakland st paul is omitted because the strict local residence requirement and the fact that most junior librarians have had experience in the clerical grades of the same library make the situation noncomparable
i the library quarterly nation will select the most competent candidates regardless of their formal education this argument is theoretically sound but written examinations have not yet been brought to such a high point of validity the high educational requirements furthermore are formulated with an eye to future promotion and finally the regularity with which untrained candidates fail to pass examinations for professional positions makes it advisable to save their time and that of the examing agency by eliminating them in advance on the other hand the desirability of experience has probably been overemphasized in librarianship to require experience in other institutions for appointment to advanced positions results in a system of promotion by moving rather than one of promotion from within in service training and time will compensate for the lack of experience but not for the educational training which makes college and library school graduates natural timber for promotion summaryon three of the four qualifications discussed in this section the policies and practices of the non civil service libraries are more nearly in accord with the principles of public personnel administration than are those of the civil service libraries in regard to residence age and education and experience the non civil service libraries enjoy a superior rating only with respect to the principle that candidates should not be disqualified on grounds unrelated to merit do the civil service libraries have the higher rating the evidence indicates that the qualifications for employment in civil service libraries are likely to be determined by limitations in statutes and civil service rules while the more flexible procedures of the non civil service libraries tend to reflect earlier the advancing standards of the profession recruitment and application one of the salient characteristics of modern public personnel administration is the replacement of the attitude let the man seek the job by a positive program of recruitment in this section attention is directed first to the public announcement of vacancies since the number of qualified candidates is likely to be in proportion to the number who are aware of the vacancy second to the positive measures of recruitment used since the efforts to publicize the vacancy in large measure determine the number and quality of candidates and third to the use of the application blank since it serves as a crude sieve in eliminating grossly unqualified candidates public announcement of vacancies according to the usual civil service practice announcements of all pending examinations for library positions are made by the three civil service commissions in this study such announcements appear about four to six weeks before the date of the examination and closely resemble the traditional civil service examination notice in style and form on the other hand no public announcement of a vacancy in any position has been made by any of the three non civil service libraries this is the usual practice of noncivil service institutions the administrators of the non civil service libraries feel that they already have access to the best sources of supply and that public announcement of vacancies would cause more trouble than it is worth in weeding out unqualified applicants but public administration experts uniformly advocate the opposite policy i to recruit candidates from a wide field thereby ncreasing the chances of securing high quality personnel  to minimize the covert influence of discrimination against minority groups and 
civil service in public libraries  to force employing authorities to rationalize the selection process the public announcement of vacancies is a cornerstone of civil service practice and the failure of the non civil service libraries to observe this principle is not likely to receive public approbation it should be pointed out however that the residence qualification normally found under civil service imposes a very definite limitation on the beneficial results of public announcement of examinations furthermore the announcements of examinations for library positions issued by the civil service commissions in this study have not been especially well prepared for selling the job to the bestqualified candidates and inducing them to apply there is large scope for improvement in this connection but the practice of the civil service libraries is more in accord with the general principle of the public announcement of vacancies than is that of the non civil service libraries positive measures of recruitmentmodem public personnel administration has learned that the employees of an organization can be no better qualified than the group from which they are chosen that it is not enough to rely on the applications filed solely on the initiative of the candidates and that a positive program is necessary to induce the best qualified persons available to apply for a given vacancy clear and direct as this obligation is for the non civil service libraries it is no less incumbent on those under civil service in the three civil service cities in this study recruitment for examinations for library positions has been the responsibility primarily of the civil service commissions with only incidental and informal participation by the library the authorities of all three civil service libraries expressed their satisfaction with the recruitment work that has been done by their respective commissions though the latter have relied for the most part only on the more or less wide distribution of the mimeographed or printed announcement of the examination this is the traditional recruitment device of civil service on the other hand no examination conducted by these civil service commissions in the last five years was announced in any professional library periodical nor have most of the examinations for the entering professional grade been timed for the convenience of library school students so that registers could be established and appointments made by the end of the academic year the non civil service libraries in this study follow recruiting methods common to non civil service institutions generally that is to say they depend on two mair sources for the names of possible candi dates the applications voluntarily filed with them by individual candidates and the recommendations of two or three library schools the detroit public library however draws regularly on the top dozen library schools of the country and alone of these three libraries occasionally seeks the help of the american library association personnel division the fact that candidates who offer themselves to non civil service libraries apply on their own initiative renders the use of unsolicited applications of dubious value and the reliance on the recommendations of the library school directors rests on the large assumption that they are competent to judge which of their students are fitted for a particular library position one of the items on the staff questionnaire used in this study secured information on the employee source of information concerning the examination or vacancy by which he entered the library service analysis of the three hundred
i the library quarterly replies received from employees appointed in  i revealed i that the number of non civil service employees applying without knowledge of a vacancy was twice that of the civil service employees so applying  that only four persons secured ther positions through the american library association personnel division  that three fifths of the nonprofessional employees applied on their own initiative or heard of the vacancy through friends  that only about onefourth of the employees of the civil service libraries cited the examination announcement as the source of their information and  that about  per cent of the professional employees heard of the vacancy through their library school though the library schools are therefore the single most important source of candidates experience indicates that no one method of recruitment will serve to supply the necessary applicants none of these six institutions has recognized its responsibility for conducting a campaign of recruitment for the profession in general the record of both types of libraries in regard to recruitment is far from bright the non civil service libraries have failed to develop a positive program of recruitment though as indicated above they have secured professional employees at least as well qualified as those found in the civil service libraries the civil service commissions on the other hand are doing no more than a reasonably adequate job compared to what they might do the balance is too close to assign credit to either type of library for the utilization of superior methods of recruiting library employees use of the application blankafter the recruitment campaign the next step in the selection program should be a review of the applications the information supplied by the candidate on his aplication should be checked against the formal qualifications established as minimum requirements and unqualified candidates should be rejected this saves the time of both the candidate and the personnel agency and insures the observance of the qualifications that have been established in the three civil service libraries the official application blank is that used by the civil service commission usually such applications will be accepted only within the time period specified by the announcement of the examination in all three cities applications are reviewed by the civil service commissions for some of the published requirements eg residence and citizenship but it is questionable whether they are reviewed for other qualifications to as great an extent as is desirable thus the los angeles commission tends not to insist on absolute minimums and the oakland commission is unable by law to do so in all cases though both reject the applications of grossly unqualified candidates similarly these two commissions make no systematic attempt to verify the information supplied by applicants in the three non civil service libraries applications can be filed at any time for any position typically there is a rather full form for candidates for professional positions but for nonprofessional positions there is either no application form at all or only a brief identification slip in portland and detroit applications are briefly examined upon receipt to determine the candidate general eligibility but in providence this review tends to come only when a specific vacancy leads to a survey of the applications on hand at that point all three of these libraries verify the information supplied by the candidate for a professional position by

civil service in public libraries  further differentiation on this ground unnecessary in the selection of general assistants the wide variations in academic grades in civil service examination scores and in the actual performance of individuals are enough to raise questions as to the correctness of this assumption in addition various studies in librarianship and other fields tend to cast doubt on its accuracy yet the use of written examinations in the selection of employees is rarely found in non civil service libraries in comparison with the techniques used in the non civil service libraries in this study the civil service examinations are much further advanced toward achieving the goal of objective reliable and valid measures of the knowledge possessed by candidates they have at least laid the basis on which future research can be built such a foundation is lacking in the selection work of the noncivil service libraries in examinations of knowledge the practices of the civil service libraries in this study are more nearly in accord with the principles of public personnel administration than are those of the non civil service libraries evaluation of personalitythe knowledge possessed by candidates is a measurable and relatively discrete characteristic so also is the state of their health and to a lesser extent the degree of general abstract intelligence that they possess the other personal traits of the candidates for appointment are here considered together under the general heading of personality only a limited amount of work has been done to develop valid and reliable measures in this field and typically the methods used by the civil service and non civil service libraries are made to apply to all aspects of personality in the three civil service cities an oral interview lasting about fifteen minutes forms part of all examinations for professional library positions and constitutes the main method for the evaluation of personality in los angeles and st paul the procedures that have been developed are reasonably satisfactory and relatively effective in both cities only those traits are rated which are thought necessary for successful performance of the duties of the position in question and are observable in an interview such traits include physical appearance voice and speech judgment ability to present ideas etc a panel of three judges is used including some librarians though not of the staff of the local public library the ratings of the judges are recorded on a graphic rating scale in los angeles and on a probst personality report in st paul in oakland however the oral interview is usually conducted solely by the chief examiner of the civil service board nine tenths of the interview is an oral examination of knowledge and one tenth a rating on apparent adaptabilityin effect the examiner individual opinion of unspecified aspects of the personality of the candidate furthermore the oakland civil service board makes a deliberate effort to minimize the influence of the oral interview by limiting the scores for all but the most obviously unqualified candidates to the range between seventy and eighty five this policy that a candidate should not fail the examination because of a low mark on the interview part alone is followed to a lesser extent in los angeles it is explained in both cases by the disrepute into which earlier oral interviews of these commissions had fallen and by the knowledge that personality ratings are highly unreliable in the non civil service libraries the standard device for the evaluation of a candidate personality is a personal interview lasting usually for thirty min
 the library quarterly utes normally only those candidates are interviewed who apply in person or who have been selected for serious consideration for appointment though some professional employees have been appointed in portland and detroit without interviews in none of these non civil service libraries is there any formal statement of the specific personality traits desired save that in portland the trait most valued is extroversion in each of these libraries a candidate is usually interviewed separately by at least two officers but nothing is done to assure that both interviewers will look for the same qualities no rating scales or report blanks are used the only result of the rating process is a subjective over all impression expressed in a few words on the candidate application in addition to these personal interviews with the candidate the non civil service libraries regularly secure the con fidential reports of the library schools and are guided by them to a large extent the adequacy of the ratings issued by the library schools can be questioned as to their internal reliability not to speak of the comparabillty of the reports received from the different schools and as to their validity the one study in this field does not induce confidence in the methods used by library schools in evaluating the personality of their students probably the best practical test of personality is the individual performance on the job during the probationary period the problem however is to predict his behavior on the job to do this both the civil service and the non civil service libraries are relying essentially on a direct face to face conversation between the selecting authority and the candidate such a personal interview is a valuable tool but one with limited possibilities three main problems are involved i defining the traits desired  concentrating attention on those specific traits in the candidate and  securing reliable ratings to solve these problems the civil service commissions rely more on consciously objective procedures and less on intuitive response in their attempts to measure personality the results are sometimes faulty and often crude but no better way has yet been found that will bear analysis thus the st paul civil service board which has brought its procedures to a high point of development has statistical evidence that indicates a reasonable degree of success in isolating personality traits and securing reliable ratings of them though many pencil and paper tests of personality are available and widely used neither type of personnel administration has chosen to experiment with them to the frequent comment that civil service fails to test for personality must be added the fact that non civil service libraries also fail to test adequately for personality the non civil service libraries in this study are prepared to reject candidates because of unsatisfactory personality ratings but there is no assurance that as clarence sherman suggests personality is not synonymous with what the selecting officer happens to like or dislike in people though the civil service libraries deliberately minimize the influence of the scores for interviews in two cases out of three those scores are reached through a conscious striving after objectivity between these two positions there is little to choose save that the civil service procedures alone offer the necessary foundation for further progress intelligence and special aptitude tests lo m a milczewski personality rating of library school students unpublished master thesis library school university of illinois i
civil service in public libraries  in selecting an employee for a specific vacancy it is natural to think of the particular qualifications needed for that position but if a career service is to be developed the persons given original entrance appointments should be selected with a view to their suitability for promotion to advanced positions it is for this reason that junior librarians should be required to have had extensive education for the same reason it is desirable that in the selection process the general intelligence of the candidates and their special aptitude for library work should be considered even beyond the point where those qualities might be necessary for the immediate vacancy none of the three civil service commissions in this study makes any attempt to test for special aptitude in candidates for library positions and none uses any type of standardized intelligence test a fact due at least in part to their fear of public reaction to what might seem like irrelevant questions however the los angeles civil service commission in some of its examinations for library positions has attempted to measure general intelligence through questions constructed around library problems and stated in library terminology on such matters as word usage ability to analyze situations and reasoning ability and the scores on the  st paul page examination which in view of the elementary nature of the duties of the position was an examination of general knowledge are found to have a correlation of  with the known intelligence quotients of the candidates as determined by various standard tests administered no more than five years earlier none of the three non civil service libraries attempts to isolate and measure either special aptitude or general intelligence in the candidates considered for appointment though they presumably have greater freedom than the civil service libraries to experiment in this direction other organizations particularly the bureau of public personnel administration have reported the scores of library employees on intelligence tests an accumulation of large numbers of such records is needed to provide norms and critical scores for the guidance of individual libraries some work in the determination of special aptitude has been done by library schools in connection with the selection of students but practically nothing has been reported in regard to the selection of library employees despite the solid amount of research that has been accomplished in the general field of aptitude testing neither the civil service nor the noncivil service libraries considered in this investigation are taking any steps to measure aptitude or general abstract intelligence save for a few nonsystematic attempts by the civil service commissions to test for intelligence neither type of library has demonstrated a superior record in this regard medical examinationexamination by a physician before original entrance appointment is clearly desirable for at least three reasons i to secure employees who are in good health and free from disease or disqualifying physical defects  to protect the retirement plan by eliminating potential disability cases and  to prevent financial loss to the library under workmen compensation laws as a result of employee injuries in all three civil service cities candidates for library positions are given a medical examination by the civil service commission doctor usually after they have passed the written test and are about to be considered for appointment in los angeles and st paul this exami
 the library quarterly nation is free in oakland the candidate pays a fee of one dollar the library authorities in the three cities feel that the medical examination is reasonably adequate and report that some candidates for library employment have been rejected on this examination in recent years none of the non civil service libraries in this study has hitherto required a medical examination of candidates for any position though their application blanks contain questions regarding the candidate health and physical defects late in ii however a series of compensation cases led the detroit public library to institute a medical examination for building service employees this will be given by a doctor chosen by the library and will be without cost to the candidate the chief purpose of a medical examination is to secure healthy employees presumably the success of this policy should be found in the sick leave record of the institution but when data on this point were secured it was found that on the average the employees of the civil service libraries were absent six and onehalf days in ii because of illness while the employees of the non civil service libraries were absent less than four days on the average these data however are not altogether comparable and the records of the institutions in the two groups overlap despite the failure of the data on sick leave to justify the use of a medical examination the desirability of such an examination is apparent since the principle relates to the use of a medical examination and not to the amount of time lost through illness the practices of the civil service libraries more nearly conform to the principle in question than do those of the non civil service libraries summarythe civil service libraries in this study use approved practices in examinations of knowledge and medical examinations to a greater degree than do the non civil service libraries the same rating is made of the procedures used by the civil service libraries in the evaluation of personality but it applies more to the potential than to the actual results of their present policies neither type of personnel administration has taken any important steps to test for intelligence or special aptitude one of the main advantages of civil service is the use of objective examinations in the selection of employees though the best civil service examination cannot compensate for the elimination of superior applicants because of a residence requirement on the other hand the reliance of the selecting officers of the non civil service libraries on unsupported individual judgments offers no assurance that the best applicant will be selected in general as far as examinations are concerned the practices of the civil service libraries in this study are judged to be more nearly in accord with the principles of modern public personnel administration than are those of the non civil service libraries appointment procedures the selection process is not completed with the examination of applicants appointment procedures are integral parts of the selection process and their proper functioning is important in a career service three such procedures concern i temporary appointments  the use of the probationary period and  the maintenance of eligible lists with the names of qualified candidates for positions to which appointments are likely to be made frequently temporary appointmentsthe appointment of persons whose services will

 the library quarterly year in oakland orientation of new employees is left to the library authorities and consists for the most part of job instruction only periodic service rating reports are filed for all new employees by regulation of the library in los angeles and of the civil service commissions in oakland and st paul probationary appointments in the los angeles public library are automatically converted into permanent appointments without positive action by either library or civil service authorities in oakland the civil service board reminds the library administration of the expiration of probationary appointments for employees who have been given unsatisfactory service ratings no further action is required or taken in st paul however the librarian must specifically request the permanent appointment of every probationer if no such request is made the civil service bureau will inform the employee that he is dismissed of the non civil service libraries portland observes no probationary period in providence it is one year for professional employees the official probationary period in detroit is one year also but this official period has been largely ignored orientation of new employees especially of nonprofessional workers is not well developed in these libraries in i both detroit and portland instituted the fist of an annual series of talks and planned work experiences and in providence new professional employees are required to take the traiming class course in library management evaluation of the work of new employees is achieved primarily through informal oral or written reports from the employee supervisor supplemented by service ratings made annually or less often in providence and detroit in detroit no positive action is needed to convert a probationary appointment into a permanent appointment in providence however the librarian usually informs the employee of the successful completion of his probation the number of employees discharged as unsatisfactory during their probationary period is uniformly low in all six institutions on the average about five probationers almost all nonprofessionals were released in the period i i by each library this is less than  per cent of the total number of appointments made in these years as a check on the effectiveness of the probationary period one item on the staff questionnaire asked the employee to indicate the length of time he had served on probation of those appointed since   per cent in the civil service libraries knew the correct length of their probationary period as opposed to  per cent of those in the non civil service libraries both types of libraries need to increase the effectiveness with which the probationary period is used as a step in the selection process but the civil service libraries here studied receive a rating on this principle that is definitely though only slightly higher than that of the non civil service libraries the latter have developed better induction programs for their professional personnel but portland has no stated probationary period and detroit has largely ignored its official period the three civil service libraries tend to use formal methods of evaluating the work of probationers and their employees are more often aware of the length of the period they served on probation than are the employees of the non civil service libraries eligible listsup to this point the selection process has been considered in terms of the unit position to be filled obviously it would be inefficient to re
civil service in public libraries  peat the whole process for each individual vacancy especially for classes of positions to which appointments are likely to be made frequently for such classes of positions lists of the best qualified candidates as determined by the regular selection process should be prepared in anticipation of vacancies and should be revised at least annually if they are to retain their value for current use civil service eligible lists are established originally for two years in los angeles and oakland and for one year in st paul in each case they may be renewed once for the same periods but no registers for library positions have been renewed in recent years in los angeles or oakland new registers in these cities are usually not established until a vacancy exists for which no eligibles are available the oakland civil service board however takes special pains to watch the rate of appointments from existing lists and to have new registers available when needed eligible lists in these cities are generally ready by six weeks after the examination all candidates on these registers are informed of their rank and score and in oakland the complete list is posted publicly none of the non civil service libraries has formal lists of qualified candidates to which the library authorities necessarily turn first when a vacancy occurs most of their new appointments however are made in the summer and fall and the file of applications received by these libraries constitutes a kind of informal eligible list in all three institutions the selection process starts with a review of these applications if no satisfactory candidates are found here recourse is usually had to the library schools all the nonprofessional and about one third of the professional appointments in these non civil service libraries are made from the candidates who have filed applications with the institution on their own initiative the procedures of the non civil service libraries allow them to consider for each vacancy any new candidates who make themselves available the only parallel to this under civil service is the continuously open examination system by which candidates may apply at any time be examined and be given a rating and a place on the register of the three civil service cities in this study this plan is found only in oakland where it was introduced in  for library pages but the typical civil service procedures are in general quite inflexible thus two years is too long for an eligible list to be used advantageously from the incomplete data available it appears that only about half the candidates who obtained a place on the registers for positions in these civil service libraries in the years i i were appointed many of the others probably waived certification or were not available on the other hand the noncivil service libraries rarely reveal the rating of candidates for appointment in comparison with other applicants the appointing officers in these civil service libraries have a choice of the top three names the authorities of the non civil service libraries tend to make their final choice from no more than five candidates the procedures of the non civil service libraries are clearly less systematic than are those of the civil service libraries but at the same time they are more flexible the civil service registers are used for a longer period than is considered desirable but the non civil service libraries sometimes draw on applications that are even older the civil service registers however are given much more public access than are the equiivalent records of the non civil service libraries further
 the library quarterly more it is probable that the non civil service libraries go through the complete selection process more often than do the civil service libraries for a given number of vacancies the practices of the civil service libraries are then somewhat more in accord with the principles of good personnel administration than are those of the non civil service libraries sumnaryappointment procedures must be considered in order to secure a full understanding of the selection process no particular abuse of temporary appointments is found in either type of library which speaks well for the civil service institutions in view of the traditional misuse of this device under civil service the potential uses of the probationary period have not been fully explored by either the civil service or the non civil service libraries though the former are probably more active in this connection than the latter similarly in regard to eligible lists the civil service libraries are utilizing this tool to a greater extent than the non civil service libraries but with no high degree of skill or effectiveness in short the civil service libraries have a record in regard to these appointment procedures that is definitely though only slightly more in accord with the statement of the principles than is that of the non civil service libraries conclusions this study does not attempt to answer completely or finally the question of whether it is or is not desirable to extend civil service to public libraries from the evidence that has been presented however some major conclusions may be drawn that are relevant to that question and to the development of a career service in librarianship under either type of personnel administration these conclusions are presented in three main sections i a summary of the comparison between the civil service and the noncivil service public libraries included in this investigation  the general characteristics of personnel practices in the civil service and the non civil service libraries and  recommendations for the further development of a career service in librarianship summary of the comparison between civil service and non civil service public librariesthe purpose of this investigation was to ascertain whether the application of civil service procedures to public libraries results in programs of employee selection that are more adequate or less adequate than those found in noncivil service libraries it did not attempt to determine whether civil service or non civil service libraries have the better employees nor can it pretend to offer any categorical answer to the question of the application of civil service to libraries stated in other words the question to which this study was addressed is this do the employee selection practices of civil service libraries or of non civil service libraries more nearly resemble those considered necessary for a career service the criteria used in this evaluation are twenty principles of public personnel administration designed to embody the concept of a career service and presumably applicable to all types of governmental agencies since all of the principles are not of equal importance it will be more realistic to summarize the findings according to the six major aspects of employee selection by which the twenty principles were grouped for purposes of discussion the civil service libraries conform more closely to the principles with respect to position classification examinations and appointment procedures the non civil service libraries with
civil service in public libraries  respect to organization for personnel administration and the qualifications for employment neither type of library has used approved practices to any great degree with respect to recruitment and application since the difference with respect to some of these principles is slight the final result of the investigation may be stated as follows no substantial superiority has been revealed either by these civil service over these non civil service libraries or vice versa in the use of approved practices of employee selection the available evidence indicates that on the whole the three civil service libraries are using the approved principles of employee selection to as great an extent as are the three non civil service libraries in this study general characteristics of personnel practices in the civil service and non civil service public librariesthe bare answer to the specific question at the heart of this study will be better understood by a brief analysis of the essential characteristics of the two types of personnel administration three major and differentiating characteristics of the employeeselection practices of the civil service libraries in this study are i the systematic and comprehensive nature of their personnel regulations accompanied by some rigidity in operation  the tendency of the civil service commission to act only as an external agency for the selection of employees rather than as a complete central personnel agency and  the general insistence on the residence requirement or the failure to allow examinations to be taken in other cities with all its effects in reducing the value of otherwise desirable recruitment and examination practices similarly three outstanding characteristics of the personnel practices of the non civil service libraries may be emphasized i the flexibility of their personnel regulations arising in part from the fact that they are often informal and uncodified  the resemblance they bear to the employee selection practices of educational institutions especially colleges and universities and  their failure to develop the technical aspects of personnel administration or to utilize the results of personnel research in practice the extension of civil service to libraries has failed to produce the ideal results that contemporary discussions of civil service might lead one to expect the chief defects found in the application of civil service selection procedures to libraries are i the residence qualification  failure of the commission to understand the library problems and  failure of the commission to do competent work but the civil service libraries themselves must share the responsibility for the failure to develop a career service in librarianship adoption of civil service insures that government employment shall be a lifework but not necessarily a career service it does not remove the necessity for internal personnel administration but only alters some of the forms it will take on the other hand the salient fact about the non civil service libraries in this study is that on the whole they have failed to utilize their freedom from civil service to develop a superior program of personnel administration they are not making the advances in personnel administration that it is reasonable to expect them to have made and that are likely to be demanded of them as the price of their continued exemption from civil service by and large they are utilizing practices which are typical and traditional in public library administration these methods are being applied
 the library quarterly more effectively but their basic design has not been improved nor are they applying the newer knowledge of personnel management the administrators of all three non civil service libraries in this study feel that they are giving about as much attention to personnel administration as might reasonably be expected the bases ot modern personnel administration are reasonably clear and well known good personnel administration does not require a formal civil service system but it does require procedures that can be shown by objective and statistical analysis to be valid and reliable when the practices reported for these libraries are evaluated by principles necessary for a career service it becomes clear that both the civil service and non civil service libraries need to give increased attention to personnel administration the comparative ratings of the two types of libraries made in this study should not be permitted to disguise the fact that neither type of library has succeeded in developing a wholly satisfactory career service in librarianship recommendations for the further development of a career service in librarianship before great weight can be attached to the findings of this study they must be confirmed or corrected by other investigations the conclusions of this study are valid only within the limitations of the data that were collected and the assumptions that were made if it is assumed however that the findings of this study are substantially correct the evidence that has been presented suggests several recommendations for the further development of a career service in librarianship with respect to internal administration there are four main points to which attention should be directed the numerous specific reforms that might thereupon be undertaken are easily deduced from the implications of the concept of a career service i the immediate responsibility for personnel administration should be definitely assigned to a qualified individual  a formal and detailed statement of the library personnel policies should be prepared and distributed  adequate personnel records should be installed and a program of factual study begun  personnel policies for the nonprofessional staff should be reviewed and revised so that a career service may be provided for such employees as well as for the professional staff a career service in librarianship can also be fostered in a number of ways that involve primarily agencies outside the library for example closer co ordination between civil service and state certification of librarians would help to establish the qualifications of library personnel increased use of joint examinations co operatively developed by various civll service commissions may result in a co ordinated system for the selection of library employees the american library association and some of the state library associations have shown that a great deal of help can be rendered by these bodies in the improvement of library personnel administration and the contributions that general personnel research can make to librarianship have not yet been tapped finally it will not be amiss to point out that one way by which librarians can further develop a career service for themselves is by helping to raise the standards of personnel administration in the public service generally the proper selection and direction of well qualified employees is becoming an increasingly important
civil service in public libraries  phase of public administration all the public service professions are affected and all are vitally interested in the development of a career service in government employment the non civil service libraries should be interested in the matter also for the issue is not necessarily one of civil service versus non civil service under either type of personnel administration a career service is possible the results of this study indicate that superior civil service libraries are using the approved principles of personnel administration in the selection of employees to as great an extent as are superior non civil service libraries it has been found that the main disadvantage of civil service is the residence requirement or what amounts to the same thingthe failure to hold the complete examination in other cities the main advantage of civil service lies in the use of objective examination procedures the absence of such examination procedures is the principal defect of the non civil service libraries while their chief advantage is found in the flexibility of their regulations in short more attention to personnel administration is needed in both types of institutions if a career service in librarianship is to be developed
