trends and developments in higher education carter davidson rf hie small liberal arts college dommated the scene of american high er education for the first two centuries from the founding of harvard in  until the civil war in the  there was a grand total of  students in a hundred small colleges none of them with more than  students for twenty years before the civil war the percentage of young men of college age who were actually attending college declined noticeably and the war itself wrote finis to the story of many an institution the war ended the nation realized it had come of age and looked about for new forms to embody its new aspirations great britain had lost favor because of her partisanship during the conflict and the new european power germany conqueror of austria and led by the impressive bismarck was beginning to dominate the scene as a result it was to the german universities of berlin munich leipzig bonn freiburg heidelberg marburg jena gbttingen or erlangen rather than to the british oxford or cambridge that america turned for her models in the german universities the stress was upon research scholarship and professional preparation for law or medicine or theology rather than upon the old liberal arts as a result america turned to the university pattern for her new higher education in  cornell university under andrew d white and partly financed by the federal government through the land grant college act of senator mornill opened with colleges of engineering agriculture and mechanic arts in  charles w eliot became president of harvard and during his forty year term gave this oldest college its present university structure in  vanderbilt university opened its doors in nashville with schools of law medicine and engineering as well as liberal arts the johns hopkins university begun in  under president daniel coit gilman at first had no undergraduate college at all but admitted only to the professional and graduate schools of a german type in  clark university opened under president g stanley hall as a graduate school of psychology the year  saw the west move into the field with stanford university led by an experimental ichthyologist david starr jordan and with sufficient money to employ the greatest scholars of the day in this respect its main rival was the university of chicago re established with the rockefeller wealth and presided over by a great scholar of hebrew william rainey harper while these new universities were coming into being many of the older eastern colleges such as yale and columbia were also undergoing a gradual conversion to the university idea and form by the beginning of the twentieth century the university was dominant in the american picture the last fifty years have seen tremendous growth in the size of the student bodies from slightly over two hundred thousand to over two million students of whom more than half are in our  universities and less than a quarter in  separate liberal arts colleges many 
 the library quarterly of the largest universities are state institutions but the largest of all is privately controlled and financed today the private liberal arts college has managed to hold its place by emphasizing the social and intellectual values of the intimate relations in a smaller student body in curriculum and general educational philosophy however the universities still dominate the scene and what are the major emphases which are now given in our american higher education i should like to develop them under four main headings culture character competence and citizenship the alliteration may help to tie them together the university of today is what it has been for seven centuries a treasure house of culture it is living proof that we are not the first who have trod this planet and that each age race nation and outstanding individual has left some gift which we of today can make part of our own heritage as albert einstein has told us all things exist in a fourth dimension of time it is a function of education to help us to exist in time in the riches of the past the problems of the present and the hopes of the future we stand knee deep in the river of human experience knowing that much has flowed past before we came that it continues on throughout our lives and probably will flow on in the future it is this consciousness of our heritage from the past which sets man apart from the other members of the animal kingdom in many ways the bees and the ants may be our social superiors but in this respect they have not developed because this heritage is what glorifies the human being it is well that we call its study the humanities  a university operates upon at least three levels instruction research and services in the area of the humanities the purpose of instruction is to enable the student to enter into his cultural inheritance this can be achieved by the student partly through absorption partly through creation he can absorb the experience of history the wisdom of philosophy and the vicarious emotions and adventures of literature through reading through the techniques of teaching students can be trained to read rapidly accurately and with critical appreciation during the early stages the books can be prescribed or recommended by the faculty so that the best of our cultural heritage will be known but as the student gains maturity he should be given more and more freedom of choice at times i fear that reading for enjoyment has become one of the lost arts children have so many other forms of recreation to compete for their timesports in the afternoons television in the evenings trips on the week ends that they have little opportunity to establish the reading habit i recall happily the rainy afternoons and the long evenings which i spent reading through all the children books on the shelves of the branch library near my home on my twelfth birthday i received gifts in the form of cash which i carried proudly to the downtown secondhand bookstore and invested after a day of browsing in a twenty volume complete set of sir walter scott and a thirty volume complete set of charles dickens and during the next two years i read them all when i was thirteen i secured an advertising pamphlet of the globe wernicke company entitled the world best books and i was naive enough to believe that it was my duty to read them all listed in the pamphlet were the titles of the harvard classics and since my father had the set in our library
trends and developments in higher education  at home i started with volume i and proceeded on through the five foot shelf this was very heavy reading for a teenager but i plowed ahead often without comprehension this is why i say that the immature reader should be helped in his selection of books on the other hand i built up the habit of voluminous reading which has stood me in good stead all my life of course some of the books were trivial such as horatio alger success stories or the adventures of tom swift frank merriwell and the rover boys but i learned many of the facts of history from henty and joseph altsheler and they led me on to stevenson dumas hugo thackeray and others of high quality when i arrived at college the habit of reading was so ingrained that i dropped in every day for an hour in the farnsworth room of the widener library and read my way straight through the beautifully bound sets of clemens shaw and galsworthy to this day i can resist the blandishments of radio and television if i can have a good book waiting in my study and i thank my lucky stars that i was allowed to become an ardent reader when i was a child i suppose it is never too late to mend and our college education should give every encouragement to leisure reading but it is best if begun early it has been said that the best university is a collection of books and certainly the college library provided the gold mine in which the students aided by the faculty can dig for the riches of our civilization although our culture is largely contained in books it is also in music and art and must be heard and seen higher education must provide opportunities for listening to the best in music and drama and in sufficient quantities to make a lasting impression perhaps radio chief contribution to our civilization is the tremendous rise in music appreciation which it has brought about if color television can do the same service for our appreciation of painting and its allied arts may the day be hastened but it is not well enough that we teach enjoyment we must teach the skills of creation as well the creative technique of philosophy is meditation and thought of literature it is writing of music it is singing or playing an instrument or composing of dramatics it is acting of the graphic and plastic arts it is drawing and painting and sculpture what exclaims the skeptic are we expected to make accomplished artists in a dozen fields of course not but g k chesterton in one of his characteristic paradoxes advised vwhatever is worth doing is worth doing poorly by this i take him to mean that even though we may never acquire any real skill we should try our hand at a number of creative tasks in order that we may truly appreciate art when it is well done and in the process we may at least learn to write clear and effective english prose ability to write correctly in one own native tongue is a cultural goal which we have a right to demand of every college graduate so far i have spoken only of the instructional function of a university in the humanities the faculty in these departments must also carry on research into our cultural heritage to provide new light upon the past for many years under the powerful influence of the new sciences research in the humanities aped the scientific techniques and jargon and nothing was acceptable unless it was philology or archeology or musicology today however there is a strong interest in rhetorical analysis aesthetic criticism and examination of
 the library quarterly art in artistic terms some of our graduate schools are permitting students to present a novel or play or symphony in place of the traditional doctoral research dissertation faculty members of our universities are expected to work in our research libraries and studios and to direct other workers in the production of books and paintings and operas which in turn become a part of our cultural heritage the service function of the university to the humanities is carried on by the university library or libraries by the museums and by the public performances of theater orchestra or chorus administrators are accustomed to hear groans about the high expense of adding thousands of books each year to the libraries or of maintaining museums with their manifold services but how can a university become a true treasure house of culture if it has neither books nor artifacts we will all agree that particularly in our larger cities students and faculty should make use of the agencies of culture which exist away from the campus and the university should supplement rather than merely duplicate the colleges of new york city for example can never hope to rival the collection of the metropolitan museum of art or the music of the philharmonic and the metropolitan opera or the professional theater of broadway therefore they should bring their students in touch with the best where it is and spend their own funds to develop other areas the cultural function of higher education has been central for seven centuries the same is true of its purpose as a builder and strengthener of character the earliest universities were established as an arn of the church a major reason was the preparation of a learned clergy religion was taken for granted as the binding element in all education when the first american colleges were founded and for many years thereafter the presidents were ordained ministers who presided over the daily worship services taught the required senior course in christian ethics and looked to the healthful spiritual growth of every student the entire atmosphere of the college was such that it assumed that the character of the individual would be strengthened by living there for four years the growing secularization of our universities during the past century has shifted the focus upon character development from a religious to a psychological center instead of piety and selfsacrifice we now talk of self realization self fulfilment self reliance self respect and self government in the personal rather than the political sense yet there is dissatisfaction with a merely biological interpretation of individual differences as dean theodore blegen said recently at a conference in albany man is not a blood powered adjunct to a tractor in their recent report on preparation for medical school in liberal arts colleges deans severinghaus carman and cadbury applauded a growing concern for moral values   personal and social responsibility    ethical and moral problems  service to one fellow man the question is what can the college do about character liberal education is by definition the education of free men preparation for freedom but freedom has no meaning unless man has a choice and when we make a choice we exercise our sense of values professor george counts in his recent book education and american civilization states the issue thus the essence of any civilization is found in its values in its preferences its moral commit

 the library quarterly is an area of great opportunity psychiatry deals with the pathology of character and educational psychology has limited itself too strictly to the elementary and secondary levels we need research in the growth of character among mature normal men and women the early college contented itself with a curriculum built chiefly around culture and character actual training for the professions of medicine and law was secured by reading in a doctor or lawyer office but during the second quarter of the nineteenth century engineering and law and medicine began to establish schools and curriculums and eventually many of these schools became affiliated with universities normal schools grew into teachers colleges the morrill act of  set up schools of agriculture mostly in connection with state colleges and universities and during the past century there has been a steady growth in the number and size of professional schools of business pharmacy music journalism nursing architecture forestry veterinary medicine osteopathy optometry dentistry social work and library science all these occupations now call themselves professions because their vocational training is given at the college or postcollege level but the educational program prescribed for the degree is designed not so much for culture or character as for competence if we engage a dentist to work on our teeth or an architect to build our house we may be happy to know that he is steeped in the literary and artistic heritage of the human race and we hope that he is honest and humane but we insist that he know the techniques of his trade the medieval curriculum of grammar logic rhetoric arithmetic geometry music and astronomy was constructed for the needs of a leisure class society and the priesthood today america really has no leisure class though we all may be striving to reach that level on retirement in this country we expect every man or woman to pull his own weight in the boat regardless of inherited wealth every man works for self respect even if he does not need to work for a living the sons of john d rockefeller jr provide an excellent example of americans at work with such an emphasis upon competence at some useful occupation it is natural that vocational programs should dominate higher education of the approximately  degrees granted in the united states in  only  were in the liberal arts the other  were earned in professional schools at the undergraduate and graduate levels and it would be safe to say that most of the degrees in liberal arts were intended for use as tickets of admission to business or teaching or scientific work or home economics or to graduate schools certainly there is nothing low or venial in vocational motivation educators should welcome motivation to study almost without regard to source the vision of a professional diploma at the end may carry the student through many a subject which in itself has little intrinsic interest for him even if the vocational drive lasts for only a short time it may perform a valuable function especially if it is succeeded by another and stronger drive many a student shifts his sights from one profession to another particularly during his undergraduate career and there is no harm done actually his education is probably broader as a result in the area of vocational and professional competence the university has many functions first of all it helps to
trends and developments in higher education  select and sift the suitable candidates for the various professions tests of vocational interest and aptitude have been developed to a point where they are very helpful but they must be supplemented by academic records general mental ability tests and personal interviews certain professional schools are much stiffer in their entrance requirements than others partly because the profession places an arbitrary limitation on numbers some professions demand from two to four years of liberal arts training before admission to the study of the craft whereas others include the training in the undergraduate years the logic of these differentiations is sometimes hard to perceive in the teaching of the professions the question is constantly asked can a man be a good teacher without also being a good practitioner the desire to combine theory with practice has led to a considerable movement back and forth between the classroom and the professional office in medical schools for example only a few members of the clinical faculty are full time teachers and these few practice medicine or surgery in order that they may show to the students the latest techniques many teachers in the business school or engineering school spend a day or two each week and their summer vacations with a corporation on a retainer basis if held within reasonable bounds this practice should be encouraged sabbatical years are frequently used to refresh the professor acquaintance with the harsh facts of the world outside members of the profession through their guild organizations are inclined to demand a share in the planning of the curriculum and in the accrediting of the schools themselves this has produced some upgrading of faculty and teaching but has also proved a millstone around the neck of the universities there is a strong movement under way to simplify and unify the whole accrediting process it is in the professions the field of competence that the research function of the universities has mushroomed to fantastic proportions in at least two great engineering colleges the budget for research exceeds the entire budget for the remainder of the institution and a similar proportion or lack of proportion prevails in the budgets of medical schools colleges of agriculture and departments of physics or chemistry in  over  was spent on organized research mostly in the sciences now that the federal government has discovered the research abilities of university faculties most of this research money comes from washington the recently established national science foundation is merely another step in the same direction even the private foundations show a preference for the professional schools when they make grants for investigations and it must be admitted that this constant stimulus from public and private sources has produced amazing results most of the recent nobel prize winners in science have been university professors and our medical schools have produced some of the magical cures of our day in like manner university services are also very heavy in the professional fields university hospitals medical clinics for diagnosis and treatment short refresher courses for business executives or teachers practicing law institutes and the burgeoning enterprise of adult education and extension courses have become an important part of many universities just as uncle sam has found universities helpful so the professional men desire to maintain a continuing relationship of
