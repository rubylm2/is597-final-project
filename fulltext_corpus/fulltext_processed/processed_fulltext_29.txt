journal of education for library and information science another view of this issue was reported in an earlier study of black undergraduates at white colleges that research found a low level of student contact with faculty outside the classroom it also revealed that some  to  percent of the students never conferred with a teacher during the course of a semester    and  percent feel that they get little if any help from faculty members and advisors this lack of connection between faculty advisors and students while less apparent within these library schools than at the undergraduate level discussed here can be interpreted and justified variously what emerges from both levels however is a discrepancy in perceived faculty responsibility to students  a situation that deserves periodic reassessment question were you required to do remedial work which was unnecessary often sometimes seldom never uncertain      an overwhelming majority of the respondents    indicated that this never happened to them the sole sometimes response might suggest a need to have attended more closely to admissions requirements or to the adequacy of quality advisement provided to this student both preferential admissions of inadequately prepared students and incompetent advisement reflect poorly upon institutions they also constitute significant acts of social injustice in that the covert hypocrisy ultimately serves to frustrate and discourage the student unnecessarily question was your association with the school loudly proclaimed when it seemed to be of benefit to the school often sometimes seldom never uncertain      an almost equal number of respondents felt sure  as felt uncertain  that when the fact of their presence at the school was likely to add prestige to the program that information was touted this was never the understanding of  of the students question was it made clear to you that you were important for the federal funds you generated for the school often sometimes seldom never uncertain      while a large majority of the respondents  indicated that this never happened to them   reported uncertainty despite the seeming conflict of being uncertain about whether a position is made clear an equal proportion of men and women were uncertain while twice as many women as men reported that this had never happened to them or that it had happened seldom and sometimes question from the beginning were you treated as if you were below the standard expectations for students   volume   number

journal of education for library and information science ing experiences a representative selection appears below unfortunately the overall experience with the faculty was marred by the fact that being a westerner from an area with few blacks i did not seem to fit into their stereotypical approaches to dealing with blacks from the south or large urban areas and they did not know how to respond to me one professor told me that they had called a faculty meeting to discuss me one of the most pleasant outcomes of the experience was that it forced me to network with other librarians  black brown and white  who shared my concern on social issues i had no sense of the school spirit  experienced at other schools very little was done on the graduate level to foster a bond between the university and the student particularly the black student my experiences were good ones    but only because i tend to be a strong person under adverse conditions it was a very depressing experience and not representative of my accustomed quality of life or existence  i came to library school right from college with misguided expectations of a lily white environment in which no one cared about me the overall quality was negative summary library schools like many other professional schools admit a foremost concern with promoting the intellectual character of the profession through their programs courses and activities the preparation of students for the delivery of information and related services to all segments of society implies an appreciable measure of humanistic concern for the advancement of humankind through increased and efficient availability of knowledge and information to all this focus on graduate educational experiences is important in order to provide information regarding black students views of the learning environments that resulted from the recently integrated higher educational opportunities this study explored the nature however intentional of the social and educational conditioning of black graduate students within predominantly white library schools the period from  to  was chosen because it represented a time during which social and political forces merged to effect increased opportunities for blacks and other minorities to enter the american mainstream for many of the respondents to this survey theirs was a firstgeneration experience of higher education on predominantly white campuses in addition to creating changes in the makeup of campus constituents the presence of blacks provided a degree of special vulnerability for themselves and led to different experiences for the total college community the findings of this study indicate a variety of experiences that range in quality from excellent to awful with most students not remembering them as being onerous majority experiences indicate that these students were not treated as if they were below standard expectations neither were their classroom   volume   number 
black students contributions regarded as of less importance than those of other students the majority did not feel themselves to be on display when it seemed to benefit the school they also felt that white students tended to be distant and unfriendly the majority indicated the absence of discriminatory grading practices and racial insults by their instructors they were not required to do remediad work were not valued solely for the federal funds attached to their enrollment did not experience deliberate advisor unavailability and felt that their experiences were typical a relatively high degree of uncertainty was indicated overall however the structure of the questionnaire did not allow for the determination of how these responses are related to memory lapse willful avoidance or other coping mechanisms these findings indicate that the predominantly white library schools reflected in this study were not extremely inhospitable toward their black students however within every category explored respondents reported some offensive treatment this information seems to support the need for continuous and constructive nurturing of attitudes and images by which librarianship in its quest to clarify and define itself will ultimately be regarded references  higginbotham jr a l in the matter of color new york oxford univ pr  p    harris w h  and levey j s  the new columbia encyclopedia new york columbia univ pr  p   epps e a  black students in white schools worthington ohio charles a jones pubi co   willie c v andmccord a s black students at white colleges new york praeger   josey e j the black librarian in america metuchen nj scarecrow pr    jones v l a dean career injosey e j ref  p   totten h l a survey and evaluation of minority programs in selected graduate library schools journal of education for librarianship  summer   black caucus of american library association membership directory th ed yan   willie and mccord ref  p  bibliography boxili b r blacks and social justice totowa nj rowman and allanheld  p   giddings p when and where i enter    new york morrow  p sarratt r the ordeal of desegregation new york harper and row  winter
