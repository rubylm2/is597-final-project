some social aspects of public library development in israel shmuel sever historical roots t he israeli library system must be understood as the result of a cultural and social tradition and a historical pattern that developed over centuries with the modern israel state as its culmination the cultural tradition of the jews a tradition transplanted to israel deeply respects learning and books in the cheder the jew nourished the roots that will eventually blossom into a veritable passion for studying although the culture prevailing now in israel was brought mostly from europe israel population comes to an important extent from afro asian countries mainly arabic speaking countries but even in the arab countries where illiteracy prevailed the jewish child or more exactly the jewish male child was not completely illiterate he knew at least how to read his prayers and the scriptures this relatively high cultural level of a large proportion of the jewish population created a demand for books and these traditional books were not only religious jewish religion and culture have during the centuries amalgamated and only in the last century or so has a division between religion and culture arisen among the jewish masses even during the middle ages in western europe when books were scarce and learning was nearly a monopoly of the clergy the ownership and use of books were widespread among jews in jewish communities there were many discussions about the degree of duty to lend books but there was no unanimity in this respect in some instances the borrower was admonished to preserve the borrowed book sometimes special recommendations from the leading scholars of the community were needed but usually the community put pressure on the owner of books to lend them in one instance the community even fined the owner of books for failing to lend them in addition to privately owned books every beit midrash a kind of school for adult education in the synagogue had a library with varying quantities of books some aspects of the social structure israel had its modern beginnings in the late nineteenth century there has always been immigration of jews to israel palestine but in  began the first wave of immigrants whose motivation was national not religious the ark zborowsky the place of book learning in traditional jewish culture in margaret mead and martha wolfenstein eds childhood in contemporary cultures chicago university of chicago press  p  hlomo d goitein jewish education in yemen as an archetype of traditional jewish education in carl frankenstein ed between past and future essays and studies on aspects of immigrant absorption in israel jerusalem henrietta szold foundation for child and youth welfare  pp   braham meir habermann toldoth hassefer hd ivri history of the hebrew book jerusalem r mas  pp   
public library development in israel  first immigrants came from russia from eastern europe and interestingly enough with no formal or institutional connection to the european movement from yemen during the years before the establishment of the israeli state several waves of immigration created new forms of settlement such as the kibbutz and the moshav the majority of the immigrants settled in urban settlements but in the rural areas the moshav and the kibbutz prevailed the kibbutz has always been a minority movement in the rural settlement but its cultural impact was important because of its special human element the men and women who built the kibbutz movement were in the main intellectuals from europe while they deliberately changed their occupation to that of farmers they wanted at the same time to create an educated cultured peasant class    all the major settlement unions have their own publishing houses the cultural educational and technical publications put out by them run into the hundreds every year   practically every collective settlement has its own library which carries beside books the most important national newspapers and magazines and a collection of phonograph records the main influence of the kibbutz on israel culture has been on youth for many years the ideal of israeli youth has been to live in a kibbutz and a high proportion of the sabra generation israeli born did so for various periods of time this has always been an elite movement and consequently could not attract a high percentage of immigration the moshav the co operative farm was less revolutionary in its lebensanschauung and could during the years attract more people when mass immigration began in  the moshav form was adopted for the new settlements in the veteran moshavim organized prior to  cultural aims were still close to the kibbutz pattern according to the united nations survey mission findings in  each moshav ovdim has a cultural committee which plans and executes local programmes   this committee also concerns itself with the maintenance of the local library in the immigrant moshav settlements founded after  however the situation was different while the older moshavim were primarily voluntary the newer immigrants were sent to the settlements by the jewish agency without their having a previous cultural or ideological basis for this kind of life since israel is a democracy no one was forced to live in the new moshav and indeed many left but the foundation of this settlement was not a voluntary one the population from both the european and afro asian countries in the immigrant moshav was of a lower educational and cultural level than that of the veteran population of israel thus cultural institutions had to be supplied from outside or with powerful outside encouragement in the fifties the new settlements were planned within the state by the settlement department of the jewish nited nations series on community organization and development monograph on community settlements and report of the survey mission on community organization and development israel united nations department of social affairs  pp   ibid p  udah matras social change in israel chicago aldine publishing co  gives a thorough survey of modern israel social structure and currents
 the library quarterly agency and a new concept of settlement evolved the comprehensive regional settlement the system introduced some industry into the rural areas in addition to agriculture and tended to bring to the rural population health and cultural services comparable to those of the city dwellers it organized several small rural settlements around a rural center where tractor stations elementary schools a clinic a meeting hall and sometimes a small library are found several such units of rural settlements with their rural centers are part of a larger region usually with a town as its center the larger center accommodates larger industrial plants a health center with some specialized medical care a regional high school a community center and in recent years a library the radius of such a region usually does not exceed ten miles and its population varies from ten thousand to twenty thousand people the mass immigration of the late forties and fifties brought with it in addition to other economic and social problems of a mass immigration the awareness of group differences arising from cultural and ethnic origins it became clear that the social differences were not only between the immigrants and the veterans but they were also a product of the country of origin these problems had existed prior to  but with less public emphasis in  the european american born accounted for  per cent of the jewish population and the oriental jews born in asia and africa only  per cent the rest being israeli born the relative number of oriental jews increased to   per cent in  and to  per cent in  the percentage of the european born population decreased to  per cent in  and to  per cent in  the government as well as public institutions like the jewish agency the histadrut and many others tried to raise the cultural and social level in a few years but the problem persisted because of unsuitable methods and also because blending so many people of such diverse backgrounds into a common culture is not a process to be carried out in a short time literacy campaigns were pursued through compulsory education to age fourteen and many adult education courses were instituted mostly in hebrew in courses sponsored by the government thousands of adults participated courses were also organized by the histadrut and the jewish agency the army had and still has important acculturation roles courses in hebrew and elementary subjects are provided to every soldier needing them since in israel military service is compulsory for every citizen eighteen years of age the army exerted a powerful educational influence in the last few years many girls upon graduation from high school have served as teachers of hebrew for adults in rural areas as part of their military service it is probable that social upward mobility is a function of education in israel high school education is not compulsory and is rather expensive the european born or sons of european raanan weitz the next stage in agricultural settlement jerusalem jewish agency settlement department   matras op cit see n  p  statistical abstract of israel vol   pt b table  p  alex weingrod israel group relations in a new society london pall mall press published for the institute of race relations  tatistical abstract of israel vol   table t p 
public library development in israel  born for whom studying is a tradition and who usually have a better economic and social status tend to give their children high school and higher education thus providing a better social status for them the tradition of formal education is absent among oriental jews parents having poorer education and lower economic and social status themselves do not tend to promote continuance of their children education thus tempering the social status of their sons this situation creates understandably tensions in israeli society in the fifties the government sought to improve the high school education including vocational of the underprivileged classes mostly of oriental stock or the new immigrants by assigning scholarships to worthy children the system did not fully fulfil its expectations in  the government decided to participate more actively in the high school education by providing graded fees which took into account income number of children and housing conditions of the family as well as the student achievements at school because the oriental israelis are a sizable part of this group having lower incomes and many children this arrangement seemed more beneficial to them than for other groups in addition a preferential scheme which was implemented but not much publicized was developed on the assumption that lack of scholarly tradition and conditions at home do handicap the oriental child in order to provide more impetus the official preferential scheme graded its school fees for students from oriental stock even when their academic achievements were lower than those of the children of the european or israeli born and even if the father income was relatively higher the system also provided additional courses in the afternoons and in summer to help bring these students up to the needed standards it also proposed to avoid the lowering of the academic standards by trying to have mixed populations in high school in the elementary schools of neighborhoods with predominantly oriental population the school day was extended educational television was also instituted in order to help the student population of rural and development towns in getting better teaching when the system began in the school year   only  students benefited from it in   there were  students in the system a significant number in a country with a population of two and a half millions existing social studies cannot yet measure the impact of this reform upon the note of social change but one may guess it will help the social integration of the oriental jews who already show features of upward mobility it is of considerable interest to note that many years often generations of residence in arab countries where upward mobility for jews was very difficult apparently did not cause the jews in these countries to internalize a norm of immobility    among the jewish immigrants observed here however a latent desire for mobility seems to have prevailed integration will be helped also by the fact that although intergroup tensions exist the moral and ideological standards prevailing in the country discourage prejudice the war of june  was undoubtedly an integrating ibid tables t t pp    weingrod op cit see n  p  judith t shuval immigrants on the threshold the atherton press behavioral science series new york atherton press  p 
 the library quarterly factor although it is difficult to know to what extent before leaving the subject it is of some value to consider the relative magnitude of the rural population in israel only  per cent of the total population of israel is rural the jewish rural population is only  per cent of the total population of this the kibbutzim have  per cent the moshavim  per cent roughly divided as  per cent veteran and  per cent new and  per cent are in private rural settlements the  per cent non jewish rural population are the majority of the arab population of israel and should be treated separately reading patterns a survey of book and newspaper reading in israel taken from a representative sample of the adult population was carried out in the budget year  april   march   by the central bureau of statistics we will confine ourselves here to the examination of the book reading part of the survey subjects were asked if they had read at least one book during the month preceding the survey the resulting picture of the book reading habits of the israeli population shows data different from those of other countries at least  per cent of israelis read one book the month preceding the survey of those surveyed  per cent of the men were readers and  per cent of the women unlike other countries where women account for a higher proportion among readers the disparity arises from the fact that women of oriental origin coming to israel after school age are less educated another unusual feature is that  per cent of the age group   years were readers the percentage declines to  per cent for the group of   years and to only  per cent for the  years and over group the difference in reading patterns is sharpened by the fact that the   age group includes the period of military service   for men   for women as well as the time of achieving a career and building a family and home while the group of  years and over includes the retired better education of the younger generation helps explain these differences the country of origin has a significant influence on the reading habits of the israeli of the israeli born  per cent read compared with only  per cent of the oriental israelis and  per cent of the european born relevant to practical implications for the libraries is the spread of reading by type of settlement in older urban settlements founded before   per cent read while in the newer urban settlements having a higher percentage of new immigrants only  per cent read for the rural population the figures are  per cent for veteran settlements and only  per cent for newer settlements the high reading percentage in the older rural settlements probably arises from a relatively high cultural level and less competition for reading time than in the city the lower reading habits of the new rural settlements lower than the new urban settlement is due not only to difstatistical abstract of israel vol   table t p   dan lacy the adult in a changing society implications for the public library in lester asheim ed new directions in public library development chicago university of chicago graduate library school  pp    compare findings to y deligdisch and r cohen reader survey at the kiriat ha yovel library unesco bulletin for libraries    
public library development in israel  ferences between rural and urban patterns for these patterns have not had time to develop in israel but because the newer rural settlements are populated almost entirely by new immigrants with a high percentage of afro asian origin the survey also concerned itself with the languages in which the readers read and discovered that  per cent of the readers read only hebrew books  per cent read only in a foreign language and  per cent read both hebrew and a foreign language unsurprisingly the younger generation reads more hebrew than the older generation the reading of the israeli born is hebrew or hebrew plus a foreign language but it is quite surprising to find that  per cent of the israeli born read only a foreign language the fact has not been investigated but one of its causes may be that some readers switched to english in the fifties when foreign paper back books were especially inexpensive another factor may be the poor quality of detective stories in hebrew the european born read more in a foreign language than in hebrew  per cent hebrew  per cent foreign language understandably since not all have mastered hebrew enough to enjoy reading it the situation is different with the afro asian born  per cent read only hebrew while  per cent read only in a foreign language which may be explained by the fact that they acquired their reading habits in israel it is worth noting that children and teenagers did not participate in the survey presumably their reading patterns are higher than those of the adult population and their main reading language is hebrew casual surveys of the reading habits of children strengthen this belief book reading is not necessarily connected with libraries in israel as in the united states there are inexpensive paperback editions book clubs etc book buying is quite widespread in israel more so among the israeli and european born than among others it is probable that the library can play an important role in widening the reading habits of that part of the population not yet familiar with it the public library the roots of the israeli public library can be traced to the end of the nineteenth century when the beit sefarim le bnei israel library of the israel people petach tikva and other libraries were founded the beit sefarim le bnei israel later also known as the chazanowitz collection was predecessor of the jewish national and university library jnul in  dr heinrich loewe of berlin advocated in his book eine jiidische national bibliothek the founding in palestine of a library which would include functions of a public library modeled on british and american libraries and would also establish a library school for the training of librarians dr loewe proposed sending a young librarian at the beginning of his career to palestine to accomplish these goals in effect fifteen years later in  dr hugo bergmann from the university of prague was sent by the zionist organization to  y deligdisch reading survey in a children library yad la kori june    in hebrew  rivka guber the library educates new immigrants yad la kore july august    in hebrew  arundell esdaile national libraries of the world their history administration and public services d ed completely revised by f j hill london library association  p

 the library quarterly and the newer libraries founded during the fifties had with one exception the naharya public library  the same features in common israel presents the somewhat novel situation of book provision far beyond its present capacity to organize and service adequately one often encounters home made or nonexistent systems of book classification in some libraries the books seem to be chaotically assembled and the records so confused that it is impossible to know what is available thus the wholly admirable zeal for books becomes stifled by the very mass of books assembled in inadequate quarters and poorly administered school libraries which are very similar in outlook and philosophy to the public libraries were even worse with few exceptions most schools had no library at all until  in the fifties and sixties they grew in quantity until nearly every school had a library but what was referred to as the library was closed cupboards opened once or twice a week when the teacher changed the books or a dark corner where browsing was impossible reading is now encouraged by teachers but it tends to become part of the curriculum thus being hardly conducive to love of reading or libraries especially for children who lack a reading tradition at home this situation is better in the new schools especially in the development towns where more space is provided for book collections and budget allocation from the ministry of education is larger in some development towns interesting experiments have been carried out but special space for libraries is not included in the physical facilities of most elementary schools and the professional library of the elementary school is still a hope of the future in high schools the situation is better many high schools developed libraries with large collections modern administration systems have been introduced and professional librarians are beginning to enter this field but here too much more is needed the development of school libraries will probably occur as part of an over all library policy and library system during the next decade new trends of the public library a landmark in the development of israel public libraries was the establishment in  of a small public library in a suburb of jerusalem qiriatha yovel formerly beit mazmil with the help of unesco and under the supervision of the then new graduate library school of hebrew university this suburb served as a human laboratory for intergroup relations in  a sociological survey also sponsored by unesco was carried out there on intergroup tensions and affinities in   in the newly established library a study of library needs in a multigroup society was carried out and its impact on library developephraim joel the public library of naharya yad la korg april september   in hebrew  carnovsky op cit see n  pp   w jacob rothschild the elementary school library yad la korj august    in hebrew rivka guber lending library of regional schools of immigrant settlements jerusalem israel library association  mimeographed in hebrew  margaret mead israel and problems of identity new york herzl institute  pamphlet  p   judith t shuval patterns of inter group tension and affinity international social science bulletin    deligdisch and cohen op cit see n 
public library development in israel  ments was important far beyond its actual findings the main stimulus toward a real change in public libraries came from outside the library field in the midfifties and early sixties it was felt that the much sought integration of the new immigrants was proceeding slower than expected merely providing the immigrants with houses elementary education jobs or even job training was not enough the integration of disjointed communities from all over the world into a unified nation is more of a social than an ethnic problem it depends mainly on education in the schools and outside    it is with a great deal of satisfaction that we can point to the splendid achievements in the field of education  per cent of jewish and  per cent of arab children go to school and constant efforts are made to include every child in israel more and more teachers are trained school rooms added vocational training expanded very little however is done for education outside school walls education was by no means the only proposal the sociologists voiced in israel long before their ideas were crystallized in print but education in a broad meaning was adopted by the government as the key to integration abba eban serving as minister of education in his opening address to the second ila conference in  summarized the importance of public libraries as an educational tool emphasizing their social role he stressed the fact that in israel at least the population migration from rural and town settlements toward the big cities is due not only to better economic conditions but to better educational facilities the library being one of these facilities in this address he defined the future policy of the ministry of education toward the public libraries   the public library should be encouraged in every settlement  the school library should be developed along the principles of public libraries  the ministry of education will subsidize libraries and provide professional help only to settlements which are unable to support a library service themselves  the ministry will seek the help and advice of professional librarians and their representative bodies in implementing its policy toward libraries  universities should be required to provide academic programs for librarians and academic status should be granted to librarians it is interesting to discover five years later that this policy has been carried out almost to the letter with the exception of school libraries by the ministry of education a committee for public libraries was appointed by the ministry of education under the chairmanship of dr c wormann director of the jnul and the graduate library school of hebrew university this committee includes one representative for each of the parliamentary committee for education and culture the ministry of education the jewish national and university library the graduate library school the technion the municipal library of tel  weingrod op cit see n  p  itzhak kanev social policy in israel achievements and shortcomings tel aviv social research institute  pp   i abba eban opening address of the ila conference  yad la kord june    our culture at crossroads yad lakorj april september   in hebrew

public library development in israel  by the activities of the center of public libraries it should be noted that the classification of urban settlements is less clear than that of rural settlements and to some degree is deceiving towns existing before  will rate as veteran even if for all practical purposes their population is not for instance bat yam with a population of  in  and  in  will rate as an old settlement as will akko acre with a population of  in  and  in  nonetheless something can be learned from a survey conducted by the central bureau of statistics on libraries in urban settlements in three alternating years     and   the very time of the beginning of the public library expansion and at a time when new immigration had almost ceased the total number of libraries in urban settlements was  in  increasing in number to  in  and  n  the number of readers registered as patrons increased by  per cent in the five year span the percentage of the total population reading in libraries increased from  per cent in  to  per cent in  the book collections grew at the same rate in the three big cities of jerusalem tel aviv and haifa the number of libraries remained relatively static  in   in  but their collections were consolidated and the number of readers grew by  per cent in other urban settlements new and veteran the growth has been more marked in   libraries existed with a total book collection of  volumes and  registered readers in  forty five new libraries were opened bringing the number to  with total collections to  volumes and  registered readers in the new settlements only which were part of the last group the libraries number grew from forty two to fiftyfive and the number of readers more than doubled as did the number of books but they still lagged behind the rest this lag diminished in  and  but it should be stressed again that although the ministry of education helps and encourages establishment of new libraries if the local authority is not prepared to participate no library is opened because the population and authorities in some new towns and arab settlements were unprepared to even partially support a library the libraries did not open in  and  new libraries were opened in development towns sometimes not because the need for a library was felt but because a library in town became a status symbol and the ministry wanted to help develop this cultural symbol nonetheless the youth of these cities used their libraries and enjoyed them public libraries in rural settlements in rural settlements group sociocultural differences and therefore variations in library patterns are more clearly seen than in the urban settlements in the rural settlements there were in   libraries compared with  in urban settlements these libraries were found mainly in the kibbutz or the veteran moshav the per capita number of books in the kibbutz is double the number of books available per registered reader in a public library  volumes per inhabitant of the kibbutz compared to  volumes for the statistical abstract of israel vol   table t p   israel ministry of education and culture library section list of public libraries jerusalem june  pp   in hebrew
 the library quarterly reader in the public library one of the factors is undoubtedly better reading habits among kibbutz inhabitants as we have already seen but another factor is the fact that private buying of books is more restricted in the kibbutz than in urban settlements because the amount of money available to kibbutz members is limited with few exceptions the kibbutz libraries are not attended by professional librarians in some the librarian works part time or even on a voluntary basis after working hours the trend is toward full time workers in libraries but even now the situation is not serious owing to the restricted number of readers and to separate children libraries which are affiliated with schools or with the separate children quarters which exist in most kibbutzim the libraries of the  per cent of veteran moshavim vary widely in their standards but a majority of them have small collections with few resources the situation of the immigrant moshavim was much more serious their economic situation and more their cultural tradition and sense of values held little hope for library development the solution could be only the regional library as a matter of fact in  a group of moshav librarians actually led by one of them planned the establishment of a regional library in emek hefer the situation began changing in  when the section for public libraries entered the field encouraging establishment of regional libraries and subsidizing them heavily also with the help of yad rotschild until march  ten such regional libraries were established serving  settlements mostly moshavim in some instances the central regional libraries were located in development towns that is centers of comprehensive regions thus serving also the local population in other instances the centers of regional libraries were located in cities jerusalem and petach tikva for example the centers located in cities are not the well developed public libraries of these same cities but actually processing and storing centers for collections circulated to the branches or circulated through bookmobiles this duplication of library resources is probably uneconomical both in terms of money and manpower some shortcomings of the library system the libraries of israel have taken an important step forward in the last few years their development can be regarded as a developing library system still several shortcomings which possibly could be avoided and might have a lasting influence on their future are discernible israel being a small nation within a small area a more centralized administrative system than that in existence could be envisioned and was proposed in broad lines by carnovsky in  but it was not implemented the peril of censorship from any nationally authoritative office is as yet very slight in israel because the government and all local authorities are run by a coalition of parties ranging from socialist to conservative from atheistic to ultra religious besides the government interference which exists in the system is so far beneficial centralization could bring only more efficiency to the extent of central influence which already exists co ordination of acqui ruth porath the emek hefer region plans the setting up of a central library yad la kore june    in hebrew  edmond james de rothschild memorial group op cit see n 
public library development in israel  sition policies between the individual libraries is non existent and any economies of such co ordination are lost in jerusalem itself the municipal library is buying every book published in israel while less than two miles away the jnul has kept the same policy for more than half a century and now receives by law two copies of every book published co ordination between histadrut libraries and public libraries of the same city is all but non existent the distances in israel being short some co ordination in acquisition policies could be developed in the whole country between the cities themselves another unfortunate aspect of this problem is the lack of well defined acquisition policies in most individual libraries another expression of this lack of cooperation is the absence of interlibrary loans a peculiar inadequacy since the system exists within special and science libraries of the country union catalogs do not exist in the public library although they are used by science libraries a union catalog of scientific periodicals has been issued in two editions and a third edition is planned and a union catalog of science books exists at the technion library the success of the card catalog service only emphasizes how much more could be done in centralizing processing of books as hinted elsewhere the regional libraries are serving restricted areas and populations it is interesting to note that while local patriotism is not developed in israel in the political and social life or health services for that matter it is developed where libraries are involved one is led to suspect that this development is due in no small measure to librarians and it is a pity that the ministry of education did not try to restrict this phenomenon the fact that regional libraries have independent centers and do not use the next door public libraries is a somewhat extravagant feature in a far from outstandingly wealthy country recognition of librarianship as a profession library development of the last years though not prompted mainly by librarians could not occur without the establishment of librarianship as a profession in israel since the  professional librarians could be found in israel some came to palestine after finishing library schools in europe and the united states while others were sent to europe by the jnul in the late twenties to study librarianship still librarianship has been recognized as a profession only in the last few years it is worth mentioning that two library traditions amalgamated in israel the american and the german the last three directors of the jnul were trained in germany and held important positions in germanspeaking libraries before arriving in israel in the late twenties several librarians of this library were sent to paris to study at an ala sponsored school an american librarian sophia udin influenced the establishment of dewey classification at the jnul as well as the organization of other libraries notably the knesset parliament library and the university of tel aviv library outside jnul with few exceptions the librarian was thought to be a custodian of books and the library a refuge for an aging scholar or even for someone who had failed in other occupations inside the profession the largest group of professionals was found at jnul this group and dr c wormann the director of jnul contributed most toward the recognition of librarianship
 the library quarterly three formal landmarks can be recognized in this development  the founding of the israel library association ila in in  the total number of librarians of all kinds was estimated to be around  professional librarians accounted for less than  per cent of this number but they were concentrated at the jnul and at the technion at the initiative of some librarians ila was founded it published library material but concentrated in leading the struggle for professional recognition and better salaries for librarians in the sixties it also instituted external examinations for certifying non academic librarians  the establishment of the graduate library school of hebrew university in the need for training librarians in the country was felt after world war ii and was advocated by wormann in  the war of independence and the task of rebuilding jnul postponed the opening of the school israel turned to unesco for help and carnovsky was sent in  as an advisor upon his recommendations a graduate library school was opened in  at the hebrew university its curriculum was modeled on american and british practice from  fifteen to twenty librarians graduated annually and many hold key positions in israel libraries the shortage of librarians prevailing now in israel denies early fears of limited possibilities of their absorption in the foreseeable future  the recognition of professional salary schedules by the government in the existence of a relatively important body of academic librarians graduated in israel and abroad certification of non academic librarians by the ila as well as its professional struggle brought to the recognition of the profession first by the histadrut and later the social conditions being favorable by the government the need for professional salary schedules the first step was taken in  on the recognition by the histadrut of a salary scale for librarians beginning with a grade parallel to that of a medium grade clerk the government did not recognize this scale but it was adopted by several academic institutions thus influencing librarians salaries throughout the country in  another scale for librarians with degrees was recommended by the histadrut and was received by several universities for their librarians in  the government recognized this scale thus extending its recognition to the profession as a whole the local authorities and public bodies to which most of israel libraries belong use the governmental scales in grading their employees this scale linked salaries to those of engineers and although the beginning librarian usually starts one or two grades lower than the beginning engineer the change of the salary situation compared to that of the fifties is remarkable a new scale also was worked out for the non academic librarians improving their salaries one may hope that improved salaries will also improve the social status and the professional prestige of librarians  deligdish new developments in israel public libraries op cit see n   thompson op cit see n  p  wormann op cit see n  p   carnovsky op cit see n  pp   i m z barkay israel library association report yad la kore june    in hebrew i m z barkay activities of the ila yad la korl march  blue pages   in hebrew
public library development in israel  and will help bring capable young men into the field conclusion this paper has stressed the several forces that had a role in the development of the israeli public library the link between library development and social conditions is generally acknowledged but one feels that in israel this was actually proved in a near laboratory condition the love of books is an ancient tradition of the jewish people but neither this love nor the existence of large collections of books brought the development of a public library movement books were accumulated but a library is more than merely a collection it has to be organized and to have the goal of serving a well defined community in order to become a library it was the need for social integration which triggered this movement in israel as in the united states in israel the need for social and cultural integration was more crystallized and the discomfort accompanying it more strongly felt being a very small nation and struggling for its nationhood and existence israel could not disregard any of its composing elements and tried not always successfully to develop a single nation with one culture perhaps pluralistic from the different groups forming it one is very much tempted to see the current development of public libraries as one of the mechanisms tried rightly or not for the raising of cultural standards and integration of all groups of israel society but mainly of what was called the second israel formed by israelis of afro asian stock that this was regarded as such is attested to by several addresses of the minister of education it was only after the feeling that not enough had been done penetrated the consciousness of the qualified public that the government and other public institutions made possible the expansion of libraries with all the shortcomings of the system mainly consisting of fragmenting and duplication of effort the public library has become more and more a reality felt in everyday israeli life  eban our culture at crossroads op cit see n
