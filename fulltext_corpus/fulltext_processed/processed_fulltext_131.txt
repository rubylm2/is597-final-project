librarians teachers and parents use professional reviews and awards to guide purchases and selection of books for children and young adults professional associations such as the american library association ala and the international reading association ira and state level affiliates have created book awards to distinguish the best of the best lists and awards recognizing high quality audiobooks for children and young adults however are relatively recent the odyssey book award inaugurated by the association of library service to children alsc and the young adult library services association yalsa both divisions of ala pays homage to homers ulysses and draws attention to the importance of the oral tradition burkey  this particular award exists to honor the best audiobook produced for children andor young adults available in english in the united states alsc and yalsa  numerous studies examining the qualities and characteristics of print texts reveal trends in the characteristics of the materials to which awards are conferred for example lenore j weitzman and colleagues  examination of award winning picture books uncovered a proclivity toward sex role stereotyping in childrens books and sandra hughes hassell and ernie j coxs  analysis of board books for young readers found very few characters of color or of diverse ethnic origin however jonathan lathey  found that protagonists in newbery winning books of the s display resiliency in contrast to those of the s and mara l houdyshell and coleen meyers martin  found that the female protagonists of newbery winning books from the late s through the late s are likely to display that resiliency audiobooks can also vary greatly in both content and quality in addition to the quality of the stories being told in their print counterparts audiobooks have added components in the production process to separate the poor from the average from the outstanding in fact professional reviews of audiobooks focus almost exclusively on the production components rather than the story or information conveyed mediatore  saricks  and awards are conferred based on production quality rather than story or information alsc and yalsa  audiobook production process narration to narrate an audiobook requires unique skills with one person typically giving voice to multiple characters tolkoff  narrators of childrens and young adult audiobooks must be able to voice the whimsy excitement and energy so outwardly apparent in youth burkey  the narrators tone voice and emphasis yokota and martinez  can enliven a story and engage a reader or do just the opposite saricks   a narrator must ensure that the voicing of a story does not interfere with the meaning thus it is particularly important that pronunciation of words be accurate and clear west  a narrators pacing expresses meaning pauses wittkower  and speed saricks  enhance the action and emotions of stories narration styles narration occurs in one of four styles the most common style employed is fully voiced in which each character is represented by a different voice in partially voiced narration the narrator uses distinguishable voices for the primary characters whereas the secondary characters typically share a common voice in the background multivoiced readings utilize multiple narrators with each representing a different character unvoiced readings are straight readings of the text without any distinguishable voices beavin  expressiveness of the reading high quality reading in face to face settings is typically characterized by the interactions that occur between reader and listener rather than the reading itself wasik and bond  a recent study mira and schwanenflugel  that measured expressiveness by changes in pitch using sophisticated specialized software found that expressive readings tend to be longer due to changes in prosody sound elements sound elements in the forms of sound effects and background music are often included in audiobooks like narrators use of speed and pauses background music affects pace and thus conveys meaning burkey  background music can establish the mood or set the level of intensity of a scene and it can emphasize the cultural significance of a text music is also used as transition between chapters andor discs and to signify the beginning and ending of the text myrick  final production steps final production entails four steps after recording is complete first all audio files are arranged in the correct order second the pacing is adjusted to remove long pauses and unwanted noises next the audio is compared to the written text to ensure one to one correspondence finally sound elements are added and the text is divided into tracks burkey  an average of  hours of production is required for each hour of an audiobook west  odyssey award criteria and selection process each year the odyssey award is given to the producer of the best english language audiobook for children andor young adults produced in the united states the odyssey award committee comprises a total of nine members although for the inaugural award the committee worked without a manual and with only modest guidelines vardell b  all committee processes are now guided by the odyssey award manual alsc and yalsa  which specifies award criteria and selection procedures the award is based on the technical aspects of production including the quality of the direction narration and engineering but not on the content of the book committee members evaluate the following production quality criteria  narration the narrator should be expressive dynamic use dialects correctly and consistently differentiate between characters speak clearly pace words appropriately and engage the listener  sound quality the recording should be free of unrelated distracting noise such as humming  background music and sound effects when used background music and sound effects should enhance the listening experience and fit the mood of the text throughout the year committee members listen to eligible audiobooks before the ala midwinter meeting they nominate titles to be included on the voting ballot and then meet in three closed sessions to vote on the award the committee also has the option of selecting honor titles if no production is deemed worthy an award does not have to be given the odyssey award and honor publications are announced at a press conference at the ala midwinter meeting and the award is presented at the ala annual conference alsc and yalsa  research purpose the dearth of research investigating audiobooks for children is astounding given the widespread endorsement of their use for children of all ages just as childrens reading performance differs according to the characteristics of the text read it is plausible that the effect of audiobooks on childrens literacy development varies according to components within the recordings thus a preliminary step in investigating audiobook use with typical and struggling readers is consideration of the factors constituting a high quality audiobook no research has yet examined the odyssey award or any other recommended audiobook lists to explore trends in high quality audiobook recordings the purpose of this study was to answer the question what are the typical characteristics of an award winning audiobook produced for children andor young adults methods through content analysis of all audiobooks distinguished by an odyssey award or honor designation this study aimed to quantitatively analyze and describe the characteristics of select audiobooks developed for children andor young adults that were subsequently awarded for their distinction data sources the sample for this study was all  texts that were recognized as odyssey award winner or honor title from the inauguration of the award through  when this study commenced ala  data analysis two researchers analyzed each of the audiobooks included in the sample for materials in read aloud format the researchers analyzed the packaging for published length listened to the audiobooks in their entirety and based pacing upon the total number of words and full running time for materials exclusively in audiobook format on multiple cds at a minimum the researchers analyzed the packaging for published length and listened to the first second and final tracks of the first cd the first and last tracks of all other cds and the last two tracks of the last cd for materials exclusively in audiobook format on a single mp cd at a minimum the researchers analyzed the packaging for published length and listened to the first second and final two tracks for all materials in audiobook format they randomly selected and listened to five one minute segments and based pacing upon the average number of words per segment the odyssey is based on the expressiveness consistency and clarity of the narration as well as production aspects such as addition of sound elements thus the analysis in this study considered those factors that could be operationalized and measured including characteristics of the narrator voicing of the narration pacing and inclusion and placement of music and additional sounds further the researchers considered the publisher characteristics of authors format of materials structure of the text and length of the recording other factors surrounding the recordings but separate from the productions themselves were also considered in this study books are typically characterized by subject and genre weisburg  and book selection by and for children is often driven by interest level in school based contexts designated reading levels of texts are also important selection factors and the reading level system employed in the common core state standards ngacpb and ccsso  which currently predominate in the united states is lexile metametrics  thus in addition to analyzing the materials themselves the researchers collected the following for each of the titles library of congress loc subject heading interest level reading level lexile and genre all based on the print format and recognition andor awards for all formats of the book the researchers then examined the loc subject headings and through open coding grouped the  assigned subject headings into general superset headings follis  to establish interrater reliability the researchers independently analyzed four randomly selected odyssey distinguished texts for all criteria except pacing the researchers were in agreement to measure agreement for the pacing a correlation coefficient was calculated using spearmans rho for each of the four novels r   results an average of five books receive an odyssey distinction each year and  n   of those have received other national awards or recognition for either the print or audiobookread along format publisher unlike most book awards which are conferred on either author or illustrator the odyssey award is presented to a producer as shown in table  listening library produced more than one third of the materials with odyssey distinction the majority of

characteristics of narrators and narration in only two instances  does the author serve as narrator as table  displays there is only one narrator in  n   of odyssey recordings this finding is not surprising considering that only certain titles lend themselves to more than one narrator males serve as narrator more frequently and two recordings have both male and female narrators the gender of the narrator matches that of the primary character in each novel with the exception of four recordings jazz which has no characters and alternates between one male and one female narrator dooby dooby moo and i stink which feature anthropomorphic and genderless animals or objects and skullduggery pleasant whose main character is a female yet the story is told from the male narrators perspective

characters but other characters voices are less distinguishable one recording does not have characters and although it has two narrators the reading is classified as unvoiced because each narrator delivers the text in a single voice reading pace as shown in table  average reading pace differs considerably between formats and a mann whitney u test confirms that differences are significant z   p   the average pace of honor productions is slightly faster than that of award productions but differences are not significant z   p   rather the variance seems to be a facet of having a higher percentage of read alouds in the award category than in the honor category the range of pace among the data set is quite large the book with the fastest average pace is read more than four times faster than that with the slowest average pace however within each production the pace of the reading corresponds with the mood and action of the text being read for example in the award winning read along jazz the introduction on the history of jazz is read at a much faster pace than the individual poems which are sung in rhythms reflecting the styles of the jazz described table   pace by format

all but four instances the music matches the theme culture andor era of the text and enhances the listening experience for example the music in skulduggery pleasant has sound elements embedded that are perfectly aligned with the text so that the sound element such as a crashing sound plays at the precise moment when a suspenseful event occurs thematic sound effects which are more often the exception than the rule are used more frequently in read alouds and placed sporadically to emphasize actions occurring within a book for example im dirty a read aloud about a backhoe includes a revving engine truck horn and crashing sounds the read aloud martina the beautiful cockroach a cuban folktale employs a cuban clave to signal page turns four other recordings also include sounds to direct page turns table   types of sound elements odyssey award odyssey honor total instrumental music    none    thematic sound effects    sound of page turning    table   placement of sound elements

was to answer the question what are the typical characteristics of award winning audiobooks produced for children andor young adults the odyssey award manual alsc and yalsa  purports that the award is based on high quality engineering and direction and for this study these terms were operationalized to include the quality of the narration sound effects and music as the results of this study demonstrate award recognized audiobooks for children vary greatly in a number of factors but based on means and modes a typical odyssey designated audiobook would be a fantasy or historical fiction novel about a white male character the audiobook would be intended for a young adult audience but the print counterpart would have been written on a fourth to fifth grade reading level the recording would be fully voiced by a male narrator with pacing at about  words per minute and instrumental music that matches the tone era andor subject matter placed at the beginning and conclusion the production would take slightly longer than  hours and the title would have received another recognition for either print or audio format does it really matter what difference does it make if an audiobook has two narrators or one if the pacing is fast or slow if sound elements are present librarians and educators should care about both the production elements and the content of audiobooks it is widely recognized that the quality and content of childrens and adolescents literature matters an abundance of professional literature in education and library science exists that promotes audiobooks for use with children and young adults this literature recommends using audiobooks to develop listening skills to encourage deep reading to support literacy development and to serve as reading motivation eg neuman  serafini  grover and hannegan  alhough research has repeatedly suggested using high quality texts to develop childrens and young adults literacy learning language and thinking skills fox and short  vardell a galda et al  studies exploring elements of quality in audio texts do not exist just as previous analyses of childrens literature reveal discrepancies so too does this studys analysis as in childrens literature in general eg perkins  hughes hassell and cox  this study reveals the lack of diversity found in characters of audiobooks this is particularly troubling given the potential of audiobooks to authenticate multicultural literature for young audiences yokota and martinez  given the percentage of award winning audiobooks that have garnered other recognitions for the print based counterparts the story or information of the audiobooks could be considered high quality and its not surprising that on the whole their subjects are similar to those of print based award winning books follis  interestingly although public school standards in the united states call for greater use of information text and higher reading levels of print materials ngacpb and ccsso  the majority of audiobooks available for children and adolescents are fictionalized accounts utilizing narrative text structures with reading levels trailing interest levels however the discrepancy between interest levels and reading levels could in fact lend credence to educators use of audiobooks as support for struggling readers given the importance of reading texts on an appropriate instructional level to support reading growth allington  coupled with the notion that reader interest is essential for engaged reading guthrie et al  audiobooks with high interest but low reading levels might be ideal for older struggling readers the results of this study reveal important areas for researchers to explore further this analysis demonstrates that most award winning audiobooks employ fully voiced reading styles with appropriate prosody however further analysis of the materials using sophisticated software to measure levels of expressiveness may be useful as a next step previous research suggests that the fast pacing of many audiobooks for younger children inhibits their ability to follow along with a print text while listening shany and biemiller  yet pacing is related to levels of expressiveness and thus comprehension mira and schwanenflugel  more studies are needed to investigate the relationship between audiobook pacing and older struggling readers in addition previous research demonstrates that individuals have preferences for different voice qualities hollien gelfer and carlson  yet how or if those voice qualities affect listeners comprehension is not known similarly background music affects both the comprehension and enjoyment of spoken messages carpentier  but exploration of the relationship of sound elements within audiobooks and subsequent comprehension by listeners is absent in the professional literature conclusion children and adolescents engage with audiobooks for enjoyment purposes but many educators and literacy proponents have also suggested that interacting rosenblatt  with audiobooks advances literacy development early childhood experts encourage parents to use audiobooks to develop reading and listening skills for young children neuman  and library and literacy scholars have endorsed the medium for advancing literacy skills for classroom use eg serafini  grover and hannegan  and as a tool for adolescents literacy development wolfson  moyer  with audiobook use among children and adolescents on the rise audiobook publishers association  and the availability of audiobooks for children and young adult readers more prevalent bowker  further research exploring audiobook use and reader outcomes is necessary this investigation of the components of high quality audiobooks pushes forward that line of inquiry
