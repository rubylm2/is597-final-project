inducing attitudinal change among librarians carol l kronus abstract using the semantic differential the attitudes of  public librarians participating in a training program on library service to the inner city were measured before and after the conference a group of  public librarians in similar positions in large cities was randomly selected and measured with the same instrument to serve as a basis of comparison and control three of the five concepts tested  community involvement in planning library programs the urban poor and library institutes as educational devices underwent statistically significant changes as a result of the five day institute comparing the post test scores of participants and the control group reveals that participants opinions of four of the five issues moved in the opposite direction from the views of their colleagues a discussion of two competing theories of why attitudes change in institute settings  interpersonal context versus ideational content follows with hypotheses for testing their relative influence educational institutes have different purposes ranging from dispensing information about new techniques and materials to altering opinions values and behavior of its trainees the kind of evaluation  its design and instruments  will vary with the specific purpose and scope of the training program however the common the author is a research assistant professor in the graduate school of library science at the university of illinois urbana 
attitudinal change goal of training programs is change in people  of attitudes of knowledge of awareness therefore the common objective of evaluative research is to provide a scientific assessment of whether the desired changes occurred as a result of the program the search for significant change is the guiding principal of this evaluation of a training program for public librarians from march  to   the institute for public library service to the inner city was held at the university at urbana the institute was advertised via professional journals and mailed leaflets to attract potential participants thirty five applicants most of whom were public librarians already committed to and involved in urban library programs were selected as understood by the evaluator the institute planners hoped to change the attitudes and views of the participants by a increasing their understanding of the nature and causes of urban social problems b increasing their awareness of the variety of alternative solutions c expanding their perception of the public library potential in helping to meet urban changes the strategy of this institute was to expose participants to a wide variety of controversial ideas media programs and people rather than trying to sell participants on a unified plan philosophy or activity the plan was to introduce realism variety and controversy into the program the institute group was exposed to five days of information ranging from academic reports of research studies reviews of personal library experience to reports of participants own programs representatives of both successful and unsuccessful library programs served as resource persons speakers with different points of view personal experiences and levels of optimism about the city future were invited to voice their ideas they included university professors high level library administrators and professional community organizers in addition to listening to others the institute participants saw films and gave talks the plan of this evaluation is to assess the effectiveness of the institute in accomplishing its goals what influence did this exposure to a variety of opinions information suggestions and themes have on the librarians how and in what direction were their opinions and concepts changed the instrument in order to assess changes in participants attitudes 
journal of education for librarianship and opinions a semi projective instrument the semantic differential was used to measure the meaning of the program central themes a positive stance toward the first concept community involvement in planning library programs was one of the few overt messages of the conference representing a liberal progressive attitude toward expanding the public role in making library decisions formerly made only by trained professionals this debate is similar to the current concern of college administration and faculty confronted by students who want more power in decision making store front libraries was included to assess participants attitudes toward a currently popular idea in urban libraries usually found in slum areas store front libraries are an attempt to bring existing library functions closer to the local residents by moving book collections from traditional sites to more accessible street locations the third concept the library potential role in serving the inner city serves as a measure of optimism and hope for the urban library future like other service institutions in the central city such as schools hospitals and welfare services public libraries face grave financial and social problems which threaten its existence in its current form since the urban poor are the people to be served by the library information about librarians attitudes toward them is extremely important finally we included the concept library institutes as educational devices to get information about the participants view of the value of this form of training the concept was worded to elicit attitudes toward the general method of communication rather than their evaluation of this particular training institute each respondent rated each of these concepts against nine semantic differential scales three scales good bad unsuccessful successful and beneficial harmful represented the evaluative dimension three softhard free constrained and powerless powerful for the potency factor and three fast slow cautious rash passive active for the activity dimension design a comparison of persons opinions and attitudes before and after the institute was deemed necessary to document any changes in their concepts and attitudes the semantic differential was sent to the  participating librarians and all participants returned the forms one month before the institute on the last day of the meetings they took the same test the difference 
attitudinal change between these two tests constitutes a measure of the effects of the institute on their opinions and ideas in addition a control group of public librarians closely resembling the sample group in position and city size was selected and measured using the american library directory we selected  library positions from  randomly selected cities with populations over  the librarians currently in these positions were sent the same instrument about one month before the institute twenty eight anonymous questionnaires were returned but one arrived too late to be included in addition one respondent had given copies to three of his librarians directly involved in an urban library project this added bonus contributed three more questionnaires for a combined response rate of  per cent we matched the positions of the control group with those of the participants whenever possible however many participants held newly created positions such as special programs coordinator  which were not listed in the directory in cases where matching was not possible an equal proportion of top and middle administrators versus branch librarians was randomly selected this control group serves as a comparison or benchmark to see whether participating librarians were significantly different from librarians who did not or could not attend this institute the background characteristics of the control and the institute groups are shown in table  the most obvious difference between the two groups is race understandably the topic of service to the inner city attracted a disproportionate number of blacks another difference between the two groups appeared in the recency of their library training although not reflected in their ages the institute librarians had received their professional training more recently than the control librarians fifty per cent had finished library school since i compared to  per cent of the control group finally there are differences in their library positions partly due to the effort to recruit action oriented librarians a larger proportion of the institute group  out of  had positions such as urban project directors or assistants and community coordinators top administrators were under represented in the institute group  per cent as compared with  per cent of the control group  there were no significant differences between the two groups in their sex age education or kind of training both groups were predominantly female  to  per cent under  years of age with masters degrees mostly in library science the participants over represented

attitudinal change blacks urban program librarians and recently trained persons clearly the institute attracted a special interest group within the occupation this selective composition of the institute group partially explains their stated interest in getting practical advice and actual solutions these librarians already have the interest in establishing innovative library programs so they want concrete programs suggestions and plans how does the institute group compare with the non institute group in their opinions before they attended the conference table  shows table  comparison between institute and control groups on total and component means institute control st measurement concept eval pot act x eval pot act   community involvement           store front libraries          library potential role in serving the inner city          the urban poor            library tih           the difference between the concept means or the control ana institute groups is signmcant ai u ìevei  significant at  level both the over all concept means and those of the three component dimensions evaluation potency and activity for the two groups of librarians the means can range between   extremely bad weak or inactive and  extremely good strong or active a mean score around  shows that the group felt that both adjectives were neutral or did not apply to the concept using the mann whitney u test significant differences were found in the over all meanings of two of the five concepts  community involvement and institutes as educational devices community involvement in planning library programs this concept was scored at about half of its maximum positive evaluation by both groups but the institute group w about  per cent higher 
journal of education for librarianship than control  to  on potency the control judged community involvement to be nearly neutral  while the institute group gave it a moderate rating of  or two and one half times the control rating it appears that this institute attracted librarians who already saw significant value in including local community members in planning library programs library institutes as educational devices both institute and noninstitute groups had equally favorable opinions of library institutes but they diverged on the other two dimensions librarians who attended the institute came with the view that institutes are a powerful and active means of education while the non institute group saw institutes as weaker and more passive it seems that having a favorable opinion of institutes is a necessary but not sufficient condition for attracting participants the deciding factor is the belief and expectation that attending these programs is a meaningful active step towards solving the library problems the meanings of the other three store front libraries libraries potential and urban poor connoted basically the same things for both groups summarizing the initial differences between the librarians who attended the training program and a control group of public librarians from similar sized cities who did not we find both background and attitudinal differences the institute attracted more blacks more recently trained professionals and more librarians in action  oriented positions the participants had a more positive attitude toward community participation on library affairs and the value of training institutes in helping them find solutions to the urban library problems table  shows the change in the meanings of the five concepts for the institute group by comparing their judgments made before and immediately after the institute the direction of the change is indicated by the sign  a plus sign means that the judgment on the post test was more favorable more potent or more active than in the pre test a negative sign means that the group judged the concept to be less favorable less powerful or less active after the institute than before the statistical significance level of the difference between first and second measurements d is shown within the parentheses as measured by the wilcoxin matched pairs test as in interpreting all significance levels the lower the figure the more statistically significant the difference the statistically significant changes are starred in the table

journal of education for librarianship librarf s potential role in serving the inner city two substantial shifts in opinion are noted after the institute the group saw the library role as more favorable and more active than before the meetings in view of the failures reported on and the controversies aired this growth of optimism is probably one of the most meaningful effects of the conference urban poor starting from a pre institute judgment of the urban poor as slightly good rather weak and passive after the conference the participants rated the urban poor to be more favorable stronger and more active this concept was one of the most susceptible to influence through institute activities library institutes as educational devices of all the concepts tested this one changed the most but in a negative direction after the conference the group felt that library institutes were somewhat less valuable less powerful and significantly less active a medium than they had thought earlier these changes can be interpreted either as a negative evaluation of this particular institute or a disenchantment with the general idea of talking about bad conditions and needed changes the first interpretation is doubtful for first special care was taken to phrase the concept to refer to the general notion of educational institutes and secondly participants responded to a more traditional evaluation of the institute with glowing praise and satisfaction another possible negative evaluation of this particular institute may be that participants failed to learn anything new that they had read or heard all this before thus as an educational experience this institute may have failed however it is more likely that the process of talking about and listening to others describe their attempts to set up new programs boomeranged in grasping the enormities of the economic political and social challenges ahead of the inner city library the participants probably realized how little talk contributed to solving these problems this interpretation is strengthened by the fact that the downward shift of the activity factor of this concept is the strongest change experienced by the institute group to summarize how the ideas and opinions of those who attended the institute changed we compared them with the control group as a benchmark table  contrasts the three group meansthe control group the institute group pre test and post test the institute group diverged from the non institute group in their judgments of the first four concepts two of these differences were statistically significant

journal of education for librarianship this evaluation asked what effect if any did this five day conference have on the people who attended it to answer this question we tested them before and after the institute and compared their responses with those of a control group of librarians from similar sized cities we found that the librarians recruited to this institute were somewhat different both in backgrounds and ideas as measured by the semantic differential test comparing the before and after scores of the institute group we found that the members underwent significant changes in the way they judged some central ideas in the institute three of the concepts  community involvement in planning library programs the urban poor and library institutes as educational devices were the subjects of significant opinion change as a result of the conference the participants rated the community role and the urban poor more positively than before the notion of library institutes as educational devices lost considerable appeal as a strong active means of social change over all the librarians who attended this institute returned home with some different ideas than they brought they also returned home even more different from librarian colleagues who did not attend the institute so the institute intensified some existing differences in perspective created new ones and ameliorated another the question of what actually caused these attitudinal changes is a moot one was it that this conference assembled a voluntary group of likeminded persons with common interests and commitment whose interaction influenced one another or did the training program with its barrage of ideas experiences and controversy produce the attitudinal changes the voluntary nature of the institute which is the norm among most professional retraining conferences proscribed the kind of research design necessary to answer this question in order to separate the effects of group interaction and persuasion from the training program the evaluator must be able to vary the group composition so he can compare attitude changes within a heterogeneous non voluntary group with those in a more homogeneous self selected group like this until this is done it is difficult for evaluation researchers to pinpoint the causal factors that operate in intensive educational institutes of this type the importance of this question is evident when one tries to estimate how long these new perspectives and opinions will last after participants return to their positions one could hypothesize that if the interpersonal factor is mainly responsible for producing opinion change in 
attitudinal change a conference setting then the changes will be relatively short lived once the reinforcing social context is dispersed the fact that such conferences tend to draw people with atypical attitudes and make them even more divergent from their colleagues implies that the reality shock upon returning will extinguish attitudinal shifts rather quickly the alternative hypothesis bodes more hope for longer lived effects of such training conferences if the attitudes of institute participants are changed predominantly by exposure to fresh ideas and perspectives as presented by speakers discussants and films then it seems that the participant will retain their new perspectives longer due to the fact that the participants have access to the ideational content through other media such as professional journals and publications these alternative sources of ideas and perspectives that are independent of the social context will reinforce the attitudinal changes after participants return to their positions the relative importance of the social context versus ideational content as change agents in conference situations is an important question which has implications for planning training conferences questions such as the type of participants to be recruited the relative emphasis on formal versus informal structure and the kinds of media to be used face all institute and program planners ideally their decisions should be based on the results of objective evaluation research notes  suchman e a evaluative research new york russell sage foundation   the conference was funded by us office of education grant  oeg    for the complete descriptive account of this program see the narrative evaluation of the institute for public library service to the inner city submitted to usoe by terence crowley director may   osgood e e suci g j and tannenbaum p the measurement of meaning urbana university of illinois press   siegel s non parametric statistics new york mcgraw hill  pp   since the institute group is a self selected thus non random sample non parametric statistics were used which are distribution free  siegel pp    osgood p
