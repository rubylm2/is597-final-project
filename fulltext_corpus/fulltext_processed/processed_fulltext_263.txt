negro library workers wallace van jackson tast september marked the beginning of hampton institute library school fourteenth year of service to negro alibrarians and to librarianship during these years many changes have been made in library service in the united states city and county library facilities have been increased throughout the country especially in the south a study of library service would probably show that one of the greater advances has been in extending the service of books to negroes and to residents of rural areas although a negro was graduated from a library school as long ago as ioo and since the early years of the twentieth century a few negroes have been employed in libraries in the united states the race had few workers in the field until the second decade of this century by  negroes had entered library work in such large numbers that the columbia civic library association a group of negro librarians in washington dc decided to publish a directory of negro graduates of accredited library schools as a result of the increasing importance of the negro librarian and the extension of library service to negroes in public and educational libraries the author felt that a study of the negro library workers was justified accordingly he sent questionnaires to oo negroes employed in library service in capacities other than janitorial the material collected relates only to paid workers in school and public libraries and is not concerned with nya or other student help the names of the persons to whom questionnaires were sent were taken from the dccredited secondary schools in the united i columbia civic library association directory of negro graduates of accredited library schools ioo t washington dc columbia civic library association

io the library quarterly summary and outlook although this study of negro library workers is incomplete sufficient information has been gathered to warrant some observations the writer believes that the facts show that more negroes are employed in library work in positions above that of janitor than is generally known in northern cities having large negro populations the public libraries are beginning to employ negroes in a few branches and in some cases in main library buildings checking the number of graduates from library schools against those employed in the profession has shown that most negroes who are qualified have found positions approximately  per cent of these graduates have been employed in library work since leaving school whether we consider the graduates of library schools or training classes the largest number of negroes received their training in so called negro schools although hampton institute library school was not opened until september i  students have completed courses there by january i the school had  living graduates with degrees or diplomas over ioo of whom were in positions in twentyone states chiefly in the south in the district of columbia and in the virgin islands about  per cent of these graduates were in college libraries i per cent in high school libraries i per cent in public libraries and a few in other positions of the  negroes who received training of any nature in library work  per cent studied at hampton i i per cent at columbia university  per cent at fisk university  per cent at atlanta university  per cent at prairie view state college  per cent at morehouse spelman summer school and  per cent at the university of illinois it is understood that the library training here considered includes degree diploma certificate courses and special work and that it is not a picture of the professional librarian but of the library worker undergraduate library degrees were received by  negroes from eleven library schools hampton leading with i or  per  accredited library school histories library journal lxii i
