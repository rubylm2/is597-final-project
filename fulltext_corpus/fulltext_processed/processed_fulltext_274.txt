childhood socialization its effect on adult library use and adult reading ronald r powell margaret t taylor and david l mcmillen this study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between certain childhood experiences and adult use of the public library and adult reading data were gathered via a nationally representative interview conducted by the survey research center of the university of michigan the interview contained  questions relating to current reading habits library use during the previous year and childhood experiences related to reading and library use for the respondent and the respondent parents in addition demographic data were obtained for the respondents on the basis of usable responses obtained from  persons  percent of the persons interviewed it was determined that heavy library users and readers were not unlike those characterized by earlier studies a substantial number of childhood variables did prove to have statistical relationships with reading and library use the results clearly indicated the importance of social learning and parents as primary agents in the development of reading and library habits introduction research to determine those factors that predict adult reading and library use has focused to date primarily on demographic variables and to a lesser extent on some sociological and psychological behaviors that exist in the user or nonuser as an adult however the area of social learning theory has produced a vast amount of research regarding the general importance of childhood socialization in determining adult attitudes values and behaviors as well as personality characteristics therefore a study was undertaken to examine the relative importance of childhood experiences in determining adult reading and library use a telephone survey conducted by the survey research center of the  school of library science  union drive university of michigan ann arbor michigan  library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved      
 the library quarterly university of michigan and based on a national sample of adults was used to collect data on present reading and library use behaviors present demographic variables and certain childhood experiences that might be related to reading and library use background research studies that have attempted to determine the factors that influence library use or specifically to determine the characteristics of library users as opposed to nonusers have provided information on the basic demographic characteristics of age sex education and varying somewhat from study to study income occupation race residence marital status and family size some have focused additionally on such sociological characteristics as reading behavior use of other media social and community participation or involvement political opinions and behavior and participation in or attitudes toward adult education activities and some on such library related characteristics as use of other than public libraries knowledge of and satisfaction with specific public library services and attitudes toward public library services rarely have these studies investigated psychological or personality characteristics that might relate to library use nor have they examined experiences attitudes or behavior from the usernonuser past that might relate to present library use the data from these studies have provided us with a reasonably consistent picture over the years of public library users and nonusers a few of these studies have been based on national samples or statewide samples but most have been based on individual city community or library systems four major studies of public library use based on national samples stand out from the past forty years campbell and metzger in   mendelsohn and wingerd in   and the gallup organization in   and again in   in  a major study on reading and book purchasing was done by yankelovich skelly and white  three other recent studies while not based on national samples focused on a broader range of characteristics attitudes and behaviors what their authors chose to refer to as life styles carpenter in   madden in   and bolton in   finally from the many useuser studies that have been done a few select studies should be noted because they made use of multivariate analysis techniques for looking at the effects of the variables rees and paisley study of information seeking and media use in fresno california in   kronus study of patterns of adult library use in illinois
childhood socialization effect  in   zweizig dissertation on factors predicting library use in syracuse new york in   and dlia study of public library user behavior in syracuse in the late s  in addition to the studies themselves there have been reviews of the studies one of the more recent of these analyses built on berelson classic the library public  is that of zweizig and dervin in   which includes among others data from the berelson review  and from the mendelsohn and wingerd  and the  gallup  studies as well as from the rees and paisley  kronus  and zweizig  multivariate analysis studies a third review to be noted that by harris and sodt in   adds the  gallup study  and the yankelovich skelly and white study  to the work done by zweizig and dervin  since these thorough reviews do exist for reference it seems reasonable to comment only briefly on the generalizations that can be and have been made on the basis of the findings however one comment should be made at this point regarding the methodological approaches of these studies two approaches have been identified by zweizig and dervin  pp   the variable by variable approach which looks at characteristics independently of each other and the composite characteristics approach which using multivariate data analysis techniques looks at all the characteristics or variables as they interrelate and allows the predictor variables to be ordered in relative importance and an additive model to be built the study to be reported on here also makes use of such multivariate techniques in general the results of these studies have shown that education is positively related to library use the more education the more use age is also clearly related to library use with younger people most likely to be users although this could be primarily an effect of education the effect of sex is less clear the  gallup study  showed heavier users more likely to be male but earlier studies have given females the edge higher socioeconomic status as determined by income and occupation is generally shown to be positively related to library use but since socioeconomic status is also strongly related to education its exact effect is not clear residence may cover such factors as how close one lives to a library distance from library has a negative effect on use the size of the city in which one lives the larger the city the greater the use urban versus rural environments the more urban the greater the use although the greater use in cities and urban environments may come about simply because these areas have more libraries or region of the country the  gallup study  showed residents of the east to be more likely to be heavy users marital status or family size does not seem to be related to library use although the  gallup study  showed
 the library quarterly that the presence of young children in the home had a positive effect on library use reading behavior and use of other media also correlate with library use library users are likely to be book readers although readers are not necessarily also library users and both book readers and library users are likely to be users of other media such as magazines newspapers television radio recordings et cetera both library users and book readers have also been shown to be active people involved in community andor social activities and often in community social or political leadership roles also correlating with library use as might be expected is the general role that print media and the awareness of and satisfaction with adult educational institutions of which the public library is one play in one life two psychological or personality factors that appear to be related to greater library use are achievement motivation and openmindedness the relative importance of these factors in predicting library use is measured against library use itself but studies have measured and interpreted use in varying ways zweizig and dervin stated that a public library administrator could be quite confident in concluding that on the average  percent of the adults use the public library once a month  p  they also cited figures showing that prior to  about   percent depending on the study of general population adults used the public library at least once a year  pp   the  gallup study reported that  percent of all respondents visited the public library at least once in the past year and  percent of all respondents visited the public library about once a month that is eleven or more times during the year  p  although studies have shown that public library use tends to drop off with age and particularly at the school leaving age no studies were found that attempted to relate past or childhood experiences in reading or library use to adult library use the campbell and metzger study in  did ask respondents if there was ever a time when they used the library more than at present and why it was or how it happened that they did not now use the library as much  pp   but the answers to these questions were not discussed in relation to present library use or to any of the other factors predicting use studies have been done on the use of libraries by children and on the place of the library in the child life as an example a recent publication on a major study of children lives outside school  interviews with elevenand twelve year old  see the  gallup study  and zweizig and dervin   see yankelovich skelly and white  zweizig and dervin  and berelson   see rees and paisley  kronus  and zweizig 
childhood socialization effect  children and their parents in oakland california reports children responses when asked about going places in the community of the activities specifically surveyed going to a restaurant the movies the park church and the library all were done by a majority of children but going to the library was the least frequently done only  percent of the children surveyed reported that they usually went to the library with their parents this study also examined what children did on their own including reading and found that parents helping children with schoolwork was directly associated with informal reading  pp  landy reported in   on research done on readers and nonreaders among seventh grade students in regina canada questionnaires psychological tests and in depth interviews were used to gather data and multivariate techniques were used in analyzing the data schools with the most readers and schools with the most nonreaders were visited and landy reported that surprisingly the school library did not make the difference rather it seemed to be the encouragement and enthusiasm that certain teachers had communicated to their students  p  both of these studies reported only on the child behavior however no studies on library use could be found that looked at the relative importance of childhood experiences in determining later adult reading and library use research from the area of social learning while not dealing specifically with library use and reading is concerned with the general importance of childhood socialization in determining adult attitudes values and behaviors  social learning theory predicts that many of our attitudes and behaviors will be shaped and influenced by the models we are exposed to and the actions we commit that are rewarded sometimes the rewards are explicitly stated in terms of contingencies for example if you do  i will let you  more often however the rewards come in the form of approval attention and affection parents are particularly important sources of reward to the young child because of the control they have and the child desire to be liked and to please the parents areas such as aggression prosocial behavior achievement and conformity have been studied extensively the general findings are quite clear persons who as adults are aggressive altruistic achieving or conforming usually develop these attitudes and behaviors as a result of learning experiences during childhood there are several reasons for this the major ones being  the relative ease of learning attitudes and behaviors when there are no preexisting attitudes or behaviors to compete and  the substantial control that parents have during this period regarding what the child is exposed to and rewarded for in addition
 the library quarterly there appears to exist in most children a general curiosity and eagerness to experience and learn unfortunately this curiositiy and eagerness is sometimes suppressed by parents and teachers so that as an adult the individual is less interested in learning according to albert bandura  and numerous others observational learning and instrumental learning are particularly important in the socialization of the child observational learning refers to situations where the child acquires an attitude value or behavior by seeing it exhibited in a model usually for the young child the parent is the model although television characters and teachers frequently serve as models early theorists for example miller and dollard  believed that for the child to learn from the model he must observe the model being rewarded for his behavior for example for a child to learn an aggressive behavior such as taking a toy from another child he must see the model being rewarded for such an action however bandura  has demonstrated that observation of reward is not essential for the child to learn instrumental learning does of course rely on reward parents and others shape the child attitudes and behaviors by rewarding the child with attention and affection for acting the way they desire the child to act both instrumental and observational learning are potentially applicable to developing reading and library habits in children a reasonable hypothesis is that children who are taken to the library by their parents and who observe their parents reading and using the library are likely to become adults who spend a substantial amount of time reading and using the library in addition children who receive attention affection and other kinds of rewards from parents teachers and others for reading and going to the library should be avid readers and library users as adults at least such a prediction follows from social learning theory the time at which such influences occur is likely to be of great importance preschool and grade school years should be of most importance as previously indicated this is the period when humans are most open to acquiring values and attitudes we are influenced by the rewards supplied by our parents and others also we tend to identify with significant adult models this identification causes us to want to be like and behave like those with whom we identify identification is particularly important because it means the child will try to emulate those he identifies with even if the person identified with is not present to observe or reward the child rather the child finds it rewarding to be like and act like the model as we become older we tend to identify with several different persons and groups however in early childhood the tendency is to identify predominantly with our parents therefore what we see in our parents determines a great deal of our behavior as children and later
childhood socialization effect  as adults how they behave is in a very real sense more important than how they tell us to behave applying this social learning model to reading and library use leads to a prediction that the adult who reads frequently and uses the library frequently probably began using the library regularly when in kindergarten or grades one through six probably was taken to the library regularly by one or both parents or some other adult and probably had parents who read frequently at home development of the study in order to collect adequate data regarding relationships between childhood experiences and public library use and reading it seemed necessary to conduct a survey toward that end a grant was applied for and received from the office of the vice president for research of the university of michigan this grant was provided for the purpose of financing data collection and analysis costs associated with the proposed survey the survey research center src of the university of michigan was contracted with for the collection of data via its monthly telephone interview this strategy offered several benefits it allowed the researchers to take advantage of shared field expenses it reduced the amount of time that was needed for developing new survey materials sampling and data collection procedures and it eliminated time required for questionnaire and code development for standard demographic items in addition src surveys are usually characterized by prompt turnaround within forty eight hours of the close of data collection a fully documented computer data file is available for analytic use an interview schedule was developed to collect data relevant to the question of the relationship between childhood experiences and subsequent adult use of the public library and reading habits keeping in mind the desirability of being able to make some comparisons between the findings of this study and those of previous studies on library use and reading patterns prior to the actual survey conducted in the summer of  the interview schedule was pretested twice by the staff of the src debriefings involving the research team the interviewers and an src supervisor were held following each pretest the pretests facilitated redesigning problem questions and determining the amount of time necessary for asking the questions which was the basis for the cost of the survey the final version of the schedule contained  questions requiring approximately three minutes of interview time per respondent as was
 the library quarterly indicated earlier it was incorporated with a larger survey conducted by the src this survey which was its monthly survey of consumer attitudes contained questions about personal finances employment price changes the national business situation et cetera in addition demographic data were obtained on income age sex race education and occupation among other things the library use researchers as is true for all researchers utilizing the survey of consumer attitudes had access to all of the data collected in the survey the src conducts an ongoing nationally representative survey based on approximately seven hundred telephone interviews per month with adult men and women living in households in the coterminous united states forty eight states and the district of columbia for each monthly sample an independent drawing of telephone numbers is made utilizing electronic random generation of numbers the respondents chosen in the drawing are reinterviewed six months later a rotating panel design results and the total sample for any one survey is normally made up of  percent new respondents and  percent of the respondents being interviewed for the second time the library use study however was limited to the new respondents a random sample of  persons in order to minimize costs and yet maximize the number of questions that could be asked usable responses were obtained from  persons or  percent of the total sample findings of the study profiles of the respondents the study respondents all of whom were eighteen years or older were distributed on most demographic variables about as expected they did not vary significantly from those reported in earlier studies as was indicated earlier the src made available to the researchers a variety of demographic type data not routinely gathered in library related surveys the demographic variables considered to be the most likely to relate to reading habits and library use and therefore included in the statistical analysis were income marital status political orientation employment status occupation years of schooling age race sex living environment number of children in household respondent perception of his or her financial status in comparison to the preceding year political party affiliation whether the respondent income had kept up with price increases size of the town where the respondent was residing labor union affiliation and geographical region in which the respondent was living as indicated data on reading habits were collected as well they too
childhood socialization effect  were not significantly different from comparable data reported in related studies about  percent of the respondents reported that they often read books  percent reported that they often read magazines libraries ranked third behind stores and family and friends as the major source of books regarding library use slightly over  percent of the respondents indicated that they had visited a public library during the preceding twelve months of those over  percent reported that they had used public libraries more than ten times during that period library users indicated that borrowing books represented their most common type of use by far of those who had not used a public library during the past year over  percent did report that they had used some other type of library during that time for more complete information on use variables see  in order to be able to analyze relationships between the library use and reading variables and childhood factors  questions designed to gather data about certain childhood experiences were included in the interview the questions and summaries of the responses are presented in table  as an examination of these data reveals most of the respondents as children had easy access to a library were frequent library users and were encouraged by their parents to read on the other hand less than half of the respondents actually read frequently as children or adults or had parents who had read frequently more than half of the respondents who had used a public library during the past twelve months reported having started to use libraries while in grade school the greatest percentage of them also reported that they had begun using libraries on their own if they were escorted to the library it was usually by a person they perceived to be a frequent library user analysis of relationships in order to investigate relationships between childhood experiences and reading habits and library use the data were statistically analyzed utilizing osiris a statistical analysis and data management software system in addition to the generation of univariate and bivariate frequencies osiris programs for x and multiple classification analysis mca were employed since it has been used extensively in library related research x probably needs no explanation here as is typically the case x was used because many of the variables measured in this study represented nominal level data in that x merely indicates whether a relationship exists between two variables a test known as cramer v was employed in order to measure the strength or degree of any relationships

childhood socialization effect  mca a technique for examining the interrelationships between several predictor variables and a dependent variable within the context of an additive model  p  was used in this study instead of multiple regression analysis because the mca technique can handle predictors with no better than nominal measurement and a dependent variable that is either interval scaled or dichotomous using mca permitted the determination of the combined effect of several predictor or independent variables on a dependent variable as well as the relative importance of the predictor variables mca also showed how each predictor related to the independent variable both before and after adjusting for the effects of other predictors reading as a dependent variable while data were collected on several reading variables the statistical analysis focused on two book reading frequency and magazine reading frequency looking first at the frequency of book reading it was found that five demographic variables had statistically significant relationships with the dependent variable that is x values significant at the  probability level or better the significant demographic predictors ranked in order of the size of their cramer v are as follows  sex x   p   v    political orientation x   p   v    education x   p   v    occupation x   p   v   and  marital status x   p   v   based on broad occupational categories those persons most likely to read books frequently were professional and technical workers they were followed in decreasing order by clerical and sales workers managers and operatives with regard to the other factors the most frequent book readers tended to be female to be somewhat to very liberal politically to hold a bachelor degree and to be a widow or single person it should be noted that while the preceding demographic variables were all significantly related to frequency of book reading when ranked with the childhood and library use variables they tended to be relatively low in importance in addition they had rather weak cramer v ranging from a low of  to a high out of a possible  of  however most of the cramer v values in this study tended to be fairly low as is often the case in social science research as for the frequency of reading magazines it was found that eight demographic variables were significantly related these variables were  education x   p   v    age x   p   v    income x   p    v     political orientation x   p    v     occupation x

childhood socialization effect  relationships were comparable to those involving the preceding demographic variables they ranged from  to  as for magazine reading frequency the statistically significant childhood variables were the same except that the availability of libraries in the home town was not related however the variable most strongly associated with adult magazine reading was whether the respondent was a frequent library user as a child while the frequency of childhood reading was most strongly related to adult book reading the measures of the strength of the associations were again rather low more so even than for the relationships between book reading and childhood factors the highest cramer v was  and the lowest was  as was indicated earlier mca was employed in order to determine the combined effects of more than one independent variable it enabled analysis of the effect of several demographic variables acting together several childhood variables acting together and combinations of the two types in evaluating the results of the mca particular attention was paid to the values obtained for q eta squared which was essentially the correlation between each independent and each dependent variable for beta which indicated the relative importance of each predictor variable in terms of variance explained after adjusting for the effects of other predictors and for multiple r or the multiple correlation coefficient which indicated the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by several independent variables acting together few  and beta values were found to be statistically significant only four variables produced values equal to or greater than  but the beta results did provide some interesting data regarding the relative importance of various predictors in addition the multiple r analysis produced some useful information about the effects resulting from combining certain variables and categories of variables for example returning to the respondents frequency of reading books it was found that among nineteen demographic and childhood variables the four variables having the most influence were the respondents childhood reading frequency their sex the person who accompanied them to the library as a child and whether their mothers or fathers frequently read the directions that these relationships took were indicated earlier in the discussion of the bivariate relationships or x results in terms of combined effect thirteen demographic variables were able to explain  percent of the variation in book reading frequency  they were in descending beta weight order education sex income residential setting party affiliation occupation political orientation town size marital status geographical region age race and children
 the library quarterly and six childhood variables acting together were able to explain  percent so in this case at least childhood factors were more powerful predictors of adult book reading frequency than were demographic characteristics less than half as many childhood predictors accounted for more than twice as much of the variation in the dependent variable as did the demographic predictors and in fact when these demographic and childhood variables were combined they were able to explain less of the total variation  percent than were the childhood variables alone in other words the demographic variables reduced the predictive ability of the childhood variables or the childhood variables were more influential when the demographic variables were controlled interestingly the results of the mca for magazine reading frequency were quite different according to the beta coefficients the four variables having the most relative influence on magazine reading were age political orientation political party affiliation and when the respondents first began using libraries a x analysis of these relationships was provided earlier but party affiliation was not included the two party preferences most frequently checked by frequent magazine readers were moderate republican and moderate democrat none of these four variables are among the four having the most influence on book reading the same groupings of demographic and childhood variables as were used with book reading frequency were regressed on frequency of reading magazines it was found that the thirteen demographic variables were able to explain  percent of the variation in magazine reading frequency the six childhood variables acting together were able to explain only  percent but in this case the combined explanatory power which was  percent was greater than the explanatory power of either the demographic or childhood variables alone in other words the predictive ability of either group was enhanced by the addition of the other but the combined or total predictive power was less here than it was for the same variables in relation to book reading frequency another interesting difference was that the relative importance of the demographic and childhood variables was reversed public library use as a dependent variable with regard to the statistical analysis reported here two variables will be considered indicative of public library use the first indicates whether the respondent used a public library during the preceding twelve  they were in descending beta weight order amount of reading as a child escort to library when library use began parent reading frequency library vailability and parent encouragement to read
