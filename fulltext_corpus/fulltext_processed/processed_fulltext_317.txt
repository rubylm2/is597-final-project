 the library quarterly there have been however many exceptions to this ideal quantitatively the most significant of these was the exclusion of millions of african americans from southern public libraries before the civil rights movement public libraries in the south developed in a pattern dictated by a segregated society public libraries were for whites only before the s except for the small understaffed and underfunded negro branches that operated in the urban south  for fiftyfive years black community groups worked within the context of racial segregation to improve library service for their race but by the mids they turned their attention toward desegregating the white public libraries the result was the read in movement that touched libraries throughout the south by  and that ultimately ended public library segregation at the same time public libraries came under attack from white segregationists who sought to ban books that contradicted the racial status quo the civil rights movement left public librarians in the south with a professional dilemma these individuals experienced a conflict of values that pitted the ethics of librarianship against southern racial mores the presence of library censorship and library segregation held a mirror to the profession and tested librarianship commitment to the values it professed to hold this professional dilemma was less intense for african american librarians since it was the white institutions rather than theirs that most required racial reform m but for both black and white librarians there were social economic and even physical dangers associated with open opposition to the prevailing racial order the civil rights movement became a key event in the evolution of librarians professional values but only recently has this important chapter in the history of librarianship begun to be addressed in the scholarly literature virginia lacy jones began a  article one phase of american library history that has been neglected is the struggle of the southern negro to secure public library service  p  thirty nine years later library historians can repeat this sentence with similar conviction events in alabama vividly portray the troubled relationship between librarianship and race during the movement years alabama was one of the most segregated southern states and it became a crucible in the  according to the southern regional council sixteen southern communities allowed full service for blacks in their main libraries in  and fifty nine did so in  most of these communities were in the border states between the north and south and had small african american populations  for additional information on african american librarians in alabama see

 the library quarterly designed to oust reed were in error retreating from his hard line position eddins argued that his actual concern was over the fact that a graduate of an alabama university could not meet the qualifications set for the library service post since it required an ala accredited masters degree in library science as a remedy the subcommittee offered an addition to the current rules so that a candidate with a masters degree in education majoring in library science would be an acceptable choice for the director position the compromise bill also gave the politically appointed executive board more authority over the director for its part the board agreed to take a more active role in supervising the creation of the library notes newsletter which had brought on the second phase of the controversy the board agreed that the newsletter would be prepared locally rather than offer any book recommendations by ala   p   the state legislature passed the library service compromise bill which left reed with her job the subcommittee and the state library board offered an upbeat statement describing the compromise asserting that libraries in alabama shall remain free and alabama is not afraid of freedom of information no books have been burned or banned in any state library in alabama  eddins hinted that the executive board of the state library agency might still fire reed however and he apparently hoped that it would the montgomery advertiser revealed that the director most vocal advocate on the board chairperson mrs j u reeves of mobile alabama would not be reappointed after her term expired at the end of september this news gave credence to the state senator insinuation that reed days in office were numbered but the board gave no indication that it had plans to remove its director  reed had weathered the controversy brought on by her commitment to the professional ethics of librarianship but she chose to leave the state only two months after the compromise bill went to the legislature the library service director was profoundly embarrassed that the state of alabama and her agency in particular had been portrayed in such a negative light in the press she had received newspaper clippings regarding the censorship controversy from as far away as london and paris reed believed that the entire affair had impeded the progress she had hoped to make in library development in alabama with few vocal supporters of her stand within the state or national library community to bolster her reed took a measure of the blame on herself for this perceived lack of progress in january  the library service director announced that she would relocate to washington dc she had accepted a position with the district of columbia public

 the library quarterly patrons from sitting together the staff would remove the chairs and store them in the library basement this change was intended to be a temporary measure to help the community to adjust to integration the staff would return the furniture as integration in the city progressed  the board voted to print new membership application cards requiring each applicant name address and length of residence in selma the application would also call for two references as an impediment to selma black citizens seeking use of their local library the effectiveness of such a form would be negligible but board members particularly heinz were irritated by the participation of outsiders in selma civil rights activity and they were looking for assurances that nonresident blacks would not interfere in the execution of their plans the board also voted to close the carnegie library during the week of may  may  officially the library was closed to take inventory  apparently the board wanted time to carry out their desegregation plan and to forestall any visits by blacks before the library could be integrated the moves toward biracial service were to be kept quiet neither the board nor the staff was to make announcements to the newspapers nor even to black leaders the librarian was uncomfortable with some of the terms of the plan particularly the removal of the library furniture but seeing the opportunity for peaceful desegregation of the library she felt compelled to compromise   the carnegie library reopened uneventfully on may   reverend ralph smeltzer visited the facility during the first days when it was still practicing vertical integration smeltzer was a white brethren preacher from chicago and southern california who came to selma in  hoping to open a dialogue between black and white leaders in the racially divided city smeltzer needed a place to write and went to the public library learning of the facility temporary lack of furniture he inquired about sitting in a corner or using a back room he noticed footstools and asked to sit on one a library worker eventually suggested that the minister sit at a low table in a corner where no one would see him smeltzer recounted in his journal that the library staff was helpful and apologetic the librarian explained the situation to smeltzer and he was surprised to learn that she seemed sympathetic to integration  p  selma librarian also believed that her staff should be integrated and soon after the board voted to desegregate the library she hired the city first african american library assistant annie molette had been the carnegie library maid for many years and she had quietly used her position to provide library service to a small number of black selmians from the carnegie building back door blalock told molette that the library would hire a new maid and that she wanted molette to begin doing actual library work and openly serving the public
civil rights era controversies  according to blalock her hiring of the african american maid as a library worker was designed to lay the groundwork for having some black employees  there was no rush of black patrons since the african american community was initially unaware of its new library privileges african americans were beginning to test the public facilities in selma however including its library and they slowly began to arrive by november black patrons were a common sight  p  blalock believed that overall the integration had been remarkably successful but it was not without its problems the white library staff members lacked enthusiasm for the changes their director was bringing in selma the integration and the promotion of their former maid they respected blalock but did not understand or agree with her racial views recognizing the discomfort of her employees the director began holding daily meetings in which the staff could discuss problems that arose during the day blalock hoped that her staff could air its grievances within the context of the meetings discussing the library problems around the bridge table she believed would only make matters worse  disgruntled white patrons sometimes openly expressed their disapproval of the carnegie library new policy on integration surprised over the presence of african americans in the library a white woman went into a tirade and she asserted that she would rather see the library closed than to endure integration  one of selma leading citizens entered the library in  and found black patrons reading at the tables and charging books he became incensed and demanded of the librarian what going on here dissatisfied with her response the white patron began making angry remarks to blacks using the library his performance continued until a policeman arrived and informed the irate man that he would have to move on  as integration progressed heinz and reynolds began to feel pressure from their constituents to reverse their decision regarding the library they were seasoned politicians who understood keenly the political dangers of the board actions heinz and reynolds began calling the city librarian in the evenings for updates on how the integration was progressing it was a particularly worrisome time for heinz who told blalock that he had received communications from white selmians urging that he either resegregate or close the carnegie library concerned about the mayor backsliding the librarian remembers suggesting to heinz that he lay the responsibility with her chris il tell you what to do just tell them i did it they can blame me tell them that you didn have anything to do with it  it was a difficult time for the city librarian she had to harden herself to the complaints of angry whites and to the disapproval of associates
 the library quarterly who did not share her views the crisis did not last long however and the reactions of some whites helped to affirm her commitment to integration in the library she describes one incident in which a patrona white man who she thought to be friendly and scholarly but also one of the worst racists in the worldcame into the library to find a line of blacks waiting to apply for library cards he turned to blalock and commented you know that not so bad she believed she had cleared a big hurdle by winning the man acceptance  another white patron demonstrated his opposition to integration by tearing up his library card and vowing never to return the librarian was heartened when the man arrived two weeks later to charge a book she presented him with the pieces of his old library card which she had clipped together and saved in case he returned  the voluntary integration of the carnegie library in selma by its board in  represented an anomaly in local race relations it is remarkable that a city that met civil rights marchers with clubs and cattle prods whose white community largely abandoned the public schools rather than endure integration and that had the state first and most active white citizens council would desegregate any of its public facilities in the absence of organized duress in may  however the members of the city library board two of whom were also the county leading segregationists quietly and peaceably integrated the public library at the insistence of the city librarian the board recognized that interracial service at the carnegie library did not represent as socially dangerous a situation as race mixing in schools or as threatening a proposition as equal voting rights but it also mattered that the white librarian was the individual pressing for change unmistakably southern in bearing manners and speech blalock was one of them she was a long time resident of the community a respected citizen and friend and though she did not share the board members racial views she understood how they were brought up  changing the library board membership policy at the insistence of a native white alabamian was more amenable to segregationists like heinz and reynolds and less politically damaging than integrating at the behest of black demonstrators outside agitators and federal judges blalock performance demonstrated that southern librarians could be effective agents of social change even in the most inhospitable political environments alabama library association library leaders organized the alabama library association alala on november   in montgomery its objectives were the pro

 the library quarterly the organization objectives it is false to operate under the constitution he wrote if we do not mean it covey argued that if the alala wanted to remain segregated let us say so otherwise the council should make a statement integrating the organization and stand behind it  earlier decisions to remain segregated rested on an argument that blacks could not be accommodated at conference hotels and meeting places on account of local segregation ordinances but covey contended that the actions of individual cities was not an excuse for alala to shun its own responsibilities he instructed council members to submit their votes on the tuskegee applications by mail covey was unable to get a quorum in his mail ballot there were four affirmative votes three votes against admitting the black librarians and four abstentions the remaining council members failed to reply one of the negative votes came from farris martin the montgomery librarian who grudgingly integrated his facility under federal injunction in  martin warned covey that with mobile integrated montgomery under injunction and birmingham under duress the racial climate was too dangerous to begin admitting blacks to the library association he believed that the ala access survey and the mississippi and louisiana chapters withdrawal from ala provided further evidence that covey timing was poor taking up the issue of desegregation of the membership might tear both the executive council and the whole alabama library association asunder  at the annual meeting the council voted to delay a decision on the tuskegee applications and to change the constitution so the association could officially deny membership to future applicants if it wished covey wrote to the tuskegee librarians explaining the council actions he asserted that he was not at all satisfied with the outcome and admitted that he was a little ashamed by the affair  in december  the alala finally desegregated the civil rights act passed earlier in the year made segregation in public accommodations illegal and the library association could no longer use its traditional excuse that segregation laws prevented biracial conventions also ala had applied pressure on associations like alabama forbidding its officers from participating in the activities of segregated organizations of more immediate importance to alabama association the federal government had begun to instruct its employees not to take part in organizations that excluded blacks this instruction meant the loss of the association current president maxwell air force base librarian robert w severance and several incoming council members   in a letter to the membership that appeared in alabama librarian
civil rights era controversies  the president explained the council decision to integrate he asserted that the association was  not engaged in attempting to solve racial prow lems and hoped that a minimum of publicity would accompany the change  emphasis in original the library associations in alabama and georgia had lost their chapter status in ala in  as a result of their refusal to desegregate severance added in his letter that alala would not immediately seek to rejoin ala even though the desegregation made it eligible for membership he explained that some members of alala were resentful of the actions ala had taken in regard to state library organizations in the south they opposed the application of force by outside agencies  the alala held its first integrated convention in mobile during the following spring freed to participate in the meeting by the state association decision to desegregate eric moon the controversial editor of libraiyjournal who favored integration delivered the principal address his speech the central fact of our times covered civil rights and the responsibilities of the library profession  the alabama librarian described the talk as well received adding you do not have to agree with the man to admire him  p  about forty african american librarians joined the association during the first two months of integration according to moon fifteen to twenty of them were in attendance at the convention and they were represented in just about all the meetings he asserted that there was not too much open mingling of the races but that the black librarians he talked to seemed generally pleased with the conference atmosphere and had experienced no significant problems  after a decade of banishment alala rejoined ala in july  the membership of the state library organization had approved the union  to  in a mail ballot the civil rights years had been tumultuous ones for librarianship in alabama but it was clear that its library association as a segregated organization was in no position to provide leadership in matters of race the group own internal struggle regarding membership provided evidence that the association reacted to rather than participated in the changes in race relations in alabama and the association had no observable influence on the events of library desegregation in fact after all of the state major cities had integrated their libraries the alala still excluded black librarians conclusion as a group alabama librarians exhibited no clear pattern of genuine support of library desegregation nor did they rush to the defense of
 the library quarterly reed during the rabbits wedding controversy black librarians were excluded from the decision making process and they could not exert measurable influence on white libraries in general white public librarians understood the volatility the subject of race engendered in the deep south and they sought to avert conflict in their institutions the state library association was consumed with a quiet debate over its own segregationist practices and it successfully avoided the issue of public library integration most white librarians in the state were moderates and largely apolitical they were neither fervent segregationists nor vocal supporters of civil rights their attitudes toward blacks were as varied and as difficult to explain as the complex relationships between white moderates and blacks in the general population their racial attitudes incorporated notions of paternalism but also of professional responsibility the civil rights movement was a time of anxiety for them but for some the fear of changing racial mores was acute ultimately it is easier to understand why many alabama librarians did not lead their libraries toward desegregation than to explain why some did professional ethics stood little chance against a tradition that overpowered white consciences democratic values and even christian teachings most who believed segregation wrong could not imagine actively opposing it for native southerners it meant questioning what they had been taught in school at church and at home challenging the natural order of things supporting integration meant allying with the enemy not the southern blacks but the hypocritical white outsiders it meant risking ostracism and possibly worse within their own profession and their own state alabama librarians saw in morgan and reed examples of what happened to individuals who challenged the agents of the massive resistance to desegregation the deeply ingrained racial attitudes of white southerners were becoming less impregnable by the s however and library directors responded to the changes in race relations blalock was a genuine integrationist who ended exclusions at selma carnegie library in advance of any civil rights demonstrations or federal intervention more common were individuals like guenter jensen of mobile covey of huntsville and fant thornley of birmingham who reacted to duress by black activists and to judicial pressure by leading their libraries toward integration they held moderate racial views and valued the wellbeing of their institutions more than racial separation but their actions demonstrated that the efforts of black protesters were ultimately more important to the cause of equal access to public libraries than the impulses of librarians on the state and national level to fulfill their professional values
