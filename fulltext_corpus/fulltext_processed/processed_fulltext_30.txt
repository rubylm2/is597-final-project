istigmatizing disability library classifications and the marking and marginalization of books about people with disabilities melissa adler jeffrey t huber and a tyler nix abstract libraries have historically organized materials about people with disabilities according to conventions created by medical and social scientific communities thereby reproducing dominant often pathologizing and marginalizing discourses about disabilities this paper focuses on libraries treatment of subjects related to physical disabilities by analyzing the national library of medicines medical subject headings library of congress subject headings the library of congress classification and the dewey decimal classification we use the lens of stigma as first theorized by erving goffman to reveal some of the processes and practices by which materials are relegated to the margins on the shelves and in the catalogthe cultural locations of disability help to begin a phase of historical reconstruction that demonstrates that our current approaches to disability are haunted by phantoms of the past in terms of both literal intellectual lines of descent and reactions to this heritage sharon l snyder and david t mitchell cultural locations of disabilityn their book cultural locations of disability sharon snyder and david mitchell  suggest that certain spaces designated for people with disabilities have actually existed at odds with the well being of the very people they are meant to serve describe or treat in their analysis of sites such as charity institutions research universities and popular films they explain some of the processes by which these locations have naturalized and institutionalized attitudes about interventions into and cultural norms surrounding the lives of people with disabilities they locate early discursive productions of disability in the united states in the eugenics movement which advanced policies based on the belief that society could be improved by identifying segregating and sterilizing people determined to be degenerate defective and unfit for reproduction snyder and mitchell argue that eugenicist discourseslibrary quarterly information community policy vol  no  pp    by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
  the library quarterlyof the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries continue to influence policy and practices regarding people with disabilities today and suggest that classification and documentation in state and medical agencies were key techniques by which eugenics was rationalized and institutionalized in this article we argue that libraries should be viewed as cultural locations that have participated in the marginalization of people with disabilities even as libraries have striven to serve them and that historical analysis of bibliographic classifications and subject headings demonstrates how discourses about disabilities have become systemic in our library subject access systems we do not aim to suggest solutions to the conditions we identify rather we wish to show that library classifications for works about disabilities were created in political and historical moments within social spaces and that the placement of books on the shelves provides important insights about libraries in the history of disability studies indeed there can be no fix to the classifications as preferences for organizing information about disabilities and people with disabilities will vary depending on perspective and discipline and terms and associations will surely continue to change over time our analysis begins with the classification of snyder and mitchells bookthe catalogingin publication data in the book provides hv as the library of congress classification lcc which is the class to which most research libraries that use lcc will assign the book hv is designated as people with disabilities and is hierarchically arranged within the social sciences as follows social pathology social and public welfare criminology protection assistance and relief special classes people with disabilities the placement of this book along with many other texts on disability in a special class within the section reserved for social pathology and welfare is anything but accidental and derives from historical associations with eugenics and dependency on the state as we will show library classifications mirror and support the classifications in the official and scientific documents of the periods in which they were produced in this article we examine the medical subject headings mesh the library of congress subject headings lcsh the lcc and the dewey decimal classification ddc to reveal some of the ways in which the organization of disability has relied on medical and sociological frameworks and how from the inception of these systems through the present library knowledge organization systems have reproduced normative discourses and assumptions that present people with disabilities as diseased andor dependent we offer a necessarily abridged and selective account of some of the processes by which such frames play out on the shelves we use the lens of stigma as first theorized by erving goffman to reveal some of the processes and prac
stigmatizing disability  tices by which materials are pushed to the margins on the shelves and in the catalog such an analysis positions libraries as cultural locations of disability as described by snyder and mitchell by revealing the library to be a site in which medical and state discourses have influenced the organization of a space where people obtain information about disabilities literature review and background setting the stage we devote a good deal of space to reviewing the literature as disability studies introduces relatively new concepts theories and challenges for knowledge organization questions this section is divided into three subsections we set the stage by situating libraries in a broader field of cultural locations that depict and serve people with disabilities next we focus specifically on the development of disabilities studies as an interdisciplinary field of inquiry and provide an overview of the concept of stigma then we review the literature on library services for people with disabilities the category of people with disabilities is extremely diverse disabilities can be highly visible or hidden and conceptions and degrees of impairment vary significantly across bodily social and cultural contexts knowledge and experiences of disability are historically socially and politically contingent library classifications however rely on and produce stability in ways that do not readily accommodate changing conceptualizations of disability the organization of subjects related to disability is embedded in a history of eugenicist ideals of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that organized bodies along lines of degeneracy dependency defect and monstrosity in contrast to an able bodied norm this division continues to structure our categories as we continue to organize disability along lines of normal and abnormal in the twenty first century library classifications are constructed on the basis of universalized norms and subjects that deviate from certain assumed norms are marked as special or other in many cases these were originally defined as abnormal deviant or defective we understand the social spaces in which library classifications have been produced to be part of a network of american cultural locations in which a normalabnormal divide has been naturalized over time film is a cultural production that illustrates our thesis as it visibly portrays related structural and discursive elements that can be tracked over time for example the movie freaks  and the fourth season of the fx television series american horror story  provide a point of comparison that shows how lines between normal and abnormal extend through time freaks featured individuals with a variety of physical abnormalities and disabilities specifically selected to portray a set of deformed sideshow performers although one of the directors stated purposes of the film was to humanize its characters it effec  tod browning freaks beverly hills metro goldwyn mayer  film brad falchuk ryan murphy freak show american horror story season  aired october  january   los angeles fx

stigmatizing disability  insights into the ways in which libraries reproduce dominant often marginalizing discourses about disabilities our analysis of each system begins with the earliest appearance of the concepts that we presently call disability or people with disabilitiesthe development of disability studies and stigma disability studies disability studies is among the critical interdisciplinary fields of inquiry that draw from the humanities and human experience to inform challenge and critique dominant frames of analysis derived from the medical scientific and sociological disciplines the critical interdisciplinary fields study sexuality gender race ethnicity class nation territory and indigeneity and foreground the intersectionality of subject positions while recognizing the ways in which these dimensions have been produced through various institutional contexts mechanisms and relations of power the destabilizing contributions of the interdisciplines pose specific challenges to library classifications which divide the bibliographic universe into discrete categories and hierarchies within the disciplines disabilities and people with disabilities have been classed in medicine according to disease or abnormality or in sociology within broad categories of social pathology or dependency even when the texts speak against those categorical associations library classifications highlight the ways in which categories structure disabilities and disability studies as well as the terms by which access to information by for and about people with disabilities is afforded disability studies and theory provide a theoretical lens through which to understand the role that language and categories play in perpetuating and dispelling dominant myths and attitudes that sometimes do harm disability studies works toward finding a way to turn societys gaze back on itself berger   as described by lennard davis  disability and related terms have been deployed in a variety of contexts by a range of disciplines to a range of effects in the medical sphere for example the concept has long been treated as a way to identify people according to biomedical conditions through the use of diagnosis and categorization this association contributes to a perception of people with disabilities as being ill and in need of a cure in the sociological context people with disabilities are frequently viewed as socially incapacitated and dependent on others or the state in recent years however people with disabilities have gained definitional control over concepts and issues and increasingly the term disability has come to denote a socialpolitical category often in resistance to medicalized perspectives on able bodiedness davis  suggests that the reclamation of such designations serves as a basis for unity and identity in political activism the  us census reported that  million people  of the noninstitutionalized population have a disability brault  reports that  million people over the age of  years need assistance with one or more activities of daily living as kathie snow points out not only
