what everybody talking about   e mail into the routine of their research practices many librarians also have access to the necessary hardware and networks and similarly participate in various forms of computer mediated communication those who responded to kovacs robinson and dixon online survey said that they spend an average of seven hours per week using e mail ninety percent of the respondents to cromer and johnson online survey said that they read libref l daily the special librarians surveyed online by ladner and tillman subscribe on average to more than three electronic bulletin boards or lists per person eighty seven percent of the respondents to neufeld online survey used e mail daily and  percent subscribed to three or more electronic discussion groups not all studies have found such a high level of use for example abbott study of email use by community college librarians nevertheless most studies indicate that librarians use of computermediated communication channels parallels that of scholars and scientists if the subscribers to an online discussion group are considered members of an invisible college it is obvious that the use of online networks as a communication medium may affect both the size of the group communicating about a particular topic or issue and the rate at which the idea diffuses among the group both of these effects were mentioned by the special librarians surveyed by ladner and tillman and are evident from even the most cursory examination of an ongoing electronic discussion group the size of the target group can range from hundreds to thousands and the receipt of a message is almost instantaneous allowing discussions to evolve quite rapidly such computer mediated communication is particularly critical for the conceptualization and clarification of ideas among members of an invisible college researchers state that news comments and advice placed on bulletin boards are valuable in generating new ideas and solving particular problems the trend toward vigorous online discussion of new ideas prior to their formal publication has led lincoln to suggest that individual development of important ideas may give way to group developed and refined scholarly ideas like researchers librarians also have used lists to solve particular problems these problems most often take the form of reference queries needing a response in addition librarians find that online discussions contribute to their professional development thus there are both immediate and long term motivations for librarians to participate in online discussions from the few studies cited above we can infer that librarians are active users of computer mediated communication and that they find it beneficial to their job performance and professional development an obvious next step in this line of research is to inquire regarding the topics that librarians discuss via online lists and newsgroups only one prior study of message content has been identified campana analyzed the content of the messages posted to mla l from may  through april  as one part of a study of written communication among music librarians she found that  percent of the messages discussed reference  percent cataloging  percent ml a activities  percent sound recordings  percent copyright  percent technology and  percent other topics the subject matter of messages posted to fourteen discussion lists and newsgroups related to information and library science was analyzed for the current study each message function  as distinct from its subject matter  is also of spring

what  everybody talking about   associations and appeared on all the lists comments made in the context of free wheeling discussions also were common on some of the lists but were rare on others this last finding is somewhat surprising when compared with the results from rosenbaum and snyder study of several non library science discussion groups on bitnet which indicated that the exchange of views on given topics was the most frequent type of message function one possible explanation of this difference is that librarians communicate differently than people in other fields another is that professionals use of computer mediated communication differs from that of scholars researchers one of the possible uses of the current study is to identify discussion groups for potential subscription based on the reader professional interests for instance if a reader is interested in censorship archives gay libn libadmin lm_net and soclibrariestalk might be considered for subscription such an interpretation of these results should be made with caution however each sample though reasonably large was taken from less than two months of activity on each discussion list additionally in most cases only one researcher participated in the categorization of the messages thus the reliability of the categorization can be questioned nevertheless these results present a starting point for understanding the subject matter of messages posted to discussion groups in information and library science and the functions being performed by those messages reflections on the research as an educational exercise as stated earlier this study was the result of a cooperative classroom assignment with two objectives to introduce new students to electronic discussion groups as a channel for professional communication and to introduce them to content analysis as a research method for the first purpose the assignment was certainly successful part of its success was due to student interest in the communication medium approximately two thirds of the class chose this assignment from among four term paper options available it is likely that their enthusiasm for the project was at least partially due to their interest in becoming more proficient in the use of computer mediated communication the informal comments of many of the students and the formal comments that appeared in their individual term papers indicated that they were also motivated by the desire to listen in on the conversations of their more senior colleagues this assignment gave them the opportunity to hear what the important issues are in various fields and how professionals deal with them in terms of fulfilling the second goal  introducing students to content analysis as a research method  the assignment was adequate but could be improved most of the student researchers had not conducted independent research before and it is unlikely that any of them had been involved in collaborative research though the assignment was to be completed individually there were some collaborative aspects to the project because it was determined early in the semester that the results from the individual studies would be consolidated a small amount of class time each week was devoted to discussion of the research methods being used sampling methods were discussed in detail the decision on a method for segmenting multiple topic messages was made jointly and the authority lists for topics and functions were derived interacspring 
  journal of education for library and information science tively in this way the assignment was successful one change that would both increase the learning involved with this project and improve the outcome would be to require the students to work in pairs by collaborating more closely with one other researcher the students could have learned about the importance of reliability in coding their topic and function categories and could have produced demonstrably reliable results in spite of this weakness we believe that the project was successful as a learning exercise and it will likely be incorporated in future offerings of the class conclusion this study has contributed significantly to our understanding of the topics being discussed by librarians in online messages and the functions being performed by those messages however we are still far from a complete and accurate picture of professional communication in this medium additional research studies should be conducted using a method similar to that used here they should sample from the same discussion groups at future times to see if the topics come and go or if they are stable within the group they also should sample from additional discussion groups so that a complete map of the subject matter of discussions in the field of library and information science can be charted a clearer understanding of the content of online discussions should support the formation of stronger and more useful invisible colleges thus leading to the clarification and rapid diffusion of important new ideas in library and information science references and notes  george s machovec usenet and listservs electronic news and conferencing information intelligence online libraries and microcomputers l gord nickerson networked resources computers in libraries     larry r oberg collib l listservs in library communications cfrrl news    avrà michelson and jeff rothenberg scholarly communication and information technology exploring the impact of changes in the research process on archives american archivist     mark j schaefermeyer and edward h sewell jr communicating by electronic mail american behavioral scientist    charles r mcclure ann p bishop philip doty and howard rosenbaum the national research and education network nren research and policy perspectives norwood nj ablex   starr roxanne hiltz online communities a case study of the office of the future norwood nj ablex   yitzhak berman discussion groups on the internet as sources of information the case of social work aslib proceedings    diane k kovacs kara l robinson and jeanne dixon scholarly e conferences on the academic networks how library and information science professionals use them journal of the american society for information science     donna e cromer and mary e johnson the impact of the internet on communication among reference librarians the reference librarian     sharyn j ladner and hope n tillman how special librarians really use the internet canadian library journal   sharyn j ladner and volume  number
