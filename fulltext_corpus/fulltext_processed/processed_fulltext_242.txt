interracial children books problems and progress paul cornelius abstract this article discusses why in the middle s many writers editors and publishers became keenly aware that racial minority groups were very inadequately represented in children books and considers some of what has happened in the past five years to redress this situation the following four aspects of these subjects are treated  factors which created interest in the problem of racial imbalance in children books with a brief history of racial attitudes in children books published since the s  conditions which until recently have impeded publication of interracial children books descriptions of several recent series publications for teen agers from minority groups and reviews of the activities of the council on interracial books  the recent black power movement in the world of children books and  an evaluation of four recent interracial children trade books about five and a half years ago many writers editors and publishers became more aware that racial minority groups were very inadequately represented in the world of children books this article discusses the sources of concern that developed in the mid s and some of what has happened in the past five years to redress this racial imbalance the problem can be illustrated by children books that were published then laurie and gregg characters in we live in the city a picture book for children published by the children press in  live in chicago but the book illustrations include no black people a little golden book called a visit to the zoo contains a detailed illustration of a scene at new york central park zoo but no dark faces are shown these are only two examples of a multitude which could be given to show that for a long time children books published in the united states paid little attention to the one eighth of the inhabitants of this country who are black the representation of black people has begun to improve but even in  only a few interracial children books were published in comparison with the total number issued in  nancy larrick in the allwhite world of children books showed how few books for black and other minority group children had been published describing the almost complete omission of negroes from books for children  p  she concluded that integration may be the law of the land but it certainly was not a common feature of children books to obtain evidence on the extent of racial bias in children books larrick surveyed the seventy book publisher members of the children book council who published trade books for children in   and  she found that the sixty three publishers who responded to her survey published  children trade books during those years but only  books or  percent included one or more black characters the percentage of books including figures of contemporary american blacks was in fact much lower than  percent because even this small proportion included blacks in books about such subjects as the 
interracial children books  carribean africa the boston tea party and jefferson davis her research disclosed that over the threeyear period only forty four four fifths of  percent children trade books from the sixty three publishers told a story about blacks in the contemporary united states twelve of these fortyfour books were simple picture books showing blacks in pictures but omitting them from the text in many books showing black people only tanned faces appeared sometimes in a crowd the delicate shadings of many of the tanned faces made it difficult to tell whether they were black or sunburned a number of the publishers surveyed had produced only all white books during the three year period the four most active publishers of children books during those years doubleday franklin watts macmillan and harper  row fared one third worse than the  percent average they put out  children books but only  percent of these books had blacks represented in text or illustration larrick pointed to improvement made in some interracial children books published over two decades she pointed out for example that the  winner of the caldecott medal award compared with the  winner showed great improvement in the portrayal of black children the  caldecott medal award was given to the rooster crows a book of american rhymes and jingles described by larrick as having four pages showing negro children with great buniony feet coal black skin and bulging eyes in the distance a dilapidated cabin with a black guntoting barefoot adult white children in this book are nothing less than cherubic with dainty little bare feet or well made shoes  p  in contrast the  caldecott medal award winner ezra jack keats the snowy day gives a sympathetic picture of a small black boy whose mother however a huge figure in a gaudy yellow plaid dress seems to resemble a traditional stereotype of a black woman she concluded that in spite of improvements consciously or unconsciously most writers and artists have long been following the formula for pure white books  p  one year after the publication of larrick article the treatment of racial minority groups in books for young persons again received considerable attention and publicity when the house of representatives committee on education and labor whose chairman was representative adam clayton powell held hearings on the treatment of racial minorities in textbooks and library books used in the nation public schools the committee tried to obtain information on   the role of the publishing industry in producing books suitable for the needs of the educationally disadvantaged low income and culturally deprived schoolchildren  the treatment of minority groups and their role in american society in the basic reading texts used in all schools  official school and library selection policies  the extent of expenditures under the elementary and secondary education act and other legislation supporting book purchases and  alleged price fixing of books by publishers and restriction of school and library purchases to certain editions with questionable binding cost and durability  p  persons from the publishing industry authors of children books educators school superintendents other school administrators and persons holding posts in state educational systems
 the library quarterly were invited to appear before the committee many witnesses testified that the treatment of racial minorities in books for young persons was distorted and had contributed greatly to misunderstanding and distrust between the races loretta barrett editor of doubleday zenith books a series of history texts for juveniles emphasizing the contributions minority groups have made to the making of the united states said zenith books were developed to aid the teaching of history of the united states not negro puerto rican or wasp history but us history the whole picture of the vital contributions various minority groups have made to our nation in its social cultural and political development i first became aware of this tremendous need when i was teaching history in a high school in north philadelphia whose school population was  per cent negro i found that almost without exception the textbooks from which i was assigned to teach history had either ignored or underplayed the role of america minorities in the building of our nation  pp   lerone bennett jr author and senior editor ebony magazine testified about textbooks the pattern of meaning we call education is not relevant to the lives of black americans who constitute the majority of the public school pupils in washington dc and a majority of the elementary school pupils in chicago and other cities education does not tell these students who they are and how they got that way it does not give them an image of their condition it does not corroborate their reality they do not live in the country described in the books the books the words the pictures are about another people who live in another country  p  dorothy sterling the author of children books commented about children trade books today    when we are in the midst of a civil rights revolution it is difficult to understand why so few books about minority groups are appearing a recent issue of publishers weekly lsts the children books to be published this fall from their descriptions only two or three are about negroes or puerto ricans  p   the larrick article and the house of representatives hearings in  were two major manifestations of a strong upsurge of interest in the treatment of racial minorities in books for young persons there were a number of reasons for this heightened interest first and perhaps most important on april   president johnson signed the  elementary and secondary education act of  when he signed the bill johnson said by this act we bridge the gap between helplessness and hope for more than  million educationally deprived children  p  the act gave financial aid  to schools having large numbers of children from lowincome families many of whom were of course from racial minority groups and provided for the purchase of textbooks and library materials  million  p  since the act was passed late in the   school year the first money dispensed under it arrived at many schools too late to be used for salaries of new faculty therefore in many instances it was used to purchase textbooks and library books when schools having many minoritygroup students tried to purchase interracial books with their new money however they discovered that much less interracial material existed than what they had hoped to find increasing pressures from these schools in  and t i am indebted to mr dan lacy senior vicepresident mcgraw hill book co for suggesting to me some of the ideas in this and later paragraphs
interracial children books   for more and better interracial books for young persons helped bring about the upsurge of interest in the treatment of minority groups in such books there were other reasons for the upsurge of interest the assassination of president kennedy who had defended the cause of blacks and other minority groups was a great blow to blacks and helped turn the civil rights movement which through  had been largely nonviolent into a more radical direction from  on polarization increased between the radical and moderate elements of the civil rights movement and between the black and white races the great harlem riot in the summer of  was the first major riot of a number of such which were to occur in northern cities in    and  in  and  violent racial conflict also increased in such southern states as alabama and mississippi the goldwater presidential campaign and the growing vietnamese conflict in  also helped to divide the country in several ways black versus white conservative versus liberal liberal versus radical prowar versus antiwar all these developments helped to bring about what began to look like a crisis in race relations a result was a reexamination of what racially speaking was wrong with children books many writers have contributed to this reexamination besides larrick article several other studies pointed out that at a very early age black children learn to feel inferior to white children and white children superior to black children in part because of attitudes communicated to them in the books they read one article said that the white child world of fantasy and fairies is a white world alice is white in the white wonderland a main symbol is the white rabbit snow white is of course white as are the dwarfs and rescuing prince  p  kenneth b clark prejudice and your child  showed that white children feel superior to black children not because of contact with black children but because they adopt prevailing attitudes that white adults hold about black people the kerner report produced evidence that our schools failure to present a positive picture of black people to students accounts for much of the hostility which exists between the races  p  other studies have concentrated on the long history of distorted racial attitudes in children books published in the united states an article published in  said that the representation of the negro in books for children has been since the beginning of the century only a fractured mirror of reality distorting negro life through stereotypes presented in the mass media  p  since developments in the world of children books in the middle and late s cannot be fully understood without a knowledge of this history i shall briefly summarize some of it here from  to  a spate of sentimental children books commonly called plantation stories about black twin children living on southern plantations before or after the civil war were published  p  the sets of twins in these stories were close relatives of the gold dust twins who used to appear on soap boxes in these two decades stories were also published about poor but happy as the stereotype demanded black people in the south be mrs johnson is quoting abraham f citron from a paper presented in 
 the library quarterly fore and after the civil war they were shown fishing playing pranks on one another having fun at the horse races and taking naps under shady trees these stories caricatured black people as shiftless joking unambitious and speaking a strange illiterate dialect  books written about black children during the first thirty years of the twentieth century generally did not reflect the great sociological changes that were taking place in black culture during those years for example the drastic changes in the lives of many black people who migrated from southern rural areas to northern cities  p  interracial children books written during those years were almost always written by white authors black authors who had written or who had ideas for children books were told by publishers that no market existed for books about black children  p  in the s some quality books for black children were published but they were only a miniscule portion of all the children books published world war ii called into question many long standing attitudes whites held about blacks and blacks about whites  p  the armed forces were racially segregated but the home front provided new opportunities for black and white people to get to know each other on a first hand basis when they worked side by side in industries which had been developed to aid the war effort  p  the new contact on the assembly lines and elsewhere on the home front provided members of both races with a new experiential basis for challenging and ultimately modifying traditional racial stereotypes longstanding attitudes about blacks and other minority groups were also challenged when americans found themselves confronted by the racist doctrines and the military might of nazi germany the war against the nazis and the issues it raised may in fact have been a major catalyst of the civil rights movement of the s and s and more generally of the great changes in racial attitudes which have occurred in this country since world war ii interracial children books published after the war reflected a number of new attitudes about race frequently having new themes stories and illustrations which more accurately represented black childhood experiences than books published earlier the supreme court decision in  that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional exercised a major influence on the publishing of children books this decision had of course farreaching effects on many aspects of american life and some children books published in the s reflected changes brought about by this decision they were concerned with segregation integration and making one way in a new sometimes hostile school environment among students who were members of another race  two black librarians who were especially active in the interracial children book field in the s as well as in the two previous decades were augusta baker now coordinator office of children services the new york public library and charlemae rollins now retired children librarian the chicago public library the bibliographies of interracial children books they published in the s and earlier drew attention to the best such books already published but they also showed a need for many more books  p  themes types of stories and illustrations continued to improve after
interracial children books   as children books by black authors and illustrators began to receive considerable attention blacks sometimes became consultants and editors and interracial children books were more frequently concerned with real life situations of black children still in spite of the progress as larrick showed in  the number of interracial books for black children was still pitiably small black authors illustrators and editors continued furthermore to be few and most interracial children books were still written illustrated and edited by whites until recently books about black children were poor business risks pressure from the south and other parts of the country frequently kept book clubs from selecting books about black children for their members sterling tells the following story about sales experiences with interracial children books in the s the same year that mary jane appeared  her book about a black girl first year in a school with many white students an acquaintance wrote a far less controversial book about a negro child visiting a white family for a fresh air fund vacation her book was already in galleys when the sales department heard about it they were so dead set against it that she was obliged to revise it transforming the negro youngster into a white one at still another publishing house an editor reports that during the  she brought out three books in which negroes appeared the books won favorable comment she said but the effect on sales was negative customers returned not only these titles but all stock from our company this meant an appreciable loss and tempered attitudes toward further use of negro children in illustrations and text  p  another passage from the same article shows that in the s the north as well as the south could give a difficult time to salesmen who tried to sell interracial children books at a cocktail party that fall     a salesman told me that although he liked some of my books he wouldn dare enter a bookstore in chicago with a book that had a picture of a negro on its jacket  p  salesman pressures on publishers were not however the only obstacles in the way of publishing books for black children another major difficulty persisting to this day is that black authors and editors who logically should be the major persons producing and distributing books about young black persons as well as encouraging their production and distribution are still very few indeed some persons in the interracial children book field say that even now the american publishing industry is doing little to cultivate black authors or put black editors into positions of greater responsibility the small number of black editors in positions of responsibility at american publishing houses is emphasized by many who have been concerned with the problem bradford chambers editor of interracial books for children the newspaper of the council on interracial books for children has told me that he knows of only one black editor who is editing children books a woman on the intermediate level who is editing an ethnic series for scholastic book service leigh dean of the juvenile book division of the mcgraw hill book company has told me that in the fall of  there were approximately  trade editors in the new york city publishing industry of whom three were black a recent time magazine situation report on black authors and editors said there are only four top level black editors in new york trade publishing probably fewer
 the library quarterly than  in the whole book publishing world in addition there are at least  small operations run completely by blacks most books on or by blacks being presented today are reprints this is especially true of black studies texts which are mainly reissues of earlier works of the new titles many are by white scholars who have moved into the new market in the whole book industry  new titles last year it is estimated that only  new books were actually by blacks trade houses report that from  to  of their books are now by or about blacks but one major and typical new york publisher noting that its output of black books has increased sharply reckoned the actual score at two new titles in  up to six in  these figures are not solely the result of discrimination the market for books among blacks is still small the educational market has been fed mainly with reprints and the popular market largely white remains satisfied with a handful of bestsellers  the market for books for young black persons may still be small but it has grown considerably in recent years the market has grown because children and teachers from racial minority groups who now frequently request interracial educational materials have increased considerably in numbers in recent years school decentralization programs such as those carried out in new york city public schools in the past few years have also stimulated the need for new improved interracial materials prepared by persons from several racial groups these developments call for an increase in the number of black editors and authors why are there not more black authors and editors some persons in the interracial book field say in answer to this question that only a few blacks currently receive the good education necessary for the writing and editing of children books unquestionably there is much truth to this view whitney young as director of the urban league must have had it in mind when he proposed a more than equal program in which employers would seek out and train for professional jobs blacks who had the innate ability for such employment but lacked the skills which should have been provided by a good education young has said that for more than three hundred years the white american has received preferential treatment over the negro and that what we ask now is that there be a deliberate and massive attempt to include the negro citizen in the mainstream of american life  p  sterling has asked editors to make a deliberate and massive effort to seek out negro writers and manuscripts with negro themes  p  chambers has another explanation of the shortage he charges that the children book publishing industry does not think that its best interests would be served by a more energetic effort to find black authors and editors therefore it is making no such effort to recruit them he calls this industry a last bastion of the white racist fantasies of the american middle class for the most part unwilling to change the stereotyped attitudes about race and society traditionally put into children books and which most white parents want to find in them the children book publishing industry loyalty to the white middle class he says is largely based on financial considerations it realizes that most white parents who buy children books are subconsciously committed to myths of white superiority and black inferiority and would probably stop buying children books if the industry made wide ranging changes in its racial attitudes frances keene former editor inchief for juvenile trade books the mac
interracial children books  millan company has also blamed the publishing industry for not making enough effort to provide more and better interracial materials for young people despite the changing picture in schools libraries and school libraries the juvenile editor meets continued reluctance on the part of the publishing management to embark on a consistent policy of providing interracial appeal in books for boys and girls resistance continues although the need is attested to by school and city librarians alike for example in such major cities as baltimore detroit and new york librarians report a great demand for books in two categories  teen age interracial fiction that deals honestly with contemporary problems  career stories that give a true picture of job training and of job opportunities for young people of different origins these needs are corroborated by city librarians in places where ethnic pressures are less mandatory and acute such as concord nh and hartford and clinton conn an initial print order of  copies for books in either of these two categories could easily be sold according to an estimate recently made by an informal group of juvenile editors however the purchasing committees of major publishing houses are slow to respond to this manifest reality of the current market nor have they by any means fully met the demand for picture books with interracial illustrations and for fiction aimed at the middle age group in which characters from different ethnic groups are shown in real situations to implement the editor awareness of the demand for integrated books and for books that will interest children of different economic levels support is needed from reviewers librarians teachers and social workers  p  interracial series despite such problems many publishing houses have put out in recent years increasing numbers of interracial books for young people some of high quality several series publications in particular have been successful in instructing teen agers from minority groups and other series currently beginning publication also stand a good chance to be successful the following discussion is only a sampling of some of the more outstanding recent series and is not a full description of all the work being done in this field one of the first series of books for young persons of minority groups was the zenith books series begun by doubleday in  this series which is concerned with the history and biographies of blacks and other minority groups from colonial times to  was begun by charles harris a black editor to provide interesting educational reading material for young persons of minority groups each zenith book is written by a black or other minoritygroup historian in collaboration with a children book author the books published in inexpensive paperback form are written on a sixth grade reading level but their content parallels many sixthto twelfth grade social studies and english courses the publisher says that zenith books are designed to encourage the slow the bored the inhibited student toward greater participation in class at the same time their use will give all students a more balanced picture of american growth and development based on the achievements of america minority citizens  some of the books published so far in this very successful series are agnes mccarthy and lawrence reddick worth fighting for  a history of the negro in the united states during the civil war and reconstruction carol drisko and edgar toppin the unfinished march  the story of the negro in the united states reconstruction to world or further consideration of this subject see the editorial in the autumn  issue of interracial books for children

interracial children books  campaign was to lay the base for a revolutionary movement that will unite black    and white radicals  p  something like a black power movement has recently developed in the world of children books some blacks are now saying that because white authors have never known how it feels to be black their writings necessarily distort the experience of being black and that only interracial children books by black authors can accurately describe how it feels to be a black child several black authors have indeed begun to put militant racial views into their children books black and white authors who disagree with these views say that white authors can write books about the black childhood experience if they have enough imagination and empathy two recent books for young readers about black people which illustrate this controversy are sounder    by william h armstrong who is white and black folk tales  by julius lester who is black the case of sounder armstrong says that his moving story of a poor black southern sharecropper his wife eldest son three younger children and courageous coon dog sounder was told to him fifty years ago by a gray haired black schoolteacher from the south who taught him in a one room negro school because of his great poverty the sharecropper was forced to steal food for his family the sheriff and his two deputies arrested him for this crime at his cabin brutally mistreated him and were taking him away to jail in a wagon when sounder enraged at seeing his master being hit by strangers escaped the eldest boy grasp and chased the wagon as he leaped at the wagon one of the deputies shot him in the head wounding him severely sounder lay in the road for a long time but later he made his way back to the sharecropper cabin secluded himself under it for a long time and then disappeared into the woods for weeks no one knew whether he was dead or alive then one day he returned from the woods the living skeleton of his former self the wounds in his head and one of his feet having somehow healed themselves sounder took up watch near the cabin waiting for his master to come home when the eldest boy and his mother found that the father lhad been sentenced to hard labor and removed from the local jail they tried without success to learn whether he had been sent to one of the many road camps which moved around the state or to a prison farm or to a road quarry each year in the fall when work in the fields was finished the boy made long searches on foot for his father but he did not find him on his wanderings around the state he met a schoolteacher who befriended and educated him the boy stayed at the teacher cabin in the winter where he did chores which paid for his schooling and in the summer he worked at home in the fields when he came home sounder hobbled down the road to meet him one hot summer day a number of years after the father had been taken away a lone figure appeared on the horizon sounder who had not barked or been animated since he was hurt and his master had gone began barking loudly when the figure got closer the boy saw that it was his father and that he was very crippled he had been severely injured in an avalanche of limestone in a prison quarry in the

interracial children books  ings schwartz says the sharecroppers would have looked very much like members of the black panther party who are not afraid to express their rage at society schwartz gives several examples to show that the members of the black sharecropper family are the inhibited fearful negro stereotypes found in older literature but that sounder shows much rage the sharecropper for example does not resist the sheriff when he is arrested stick out your hands boy ordered the second man the boy started to raise his hands but the man was already reaching over the stove snapping handcuffs on the outstretched wrists of his father   pp      sounder on the other hand shows tremendous rage towards the sheriff and his deputies the wagon taking the father away to jail started and the sheriff rode behind it on his horse sounder made a great lunge forward and the boy fell against the corner of the porch sounder raced after the wagon no one yelled after him the mother stood still in the doorway the deputy who wasn holding the reins turned on the seat aimed his shotgun at the dog jumping at the side of the wagon and fired sounder fell in the road and the sheriff rode around him sounder master was still on his back in the wagon but he did not raise his head to look back  p  schwartz gives examples of how the oldest boy fails to express his anger only one of which i shall mention here on one of his long journeys in search of his father the boy waited outside the iron fence of a road camp he leaned against the fence and hooked his fingers around its wires suddenly something crashed against the fence in front of the boy face a jagged piece of iron tore open the skin and crushed the fingers of one of his hands against the fence lost in thought and watching the convicts the boy had not seen the guard who had been sitting under a tree with a shotgun across his knees get up and come to a toolbox filled with picks and crowbars which stood near the fence  pp   the guard laughed but none of the convicts looked up the boy knew that his father was not among them for his father would have attacked the guard then the guard threw the scrap of iron toward the boy but the boy showed no anger it landed a few feet from the boy he looked at the iron and he looked at the man the white spot between his hair and his eyes was the spot the iron would split it open with a wide gash and blood would darken the white spot and make it the color of the man sunburned face and the stone that david slung struck goliath on his forehead and he fell on his face on the ground the boy thought but he left the iron on the ground  p  besides believing that armstrong is unable to let his black characters express their angry feelings schwartz has other objections to the book he believes that it teaches the american white man traditional doctrine largely irrelevant to the plight of many black people in the united states that hard work patience and study bring success it also seems to teach an attitude that whites say black people had in earlier times when they had no chance to improve their lot that men should not aggressively try to change unfortunate conditions but instead should resign themselves to them abiding by the lord will maybe he the teacher will write letters to the road camp for you the mother said  ause youl soon be so busy with schoolin and cleanin the schoolhouse for him that you can go searchin no more maybe i have time the boy said but he says like you etter not to go just be patient and time will pass
 the library quarterly it all powerful puzzlin and aggravatin but it the lord will the mother said  p  schwartz also says that armstrong did not adequately explain how the sharecropper family supported itself after the father was arrested an oversight which indicates that he does not have much appreciation of the anguish of poverty black folk tales if sounder does not in the view of some critics contain a truthful account of the black man experience what kind of book does probably many who share schwartz views on sounder would agree that julius lester recently published book for young people black folk tales gives such an account julius lester columnist folk singer photographer and radio personality is the author of the  newbery medal runner up to be a slave and several other successful books including revolutionary notes and look out whitey black power gon get your mama his views resemble those of the black panther party in that he believes that the oppressed peoples in the united states should ready themselves for revolution  and that in view of what the black man has suffered at the hands of the white man over the centuries he is justified in feeling and expressing hatred toward the white man discussing a course he taught to black teen agers in the south several years ago lester has said there was a girl in my class whose brother was the first black child to integrate a high school and what did she decide to write about in her composition her first dance i had to push those kids to write about their own experiences and their own feelings and once they got these out the results were unbelievable they have to learn that whatever they feel whatever they write is going to be acceptable and if they say to themselves  feel hate they have to express this too  p  lester has put many passages expressing hatred of whites in his black folk tales many children book authors teachers and librarians of both the black and white races disagree with lester contending that children of any race may be harmed by books containing race hatred augusta baker coordinator office of children services the new york public library who is black has refused to allow black folk tales into the new york public library children book collection for this reason her decision must have been a painful one to make since a number of the stories in black folk tales contain no passages of race hatred alid since all the stories have considerable literary value lester says that the stories in this book come from the black people of africa and afro america   p viii the stories which in some cases exist in many forms and are many centuries old derive from oral traditions in africa the pre civil war south and american cities lester has probably invented some of thie passages expressing hatred of whitey since he has retold all the stories in his own style other passages however he must not have invented since the main theme of some of the tales handed down from generation to generation is such hatred passages attacking white people in black folk tales are not difficult to find the first paragraph of the last story in the collection keep on stepping reads you know white folks are something else always been like they are now just don want to let a nigger be a man somehow they figure if you become a man they ain one
interracial children books  no longer  p  other tales in the collection such as stagolee high john the conquerer and the beautiful story how god made the butterflies contain passages expressing animosity towards whites it would probably be easy to make too much of the politicization of current racial issues found in some recent children books and in comments on them several of the attitudes just discussed in all likelihood derive more from a feeling of proprietary right which some black authors and illustrators now have about trade books for young black persons than from a deep seated urge to inject themes of racial conflict and hatred into such books on anything like a grand scale although there will certainly be continued evolution of racial attitudes in children books there will probably not be in them greatly increased politicization of racial issues like that just discussed since most black as well as white parents are probably against giving books containing racial attitudes like those in black folk tales to their children still it is worth pointing out that for whatever the reason some recent interracial children books and comments on them reflect such politicization of course as has been pointed out previously undesirable racial attitudes have pervaded white children books from time immemorial interracial trade books of high quality good interracial children books need not have for their theme the irremediable antagonism between the black and white races without minimizing current racial problems they can help the races to overcome the problems left to them by a tragic past by deepening understanding of what it means to be black or white in the final section of this article i have somewhat randomly selected for discussion four good trade books two for young children and two for teen agers which illustrate some of the best work currently being done in the field of interracial children books each book is a solid contribution to the growing list of good interracial children books published in recent years one of the best interracial books for young children recently published is stevie  by john steptoe who is under twenty years old brooklyn born and black stevie is the story of a little boy named robert an only child who lives with his parents in the big city perhaps brooklyn new york one day robert mother tells him that a little boy whose mother has to work is coming to live with him during the week the little boy name is stevie and as soon as he moves in robert discovers that he has mixed feelings about him he likes playing with stevie but he is also jealous and does not want to share the spotlight with him when robert comes home from school he finds that stevie who is not yet school age has been playing with his toys robert reaction i wished his mother would bring somma his toys over here to break up elsewhere robert says about stevie and on saturdays when his mother comes to pick him up he always tries to act cute just cause his mother is there one saturday stevie mother and father say that they are going to move away and that stevie is not going to come back any more after stevie is gone robert finds that he misses his little playmate he remembers how they played cowboys and indians on
