urbanizing america  she has had no instruction in or practice at dealing with negro women who are the wives of insurance executives who make ten times as much money as she does rapid social change such as that in american race relations poses various problems for different people i also interviewed about three years ago in alabama a poor rural uneducated southern negro he provides a model of what social scientists mean when they use the term role conflict this man grew up in a different world a related one but a different one from that of the department store clerk he grew up in a world where there were two rules for survival don make the white people mad if in doubt ask the minister having learned that two basic rules are  don irritate the white man and  lean on the minister for advice that negro man goes to church sunday morning and hears the minister tell him it is your duty as a good american citizen and as a christian to do the following things which are going to irritate white people go out there and protest go and demand your rights stand in line to register to vote the minister is telling him to do these things the poor man knows only two rules and they are coming into direct conflict social change is very hard on people because some of the rules they have learned no longer count but they cannot always tell which ones they should abandon yet research also demonstrates that there is one way to mediate the threat reduce anxiety and overcome much human resistance to social change unlike the experimenters white rats human beings are able to learn to anticipate coping with situations they have not lived through they are able in other words to understand change if it is explained to them they can be told something you have never experienced before is going to happen and here what it will be like and they can mentally practice coping with it before it happens therefore they do not have to lie down at the beginning of the maze the key lies in understanding the solution is to remove people from the category of the frustrated white rat by explaining what is happening and why it is occurring many studies in industrial sociology conclude that new policies and work patterns can be established with minimum personal insecurity and maximum ease of adjustment to change if people are told what is happening and why the changing shape of the american class structure not only the composition of the labor force but also its distribution among various occupational statuses have changed markedly in the past few generations at the time our country was founded farming was the most important income producing activity of the people and as recently as  more than half the labor force was engaged in agriculture today farmers comprise only  per cent of the labor force the major industrial change in the last century has been from the production of goods to the production of services at the turn of the century about three fourths of the people in the labor force were engaged in producing physical goods and fewer than one fourth provided services by  the majority of the people in the labor force worked in service occupations these figures include employers and the self
 the library quarterly employed as well as wage earners and salaried workers this large scale shift in the distribution of the labor force has been brought about largely by technological improvements machines wash dishes dig ditches and even measure and make corrections in the quality of production by other machines heavy manual labor has given way to machine production which has freed a larger portion of the labor force for work in service industries it is not simply that automation has taken over many of the tasks formerly performed by human hands in manufacturing agriculture too has become more and more mechanized there were  fewer farms in the united states in  than in  despite the fact that there are now fewer farms than at any time since  these farms are able through mechanization to supply a considerably greater population than could a larger number of smaller farms in   per cent of all americans at work were doing farm jobs today only  per cent of our labor force works on farms and these workers are able to produce surpluses the trend toward mechanization of agriculture and manufacturing has meant that a larger and larger segment of the labor force is available to run laundromats rent out evening clothes provide package delivery services be tree surgeons or public stenographers in short to enter service industries this change in the industrial structure from production to service is accompanied of course by a change in the occupational distribution of the labor force the most dramatic growth has occurred in semiskilled labor and the clerical occupations the most striking decline is in the unskilled segment of the labor force the increase in clerical and professional personnel is a corollary of the expansion of services most of the people in both these categories are providing services since  clerical workers in the labor force have increased fivefold professional and technical workers threefold sales workers nearly twofold and proprietors and managers by almost one half during the same period household workers declined  per cent but other service workers like barbers beauticians cooks firemen janitors policemen and waitresses have doubled in general the proportions in service occupations have increased by a third the nation economy then is less and less dependent on muscle power and more and more dependent on professional technical and clerical skills the shift from brawn and manpower to education and brainpower summarizes a basic trend in american economic life the growth of semiskilled labor at the expense of the unskilled is a function of two changes in the industrial structure first of course was the development of machinery that enables one semiskilled worker to perform the task formerly accomplished by several unskilled laborers one crane operator for example can replace twenty men pushing wheelbarrows the other change that helped to speed the mechanization of industry was the success of the labor union movement during the past three decades which has made labor more expensive and thus has made it more profitable for example to hire one man and purchase a machine than to use three men and save the cost of the machine certainly the industrial revolution has brought drastic changes in production and consumption patterns with
