library and information studies faculty in canada a sex ratio study hope olson and toni samek this study looks at the sex ratio of women to men and related factors among library and information studies faculty in canada by profiling  and  for comparison the twenty year span is intended to reflect the impact of feminism the advent of automation two year master programs lis doctoral programs the  accreditation standards and faculty turnover primary sources of information are the  directory issue of journal of education for librarianship and the  directory issue of journal of education for library and information science as well as library school catalogs the sample comprises the entire population of full time faculty in the seven currently accredited programs academic rank doctorates held and areas of teaching specialization are explored to identify differences between women and men the findings indicate that the canadian sex ratio which is the reverse of the figures for north america in general was the same in  as in  however women and men have become more evenly distributed by rank and by area of teaching specialization recommendations for future research include a qualitative look at what influence sex ratio of lis faculty has on students faculty are key participants in determining education for library and information studies lis in canada laurent g denis noted that they virtually control the entrance to the profession an important factor in lis faculty influence on lis students and practitioners is that of potential role models a survey done at the school of library and information studies university of wisconsin madison found statistical evidence that female role models have a greater influence on women students than do male role models comments from respondents indicated that the students intended to follow in the footsteps of their role models a recent work by mary niles maack and joanne passet has drawn attention to the importance of women mentors in the academic environment of library and information science are there enough women faculty to go around the sex ratio of lis students is quite different from that of lis faculty in accredited programs in north america the percentage of women to men enrolled in accredited master programs from  to  was  percent women and  percent men but the ratio of lis faculty in  was  percent women to  percent men in the fall of  over a decade later the ratio for students was  percent spring

 journal of education for library and information science liamson reports on library education of  and   then the recommendation was made that library schools be moved from the public library setting where faculties were predominantly female to the patriarchal university model there were at least two assumptions at play first the shift from vocation to profession would lend librarianship more prestige in this respect roma harris points out that university based education is a defining characteristic of a profession and that education as status is particularly controversial for the feminized professions second with the shift from vocational to professional university based education the sex ratio of library school faculties would shift mary niles maack suggests that these changes had a negative impact on the status of women faculty the studies mentioned below lend credence to this suggestion as they illustrate how schools are most interested in hiring in the area of information a predominantly male specialization concentrations of women and men in different specializations can have an impact on the sex ratio in hiring heim surveyed deans and directors of accredited lis programs in  and found that they were most interested in hiring faculty in order of preference in information science information resources management children services and public libraries james d ramer philip m turner and j gordon coleman studied whether candidates for positions were more likely to approach employers or whether deans or directors were more likely to approach possible candidates they found no difference on the basis of sex but did find that people specializing in information science were more likely to be sought out than other specializations these results mesh with heim  finding that information science was the most wanted specialization and coincide with the addition of the word information to the names of library schools while demands for different specializations may change these two studies indicate that specialization is an important factor certain areas have been found to be predominantly female or predominantly male in a number of previous studies in the major study done of lis faculty in north america women were found to predominate in cataloging and children young adults and school librarianship while men predominated in information science automation research methods and the history of books printing and libraries in that study roma harris gillian micheli and carol cooley chose five benchmark years from  to  while the mix varied somewhat the differential among the above mentioned specializations was fairly constant many more studies have looked at specializations among lis students and practitioners that confirm these links between sex and specialization a canadian study of ontario librarians a subset of group b was done in  by kenneth plate and jacob siegel it not only shows largely similar results but combines students and practitioners by looking at specializations in library school courses taken and in first and second professional jobs held the one difference from studies considering all of north america is that in plate and siegel findings women are not as concentrated in cataloging as with the previously mentioned factors little work has been done recently in canada so exploration is overdue historic context this study examines the sex ratio of women to men and the related factors of academic rank doctorates held and teaching specializations among lis facvolume  number

  journal of education for library and information science two year master by all seven programs between  and  one effect might have been a greater interest and activity by faculty in their specializations as a result of teaching more courses beyond the introductory level bringing about a greater orientation toward research and contributing to the increased demand for doctorates lis doctorates became more available to canadians with the establishment of programs at the university of toronto in  and the university of western ontario in   as both of these programs began to produce phd in the mid s the availability of canadian programs may have enhanced the level of doctorates held by lis faculty in canada though it must be remembered that many lis faculty have doctorates in other relevant fields accreditation a further factor reflecting and reinforcing the climate of equality prevailing in the early s was the antidiscrimination statement introduced in the  standards for accreditation of the american library association committee on accreditation which accredits canadian as well as us programs it reads discrimination because of age race color creed religion physical disability or sex in recruitment admissions or financial aid or in appointment promotion or pay of faculty and support staff shall be a violation of these standards these standards were in effect from the beginning of the period that we are considering in this study turnover a further reason for our selection of this twenty year span was the likelihood of a turnover sufficient for reflection of a change in hiring patterns in the event there was indeed a turnover of approximately  percent only eighteen faculty members were included in both the eighty two full time lis faculty in canada in  and the eighty in   collection of data the main sources of data for this study were the directory issues for  of the journal of education for librarianship and for  of the journal of education for library and information science as well as library school calendars or catalogs and the alise library and information science education statistical reports the directory issues were chosen because of the availability of relatively compatible data in the directories for the benchmark years chosen and because studies of lis faculty often use these directories allowing for future comparison of results in particular harris micheli and cooley and clare beghtol used the directories in their studies of specializations and noted that with  library automation and data processing became a category thus confirming our use ofthat year as a benchmark the library school calendars were used as supplementary sources of information our sample is the entire population of full time faculty in the seven currently accredited programs part time faculty were not included because their status varies considerably from one university to another also the program at the university of ottawa was excluded from the  statistics because it closed in  shortcomings of these data sources were the omission of specializations for some faculty particularly from the  directory and the lack of availability of information regarding doctoral degrees held by faculty at some volume  number

 journal of education for library and information science result of a balancing of factors such as the impact of feminism on the field and on universities the rise of automation the two year master programs maturation of faculty increased access to doctoral programs and antidiscrimination as a factor in accreditation changes in rank show a possible stabilization with more even distribution of women and men within ranks the same seems to be true for doctorates held and for at least some areas of specialization automation and children young adults and school librarianship being the exceptions an interpretation requiring only moderate optimism puts lis faculty in canada well on the way toward a  sex ratio in all respects however caution suggests that further research is needed to draw conclusions in an area of such complexity recommendations for future research several possible avenues for future research have presented themselves in this study three of them are fundamental questions first why are there more female than male lis faculty in canada when the reverse is true in overall north american statistics second why is there so little change in teaching specialization in children young adults and school librarianship third and most basic what influence does the sex ratio of lis faculty have on lis students research literature in this area of lis might benefit from the importation of research from other fields regarding mentoring and gender imported concepts might help answer questions such as does the sex ratio of faculty affect specialization ambition research potential completion of the program do rank and status contribute to the effectiveness of role models has a more even distribution of women and men among most teaching areas changed patterns of specialization among students any of these questions would also benefit from analysis of american influence on aspects of canadian education for lis or canadian influence on the united states such as the two year master programs other more specific questions also arise in what teaching specializations has there been turnover and why are women who specialize in research methods recent phd why was cataloging and classification evenly divided in  in canada when it has been predominantly female in other places and recently in canada does this change show an increase in us influence on canadian librarianship two other categories for future research come from factors outside of but related to this study the first parttime and other faculty is of particular importance since this category is likely to expand given the trend toward fewer tenure track positions in canadian universities four questions arise regarding this group is there a difference in sex between part time faculty who are practitioners as well and those who are exclusively part time faculty how rapidly do people move in and out of this group and is turnover related to sex in a given situation who are full time other and who are part time how does this situation vary between universities the second area that is related to but outside of our study is that of sex differences in terms of tenure the alise statistics indicate that in  far more male than female assistant professors already had tenure because different universities make different links between rank and tenure statistics alone cannot reveal clearly the situations this data might indicate all of these possibilities for future research are unlikely to be satisfied volume  number
