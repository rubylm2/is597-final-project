visual research into lis student group work using the draw and write technique  thematic analysis group work means working together face to face twenty six of the isquares feature group members working collaboratively face to face using tables or desks as a focus of the group activity in some isquares eg  below see figure  the drawing simply depicts one meeting however in others the face to face meeting is represented in the context of other group work activities as in isquare  see figure  which show a series of meetings interspersed with individual work communication and ideas generation are often specifically labelled in these drawings of meetings with either speech bubbles or thought clouds and with lines linking members with each other figure  isquare  figure  isquare  the tools to support collaboration are an important aspect of group work it is evident from the isquares that students use a variety of technological and non technology based tools to support and facilitate their group work in isquare  see figure  we can see a detailed depiction of hardware software and even power supply people are not represented figure  isquare  figure  isquare  figure  isquare 
 mckinney cook in isquare  see figure  similar consideration is given to the need for power for devices in the collaborative space but here people meeting as a group constitute the central image books and writing implements can be seen an indication that the group work is not conceived solely as being mediated by technology in isquare  see figure  we can see a dynamic representation of a group meeting likely taking place in a dedicated bookable group meeting space typical of libraries and learning centres where students are making use of a whiteboard to frame and share their ideas in total four isquares contain whiteboards group work is a process and involves a set of distinct phases nineteen isquares depict group work as a series of defined stages where groups meet work individually and then come together to share progress and exchange ideas in these phases there is often a process of information searching gathering and sharing as shown in isquare  see figure  in isquare  figure  different locations including the home are shown and while the whole group is shown communicating face to face we can also see two members communicating by phone figure  isquare  figure  isquare  in isquare  see figure  the student is explicit about the fact that the group task is sub divided into individual tasks that are worked on separately and there is a subsequent process of rationalizing and integrating information the student recognizes the potential for disagreement in this process there is some evidence of the tuckman  stages of forming norming storming and performing but more emphasis is given to tasks rather than to the interpersonal aspect of the stages of group work the different activities that take place at certain stages in the group process are shown for example defining the task assigning tasks to members having a meeting sharing information and progress dispersing to work further and coming together to create the final product leadership is important and groups can have hierarchical structures twenty six isquares contain drawings of a leader and often these are represented in a type of hierarchical structure reminiscent of an organisation chart
visual research into lis student group work using the draw and write technique  or organogram as seen in isquare  see figure  in some isquares the leader is represented with a little crown demoting their status and authority in the group is depicted delegating specific tasks to individual members or defines the timeline of the group activity as in isquare  see figure  figure  isquare  figure  isquare  some labels on drawings indicate that the group leader is responsible for defining the timetable of the group work and is in charge of synthesizing information found by other members the leader seems to be analogous to the belbin team role of coordinator someone who delegates roles in the team combined with implementer someone who plans a strategy and ensures it is carried out other depictions of the leader are more egalitarian with the leader represented in a circle or sitting at the same table as the other members of the group members and the leader are shown as having defined responsibilities commensurate with their abilities skills and experiences which although quite different are equally valued as in isquare  see figure  figure  isquare  figure  isquare 
 mckinney cook it is not possible to see the full range of the belbin team roles represented in the isquares and often the activities represented in the isquares could be assigned to one of the belbin role descriptions but not to an individual in the team more often the action of resource investigator is carried out by more than one member of the group often all members are depicted contributing to the shared output as in isquare  see f igure  rather than this being the role of a completer finisher group work is about connecting with others twenty three isquares were identified as expressing overtly positive representations of group work and many of these showed hands or group members connecting with each other by holding hands isquare  see f igure  even where students do not have a positive perception of group work they are shown united in their unhappiness isquare  see figure  figure  isquare  figure  isquare  group work is about generating ideas a commonly used image seen in five isquares is a lightbulb used to represent the generation of ideas and the positive experience of working together see eg isquare  in figure  and isquare  in figure  figure  isquare  figure  isquare

 mckinney cook group work is stressful it is a negative experience apart from free riding a number of other isquares present a negative view of group work in isquare  see figure  the tension between the positive framing of group work by academic staff and the stress and time management problems experienced by students is powerfully depicted communication problems experienced in multicultural groups is the theme of isquare  see figure  figure  isquare  figure  isquare  free riding is a problem with groups at university eight isquares contain drawings that showed free riding or the unequal contribution of group members in isquare  see figure  we can see a classic image of free riding where four group members are having a meeting and a fifth group member is depicted as being at home in bed and is labelled lazy however free riding does not necessarily involve absence sometimes it is represented as non engagement in a meeting a more metaphorical view of free riding can be seen in isquare  see f igure  where the relative contributions of group members are weighed on a scale indicating the injustice felt by students who have a group member who does not contribute as much as they might in isquare  see figure  multicultural tensions around free riding are revealed by the student who created this drawing in which one group member is asleep at the table while another is reading a book labelled not p articipatinglistening each group member has been given a nationality figure  isquare  figure  isquare  figure  isquare 
visual research into lis student group work using the draw and write technique  in summary a very diverse range of images have been used to represent group work from very literal drawings that show actual people working in groups to drawings that show processes and activities and structures to very abstract and metaphorical representations of group work this diversity is explored in relation to the existing literature on group work below discussion conceptions of group work a strength of collecting drawn data is that it allows participants to express concepts through metaphors weber  mitchell  and it is possible to see a variety of metaphorical representations of group work in this data set group work is holding hands and connecting with others and these mages represent positive conceptions of group work that are echoed in the literature around the perceived benefits of group work cartney  rouse  johnson  johnson  groups are represented as being strong through working collaboratively toward a shared goal and this corresponds to a chinese proverb only when all contribute their firewood can they build up a strong fire clark  baker  group work is a puzzle and a process that involves people and activities fitting together in complex ways and aspects of models of group roles and functioning eg belbin  tuckman  can be seen in the data group work is about generating ideas and developing shared understandings some of these graphical forms eg lightbulbs trees are similar to those evidenced in hartel  savolainen  and reflect popular culture images imprinted during childhood however this does not negate the interpretations that can be drawn from these images the metaphorical conceptions of group work seen in these drawings offer a qualitatively different representation of group work from research using more traditional data collection methods although it would be possible for these methods to make some of these conceptions clear too they give educators insight into the different ways in which students experience and view group work which has implications for how we support groups and give positive points of discussion with students about how they view group work how students work together it is possible to see evidence of successful cooperative groups as defined by johnson and johnson    in the drawn data the interconnectedness of groups and the working toward shared goals of characteristic of positive interdependence are evident in the lines connecting group members activities and outputs and in the images of holding hands it is possible to see the value that students place on face to face meetings as promotive interaction by the large number  of drawings of meetings previous research has also underlined the importance of the meeting as an integral aspect of group work hassanien 
 mckinney cook the student group with a hierarchical structure with a clearly defined leader came through strongly in the drawn data despite the problems discovered with group leadership in previous research cartney  rouse  many drawings reflect a more organization like team structure mirroring how team structures are presented using diagrams in the workplace the concept of a group leader was common in the data gathered from modules with high numbers of chinese students and this could be due to their preference for groups to have a defined leader as discussed in previous research chan  clark  baker  as noted above the full range of belbin team roles is not evident in the drawings but there is evidence that members take on different roles in the group and that this is an organized and successful process gagnon  roberge  the conception that group work is a process with defined steps of meeting information searching and individual working and producing is not present in the literature included in the review many drawings show a non linear process a complex interweaving of people and activities and this reflects both the difficulty inherent in explaining exactly how a group works together and the complexity faced by students when they attempt to manage working together the forming storming norming and performing stages of group work tuckman  are represented in the data but often we see only one stage per drawing for example just the storming is represented through an image of group disagreement the drawings that do depict stages of group work tend to show successful group functioning and focus more on the different types of activity for example the stages of meeting communicating discovering resources and producing artefacts the technological tools that students use to facilitate their collaborative work are represented in detail and this mirrors previous research that has demonstrated the vital role played by modern communication technology in general and specifically in lis education mckinney  sen  nortcliffe  middleton  positive and negative aspects of group work the connection between discussions and learning askell williams  lawson  is well represented in the drawings students are clearly aware of the need both for effective communication and to work together face to face meetings generate the ideas and lightbulb moments that are shown in the drawings some researchers identify that meeting and working together face to face has advantages over dividing the task and working separately mayne  while a good number of drawings do show these face to face meetings many also show task division this is a more pragmatic view of group work in that groups cannot accomplish every task while being in the same place but it also shows a flexible and dynamic way of working therefore while meetings are an essential aspect of group work it is important to acknowledge that they are not the whole story
visual research into lis student group work using the draw and write technique  communication represented metaphorically with lines and connectors and more overtly with speech bubbles and words is an important aspect of group work seen in the drawings where communication goes well the group work is a positive experience where there are communication difficulties particularly where group members speak different languages or have different cultural backgrounds this is problematic for group functioning when groups dont function well we can see evidence of the stress and frustration found in previous research volet  mansfield  free riding is a problem for groups since it causes much resentment and labels of laziness that potentially may not be justified freeman  greenacre  in these data a cultural element to p erceived free riding is seen with group members of particular nationalities singled out for censure it is important in lis courses featuring large numbers of international students that educators acknowledge culturally diverse attitudes to group work and seek to support students through open discussion of roles expectations communication preferences and language issues asgari  conclusion this data set reveals student views of group work that are different from those revealed through previous research offering new insights into how students work together models of group work have focussed on the stages of group work and the roles of group members but these are not necessarily the only features of student group work in particular the structure of student groups and how students have represent the different processes of group work provide novel insights into group work in higher education the interactions with each other and with information sources and technologies shown in these drawings show a complex and hard to manage experience of working together experienced by these lis students the use of visual methods to explore student perceptions of group work offers the opportunity to contribute a differently nuanced understanding of what it is like to work in groups dean  by leaving the framing deliberately open a more idealized view of group work was invited and this may have facilitated some of the more abstract and metaphorical representations of group work present in the data set the drawings have been used to support student groups in the i nformation school student groups were presented with a selection of drawings and were invited to discuss their meaning in the initial stages of a group task this enabled groups to open up discussions with each other about how they plan and manage their group work and enabled group members to be open about their preferences it also facilitated discussion in multicultural groups about the culturally different ways in which students from different nationalities experience group work which supported group cohesion these kinds of discussions if facilitated by educators can
