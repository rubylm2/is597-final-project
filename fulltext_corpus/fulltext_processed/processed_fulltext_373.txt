eleanor weir welch  tained a woman will still usually have to accept something less than men because of the consideration which she exacts and deserves on account of her sex  p  putnam proposed that women were limited by some prejudice in favor of that other sex if this exists it can only be due to convictions based on observation and experience he exhorted women to adopt manliness the absence of which causes women to be peevish toward the smaller ills and a sense of proportion to develop the inventive faculty to show initiative and to be dynamic  p  women were portrayed as natural children librarians but unnatural administrators women librarians who have been chronicled in the traditional historical literature luminaries such as katharine sharp isadore mudge and linda eastman sometimes are viewed as exceptional women able by some massive effort to overcome the innate female weaknesses and excel despite themselves but what of those women not in the vanguard of the library profession are they unknown because they could not overcome the deficits brought by their sex or were they too successful in their own right with work lesser known but still worthy and useful the example of a little known figure eleanor weir welch who was a librarian for forty two years from  to  documents the professional life of a woman who though not famous was nonetheless a person of achievement clearly the image of women librarians sometimes put forth as delicate and emotional did not characterize welch welch achieved success in her areas of interest academic library administration and teacher librarian training she rarely vacillated usually spoke her mind and had creditable business sense a firm philosophy of librarianship and a good deal of spirit and common sense much of this spirit was still in evidence in interviews with her and one senses with what success she pursued her career when one talks to her colleagues one may reasonably suppose that welch was not atypical certainly she does not view herself as such if anything she might be thought to epitomize the characteristics of a bright and motivated woman of the period the fact that her successes were limited and local and her career not of national significance only serves to underscore the value of reviewing her accomplishments grotzinger has pointed out that the paucity of historical material on women librarians should not be judged as being indicative of the contributions or strengths of women in the profession  p  welch may well exemplify the thousands of librarians who never have been and never will be deweys or sharps or searses but whose very real personal successes fill out the history of librarianship
 the library quarterly early years becoming a librarian eleanor weir welch was born in  in summerset iowa to robert l and annie eleanor weir welch her father a minister seems to have encouraged her intellectual bent and love of study and reading her first library memory was of a close family friend a miss humphries who was a librarian in redlands california and whom welch credits with first introducing her to the idea of a woman becoming a librarian one of the new breed of educated women welch received her bachelor degree in german cum laude from monmouth college in illinois in  following the pattern of most educated young women of the period she began teaching high school language courses in iowa first in allerton for a year then in mount ayr where she had moved with her family i was a teacher because it was the thing you did when you finished college she recalled and i got awful bored with it it was the same thing you studied and read more and read more and read more and your pupils couldn keep up with you  at least they didn they could have but they didn  while teaching at mount ayr she first showed an interest in librarianship by making assessments of items that the public library there needed a friend there assisted her put her in touch with the american library association to purchase library aids and introduced her to dewey work to advance in the teaching profession perhaps to teach on a university level where students were better motivated welch knew that she would have to study german much more thoroughly she also knew that a teaching career was not what she wanted her interest in the mount ayr public library gained her the post of librarian there in  by  she had enrolled in the new york school at albany and her career in librarianship had begun i went to albany i just felt it was the school to go to it was the first one and i decided i go under dewey and i just wrote and applied and to my amazement i was admitted the albany school at that time was one of only three library education programs in the country that demanded a college degree of its applicants for admission  p  actually dewey was no longer associated with the school but he had left his mark there and his name seems to have been a continuing attraction to students at the time welch entered albany library education was undergoing significant changes the williamson report had not yet been written but the problems it identified were being addressed the division between clerical and professional duties was just beginning to be distinguished in library course work the majority of classes dealt with details and techniques and very little theory as brand and others have noted the
eleanor weir welch  divorce from columbia university that preceded the creation of the albany school did not change the program content which was technically oriented lacked a theoretical basis and suffered from a nonacademic environment  p  it is hard to imagine that welch would have been intellectually stimulated by the work there she remembers that the fifty people in her class studied just the things you do when youe going to be a librarian  cataloging  and classification and so forth  yet the zealousness of the library profession at this time still seems to have been imparted to welch as her later work shows welch stayed at the albany school for one year returning in  to finish her course work and earn her certificate in  she accepted a position as head librarian at the wisconsin state teachers college at stevens point where she stayed until  in these intervening years she returned for more library education probably attending courses throughout the summer months at columbia university where she earned her msls in  both minnie sears and isadore mudge whom welch knew well at columbia must have been important influences on her philosophy and practice of librarianship sears in particular seems to have imparted a love of cataloging and an understanding of its role in library use welch would later choose to teach cataloging and she was decidedly particular in recruiting catalogers to work at the illinois state normal university library move to illinois state normal university columbia gave welch a solid basis in library education and the philosophy of librarianship in the summers of  and  she was a visiting lecturer in library education at mcgill university but teaching was not her first choice by this time in her life she was ready for new challenges through meetings of the american library association ala she had become acquainted with gertrude andrews who was an assistant librarian at the illinois state normal university in normal illinois in  the normal university had lost its librarian of thirtynine years with the death of angeline v milner andrews was acting librarian in  and came to the ala annual conference in west baden indiana seeking a replacement for milner welch family had moved to paxton illinois by that time with the family move and the prospect of a greater challenge and more money she agreed to come to normal for an interview president david felmley she remembers looked at me and said uh youe not very big are you i said o you have to be 
 the library quarterly in  when welch first came to isnu the library was housed in rooms over the gymnasium it contained some  volumes employed five full time staff members none of them formally trained librarians and was open sixty hours a week this library had been created in  at the insistence of the students by uniting the wrightonian and philadelphian society libraries as well as a number of classroom collections at the suggestion of the university president a permanent position of librarian was established and in  the first incumbent was appointed angeline v milner or angewith a period as she was universally known in speech and in print milner was a life long resident of bloomington who through family friendships was allowed to attend biology classes in normal this background enabled her to be chosen by the university first to mount specimens for the natural history museum on campus later to produce a catalog of the museum scientific books and finally to be appointed the first librarian she had no formal college education or professional training describing milner career in later years welch documents the fact that she relied on articles from the library journal guidance from public librarians in the area and library institutes to provide her with the needed expertise  p  her application of these aids brought to the library a variety of different ideas and projects including a bibliographic instruction program begun in  a children library collection and an assortment of audiovisual material including stereographs pictures and slides in contrast welch could claim both a formal college education and extensive training in librarianship she brought a different spirit and special knowledge to the library that was to bring it forward as a more active center of the university although the library had already been defined conceptually when welch assumed the directorship in  the changes she made in administrative practices and in library policies amply justified her formal training and prior experience it is difficult to reconstruct just how welch proceeded to improve on the library strengths to correct weaknesses and to initiate her own ideas for a summary of the library growth during her tenure see app a one of her first tasks was to retrieve from the university president office the responsibility for reviewing and approving every book order generated by the library she placed book selection in the hands of the faculty and library staff filling in gaps in important areas selecting whole collections in other areas building what she felt was a basic collection within four years welch had increased the book stock by over  titles meanwhile she also encouraged the use of the library so much so that her reports tell of library rooms desperately overcrowded but popular with students  sitting on the window sills and    books piled in every possible place  p 
eleanor weir welch  another task to which she quickly applied herself was the establishment of the laboratory school library the laboratory school was an important and popular concept in teacher training institutions libraries serving these schools allowed children the advantage of choosing among an array of topics and reading levels teachers too benefited from observation of reading habits and the opportunity for guiding students selections when welch came to isnu there was a wellestablished laboratory school but no space available in the library for a children room isnu faculty and teachers in training chose a few books each week for the laboratory school classes allowing each child to read one book per week faculty frequently complained that this situation prevented them from supervising students reading adequately a separate children collection in the library which elementary students could visit on a regular basis would have been enough to alleviate the problem welch went one better she established a library within the laboratory school itself and then sought funding for a librarian to staff it  the establishment of a laboratory school library was only one part of a larger effort on welch part to upgrade the library another of her first concerns was the comparison of the library holdings expenditures and services with nationally established standards provided by the american association of teachers colleges although isnu had satisfied accreditation standards when inspected in  welch found the library falling behind in materials budget and staffing levels although she rarely used her annual reports to the president to report more than statistical growth in  welch began a campaign in her reports to upgrade university support of the library typical of her nature when one report did not produce results another followed in her  annual report she protested that isnu is the only teacher college in illinois without a trained children librarian who is especially fitted to direct reading tendencies among the pupils of the practice school to direct library club work and to connect the library with the various practice schools  a special report to the president in  identified not only those areas that welch felt needed attention but also potential solutions including means for increasing the materials budget in specific areas  welch report was a succinct statistical presentation of facts it must have been well received her  annual report shows a more than  increase in the materials budget with a new laboratory school librarian administering a collection of  volumes  other areas of library administration and policy received the same sort of attention from welch in  while concentrating on building the collection she also devised ways of assuring balanced growth she had encouraged teaching faculty to take an active role in selecting titles
 the library quarterly for the library but felt there needed to be an allocation of the materials budget to prevent some areas from growing too quickly and others from suffering neglect she presented the president with an analysis of the materials budget based on number of students and courses types of classes relative cost of books by subject and anticipated course growth although not a revolutionary concept in library circles it did represent a new approach for isnu where previously titles had been bought on a demand basis with little guidance from the library or university administration her proposal was accepted and implemented in the new fiscal year the success of welch administration in collection development and budget increases highlighted the need for a library adequate to serve the needs of the university isnu had never had a building devoted solely to library use although the need for one had been there even before welch arrival she again used her annual report as a tool for expressing this need her written campaign this time was couched in understatement the  annual report stated simply the need for a new building for library purposes only is too obvious to need comment  if lengthy memoranda were written detailing the problem they do not now exist in the archives it is not hard to imagine that she simply let the condition of the library speak for itself funding for the building finally came in  with  appropriated by the illinois state legislature and a further  provided by the federal government through a public works administration grant  p  when planning for the building welch was in her element in anticipation of the funds being granted welch spent much of  surveying academic libraries across the country seeking the best library design for isnu she liked the layout and size of the massachusetts state college library at amherst and corresponded with the librarian b wood i will probably take advantage of your kindness and write to you several times if the plans for the building materialize since we are a state institution it will probably mean that we will have a state architect to do the planning and it remains to be seen how much the library will be considered  library plans were submitted in may of  and she considered every detail carefully submitting specific comments and criticisms throughout each phase she worked closely with the library bureau in purchasing every item of furnishing and wrote to colleagues across the country seeking advice on flooring lighting traffic patterns and furniture when selecting chairs she invited students to try out various styles for comfort and durability  the final product made welch and the university proud dedicated in  to the memory of ange milner milner library was then a lovely georgian building erected on the campus quadrangle built to house  volumes it
eleanor weir welch  was designed so that stack additions could be added easily in the future welch was justifiably proud as her several articles on the building show see app b the building and its thoughtful details epitomized welch bent for careful planning and foresight the library she wrote in  became a true college library while it was to be the least expensive of the state college ew libraries its influence in use of color and design and its special services has been felt throughout the colleges of the midwest  p  the activity to which she was most devoted was the establishment of a library science program at isnu ever since the late s when ala board of education for librarianship bel converted the fifth year library degree from a master to a bachelor degree teacher librarian training had posed a controversy the bel decision based on a recommendation offered by the association of american universities caused confusion over what constituted professional and what paraprofessional degrees and particularly engendered discussions in the literature on teacher librarian training  p  with the years of experience at teacher training institutions welch seemed to harbor little confusion herself on the matter she had long recognized that teachers often obtained positions in which they were called on to provide library service of some sort the program of bibliographic instruction created by ange milner may have been adequate for aiding in the use of the college library but it failed to provide the needed information on the establishment and maintenance of school library collections if teachers pursued graduate education it usually was not in library science hence welch believed the teachers and as a result the school libraries suffered from a general ignorance of library practice  p  her program in library science began informally and as with most of her other projects as a clearly defined need in an annual report she first requested aid to teach university courses in bibliography librarianship and the use of books and the library in   it appears she taught a few courses herself for some years by  she had hired a librarian to teach library science courses exclusively by  the courses had become instrumental to teacher training not only through her own efforts but also because teacher training standards were recognizing the value of such training welch had by then succeeded in making library science a minor for a bachelor degree with eight to ten courses taught throughout the year by  the program had grown to such popularity that it was made a major field of study reminiscent of her own experiences as a student in the early part of the century when as much emphasis was given to the personal characteristics of librarians as to their skill the design of the program was pure welch teacher librarians she insisted should have among other characteristics
 the library quarterly poised graciousness and acceptable good manners  enthusiasm for and belief in their profession    a sense of relative values   and a desire to continue learning in addition to regular library science studies the major should provide an appreciation of the arts  hoping the student will be inspired to continue study    and give the fundamentals of science the intellectual cultural and social development of western civilization and the ability to speak in public   although never intended to compete with or replace the library science master programs in the state the teacher librarian program under welch direction was rigorous so much so that she once admitted that perhaps she was expecting too much from her people  in the early years of the program in recognition of her own time constraints and shortcomings welch had the foresight to hire the respected illinois librarian eunice speer to direct the program and was able to work out a system of articulation with the library degree program at the university of illinois at urbana library school in another important area personnel welch realized improvements and laid the groundwork for future successes of new librarians she had started at isnu with a staff of four untrained library workers within ten years she had added five professionally trained librarians although she did this at the cost of losing nonprofessional staff it appears she felt the library strength lay in its high level professional staff students were in abundance then as a result of federal programs and state funded work scholarships and she used this less expensive labor effectively by the time she left the library employed eleven librarians four support staff and many students except for welch appointment in  as an assistant professor no other librarian enjoyed faculty status at isnu for several years an examination of course catalogs indicates that by  welch had succeeded in getting her librarians the faculty rank of assistant professor former isnu president robert bone whom welch served from  to her retirement in  recalled that early in his administration he discussed with welch the rank of milner librarians  at the time the issue was brought up he remembered librarians who had served at least seven years and who held the appropriate graduate degree could be appointed with the rank of assistant professor but could be promoted no further subsequent meetings on this issue between bone and the teachers college board closed meetings with no minutes taken resulted in welch promotion to associate professor and the lifting of a salary ceiling on librarian positions the practice of the board generally was to award full faculty status to those holding the doctorate with only provisional faculty status given to librarians and other less qualified instructors although welch did not win this point entirely she did
eleanor weir welch  succeed in introducing the concept of librarians as faculty to isnu and was able to aid her librarians financially welch efforts in this area allowed succeeding library directors to attain for their librarians status equal to that of the teaching faculty bone remembered too that it was welch who proposed enhancement of support staff wages through the civil service commission in springfield with his support she was able to improve staff pay as a supervisor she was apparently strict but fair what she demanded of others she herself did one librarian commented welch herself recalls the time that president fairchild suggested she take some time from work every other day for one of her favorite pastimes riding her horse zephyr justin she told him that not fair to the other staff members  welch seemed to develop a rapport with students as well unusual evidence of this can be seen in the war letters to her from former students who worked in the library during world war ii many of her male students left for europe and wrote to her regularly welch saved a portion of the letters in a file on the library activities concerning world war i the students wrote to her on every conceivable subject their fears their surroundings and their hopes for the future the day i enroll in a library school wrote one young man in  i shall really be grateful for all that you have taught me but i am grateful now too  ever mindful of her library welch used this correspondence as an opportunity to get a number of war related documents from overseas for the library collection making a special effort to build a collection of propaganda materials she involved herself in the illinois war council women leaders in the war activities of illinois and faithfully followed all ala suggestions for providing information on the war effort bone remembered welch as a dedicated individual who was not ambitious for herself but for the library one reason i liked her as an administrator is that she didn hesitate to disagree with me or argue with me never unpleasantly but she would argue with me and she would sit there and her voice would get almost emotional and she would hold on to it until a decision was made i don think she was ever afraid of me  welch had little to fear she dedicated herself to the isnu library establishing needed collections and services and producing a fine building and a creditable library science program she increased and upgraded the staff and laid the groundwork for many milner library features such as the teaching materials center the rare book room and an active and continuing friends of the library organization her retirement in  appears to have been a quiet affair there is no mention of it in the student newspaper but welch was remembered
 the library quarterly fondly by the editors of the  isnu yearbook for her cry we need librarians  p  public life to her association activities welch brought the same sort of persistence and planning as she did to her work at isnu welch interest in organizational work was limited to those areas that would enhance her understanding and execution of her role as director of milner library and to which she felt she had the most to offer the political power and personal recognition often associated with organizational offices appear to have had little influence on her decision to become involved in any activity she participated in the work of the illinois library association the american library association and the american association of university professors most actively during the last two decades of her career that she delayed such involvement suggests the order of priorities for her professional life not until she thought her own library was running smoothly did she begin to accept any major assignments within organizations although the opportunities presented themselves if for no other reason than by virtue of her title her role as library director in a teacher training institution provided the background for her role in ala within months of coming to isnu she chaired the ala normal school librarians conference midwinter meeting  but it was not until after  when the ala teacher college libraries section became part of the college and reference section that she took a more active role in ala she seemed to be one who accomplished more by talking than by writing  making use of ala conferences to recruit new librarians and exchange ideas always active in the work of the teacher college libraries section in  she accepted the chair of the libraries of teacher training institutes committee an awful title she protested  and her correspondence as an officer reveals more of her perceptions of the role of the library the work to be done and her approach to life coming during world war ii when ala was not meeting regularly to conduct its business her committee appointment as chair lasted from  to  much longer than the customary year i have found she wrote to ben powell in  that people are loathe to undertake committee work and special assignments when they know there is no meeting in the summer to which they can report  true to her concerns at isnu one of her major goals as chair of the committee was the establishment of standards for teacher librarian training she considered the existing ala standards a bit vague and easily stretched to
eleanor weir welch  fit any situation since there is such a great shortage of teachers and an unusual shortage of people with teacher librarian training there will be doubtless a greater tendency than usual to put people without any knowledge into library positions in the smaller schools of the united states  in her role as chair of this committee for so many years she most frequently was involved in developing programs of substance for those times when the section could meet she rarely spoke herself but seemed constantly to ferret out others whom she admired to promote interest and discussion on teacher librarian training in  she was in charge of the ala section program and brought in margie helm librarian at western kentucky state teachers college in bowling green as her main speaker i hesitate to assign a definite topic to you but if you could talk on something like this he teacher college student should be a well read person it is impossible to have children in school who will acquire some cultural tastes unless they catch it from their instructor it rather provokes me that the usual teaching staff think that the college library can put on a campaign that will produce such people over night without allowing the student the time and the quiet to acquire a knowledge of the better things  during the war college  research libraries frequently served as the conference in lieu of meetings and welch was called on to produce an issue dedicated to the work of her section the editor ernest j reece requested that welch submit a piece herself for publication letters to colleagues and to reece reveal some of her unease in performing center stage when she was first approached she confessed to her close friend barcus tichenor i have always felt the disadvantage of having to take research in the college proper and the high school and the elementary school and work over their suggestions to fit teacher college needs and yet when it comes right down to it i cannot think of topics to discuss  she settled on the topic libraries and the coming of workshops conducted a survey to obtain data and in march  finally published the article a survey of welch publications shows them to have been concerned exclusively with practice and mostly with her own library setting within the state welch served her profession on many levels most notably as the illinois library association vice president   and president   she was a frequent speaker at statewide meetings on the topic of school library service and teacher librarian training but as president she maintained a status quo office with few innovations or changes near the end of her tenure as president however she issued her one substantive presidential message on a topic of increasing concern to her and to others censorship a conservative and censorial atmosphere attendant on the mccarthy era had developed librarians
 the library quarterly firm proponents of intellectual freedom by the s were becoming alarmed we can be a strong profession only when all librarians everywhere in every type of library join together she wrote if we share our special knowledge the profession can go forward librarians have given books an important place in our culture so important that books are being attacked by those who fear a free mind and the discipline of individual taste and conscience and by those who fear that their complacency may be disturbed in this day of growing community tensions we need more than ever to be one profession of librarians who will stand together so that there can be no premium on ignorance  p  through her work with the american association of university professors welch also expressed a more general interest in higher education in illinois in  and  welch served as secretary of the association illinois chapter committee on the survey of higher education charged with the responsibility of making both general and specific recommendations on the status and direction of higher education in illinois the committee during welch tenure addressed the issue of administrative control one faction of the committee pushed for a single autonomous board for all institutions in illinois another for separate boards for the university of illinois and for other institutions welch fell in with the former group as was consistent with her desire to eliminate unnecessary duplication of effort and to consolidate and build a board with strength that could obtain for her school the same benefits given to other state institutions  all welch activities outside her library had the common thread of supporting in some manner her work at isnu if any personal ambitions were present they were secondary considerations only more than once welch turned down offices when she felt her library needed her more see for example  conclusion in many ways welch remains an elusive individual shy in her personal life reticent about her achievements but a dedicated and effective librarian deucedly independent she called herself  and independent she was listening first and always to the dictates of her own heart welch was not a luminary not in the vanguard of activities except perhaps in her work with the training of teacher librarians in this sort of quietly competent professionalism however may be found a closer definition of women librarians in the first half of the century i tried to make the librarian a person of opinion who knew what ought to be done and did it welch said i enjoyed it greatly the whole show i enjoyed
eleanor weir welch  and if i didn like it why i did something that all you can do she recognized the needs of her library and institution and fought for the means to satisfy them she could not easily be classified as a feminist was never a suffragette but was aware that society could impose a role on her a role she seemed to shun i felt that a woman had as much ability and often more than a man in the position but i didn think anything of it it was just so probably i was discriminated against but i don think it was so much the fact that i was a woman as the fact that my ideas were discriminated against  welch will never be remembered in the same sphere as mudge eastman or sharp her arena was much smaller and her ideas less than revolutionary she remains however a product of her era as such she exhibited few of those failings thought common to women of this period the story of her solidly successful career suggests that women librarians of her time may have had to struggle not so much with self as with their profession and the environment in which it was practiced appendix a growth of isnu library under welch administration nonprofessionsl professional students staff staff materials enrolled volumes employed employed budget n n fte fte              increase              increase             increase              increase       souce  figures from annual reports differ from figures provided in other documents in most cases the annual report figures are lower than those reported elsewhere appendix b a chronological bibliography of eleanor weir welch the training school library of the state teachers college need and administration ms thesis columbia university  training the teacher librarian illinois libraries  november
