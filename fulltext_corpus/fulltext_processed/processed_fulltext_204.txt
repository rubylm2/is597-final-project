libraries of south carolina    the provincial library the colonists were plain people and rich planters earnest men from every walk in life who came to seek new homes in a new country ramsay says of them though few if any of the early settlers were learned men yet they brought with them general ideas of european culture and as soon as the necessities of life had been secured they adopted measures for promoting the moral and literary improvement of themselves and particularly of the rising generation only thirty years after the beginning of charleston the provincial assembly had an opportunity to establish in the settlement a device by which this laudable purpose might be realized the provincial library the story of this library goes back to england and the reverend thomas bray who was appointed in april i official representative of the bishop of london to the american colonies he was not able to leave for america for several years and during that period of waiting and preparation for his work he recognized the necessity of providing the clergy who were going to the new world with books from this narrow idea of a clerical library dr bray very quickly expanded his concept to include a provincial library for each colony and rapidly set about to accomplish it he realized the expense entailed in establishing such libraries and sought financial help from influential patrons in his request he said it will require a very considerable fund fifty pounds worth of books being the least that can be supposed requisite to enable a minister to discharge the duties of this function besides that in each province it would be requisite to have a library of more universal learning for the service and encouragement of these who shall launch forth in the pursuit of useful knowledge as well natural as divines a further amplification of dr bray original plan for a collection of books for the ministers provided for home circulation of books from the provincial library he said standing ie noncirculating libraries will signify little in the country where persons must ride some miles to look into a book such journeys being too expensive of time and money but lending libraries which come home to m without charge may tolerably well supply the vacancies in their own studies till such time as these lending libraries may be improved into parochial libraries his appeal to provide enlightenment for the colonists had the support of the society for the propagation of the gospel in the colonies and met with generous response from the english people by july  he had raised  of this sum the second largest part  was allocated to the church in south carolina and  books were purchased with it even before all this money had been raised the reverend samuel marshall left england to take up his duties as minister at charleston and brought with him the first lot of books for the new library an entry in dr bray account book reads ffor paper to cover ye bottoms and sides of ye boxes and to lay between ye books belonging to ye library yt was sent with mr marshall to carolina   albert s thomas a sketch of the history of the church in south carolina historical magazine of the protestant episcopal church iv march i    david ramsay the history of south carolina from its first settlement in i to the year xo charleston david longsworth  ii  s bernard c steiner rev thomas bray and his american libraries american historical review ii october i   edgar legare pennington the beginnings of the library in charles town south carolina proceedings of the american antiquarian society xliv new ser april i i

 the library quarterly others in economic and cultural factors in the colony and later the state one of the most obvious of these trends is the establishment of the library as an expression of the society in which it developed south carolina kept in close touch with england and modeled its behavior after that of the mother country books and libraries were among the things that characterized the type of english life reproduced in carolina and they became a part of the social pattern there another noticeable relationship was the marked association between the church the school and the library in some instances the relationship was very definite in others the connection was tenuous but always there was the influence of one creating an atmosphere from which the other was a natural outgrowth library societies were found in communities with a well established economy a sense of permanency and a cultured refined society though there were only a few people of great wealth in south carolina there were many families in comfortable circumstances when the number of such families increased in a neighborhood so that the financial status of the group was assured educational and cultural institutions were set up the influence of local conditions upon the administration of the library was marked the living and working habits of the society members their tastes the size of the book means of transportation these were reflected in the rules and regulations that were formulated for the control of the societies and the use of books flexibility of library organization permitted the establishment of institutions that were keyed to the needs and peculiarities of the various parts of the state except for the provincial library and the proposed pendleton county circulating library all libraries were privately owned and supported by subscription societies for that reason the book resources of a community did not serve the whole population but only a limited group within the area however in some localities persons who were not members of the library societies were permitted to use their books an important point to be considered in this study of libraries is that this was a new country cultural tastes had to be brought from the old world even as material things were imported this included a liking for books and reading in any age of any society the study of history like other social activities is governed by the dominant tendencies of the time and the places in this history of libraries in south carolina it has been necessary to look beyond the biographical record of the various established libraries and to determine the trends in the colony and later in the state during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries that created in the people a desire for books a need not only for privately owned books but for reading materials organized for the use of many this desire was so powerful that it became an activating force in south carolina and transformed what might have been a passive wish for books into functioning library service  arnold j toynbee a study of history d ed london oxford university press  p i
