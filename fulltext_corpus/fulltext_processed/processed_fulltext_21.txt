 gibson minimizing foc experiences it cant be as bad as you say and accusing foc of exaggeration colleagues who receive death threats or other abuse are told that they are overreacting administrators and senior faculty weaponize civility with the subtext of precarity and forced gratitude for foc achievements as means of controlling foc responses to structural racism andor sexism vocalized concerns and opinions are met with reminders that double as accusations i got you hired i nominated you for that award or i got you tenure as though the scholar did not work as hard as her peers to achieve those things in response we are expected to maintain a smile and to cover a multitude of sins with a veneer of calm regardless of the impact on our own careers health or personalinner lives interactions with other faculty are often entwined with this subtext of precarity and the sense that the faculty member should be grateful just to be at the institution to have gotten tenure or to have received funding and that this was not done through their own work but because of a special dispensation or line of funding in some cases departments and colleagues dont deal with issues of race at all and the faculty member is to fend for herself and expected to just be happy they have a job colleagues take the position that life is hard for everyone basically ignoring both the research on foc experiences and the lived experience of their colleague so why should it be any different for faculty of color others acknowledge the problem and attribute it to lack of quality candidatesthe pipelinedeficit argument if there are no foc here it is their own fault they must not want to be here without considering why they might not want to be there it is ironic that this individualistic perspective is written into the modern identity of the field  cronin  even as we focus our energy on the development of systems that control others access to and experience with information while some institutions work toward resolving these inequities many focus on selective diversity hiring one or two faculty members from traditionally underrepresented groupsin lieu of doing the work necessary to enact broader systemic change within their universities and in the field of lis others derail discussions about broad inequity by individualizing and defending what to do fixing racism in the academy would take more space and wisdom than i have here but here are a few points to consider for improving the experiences of faculty of color in lis  do your own reading about how racism sexism and ableism function in academiadont wait for your foc colleague to teach you about racial politics in the united states and academia dont put the onus for teaching on your foc colleague they have their own work to do  speak up about inequities and injusticeagain dont leave all of this work to your foc colleague they have their own work to do
