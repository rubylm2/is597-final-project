lis courses for intersections of health gender and health sexual orientation topics   to the larger schools of thought and areas of interest found in lis as a whole the thematic categories are by no means exclusive but serve as a tool to make sense of the literature reviewed such a categorization scheme of health information can provide a potential framework to represent and market the lis courses on intersections of health gender and health sexual orientation topics the first category included articles that are about a health issue symptom or disease specific to particular populations based on gender andor sexual orientation this is akin to buckland  information in terms of knowledge definition since these articles represented health and gendersexual orientation topics as the subject of the information ie not the people involved such as the user or the mediator the category encompassed articles closely related to gender including those that discussed pregnancy and maternal health pierce  and endometriosis deevey  and those that are traditionally linked to sexual orientation such as hiv aids harris veinot  bella  the category has corresponding similarities with the system centric point of view in equating the system with the disease and focusing on the traits and characteristics of the disease without much attention to the person experiencing the disease or ailment on the other side of the equation the second thematic category included articles that approached the intersection of healthgender andor health sexual orientation topics from the point of view or perspective of the information user whereas the previous thematic category focused on the disease per se the articles in this usercentric category considered the ways consumers of information are involved in the access and use of health information based on gendersexual orientation information needs information seeking information searching information use and attitudes of users within broader human information behavior research saleh  lasisi  were key sub topics within this thematic category articles included those about the information needs of particular populations such as anasi and nwalo  exploration of the reproductive health information needs of adolescent girls in nigerian public secondary schools others examined kuhlthau information search process isp  such as genuis  use of social positioning theory as a lens to understand women healthrelated information seeking and decisionmaking and how they find and make sense of medical information another example was warner and procaccino  use of the isp as a model to assess women behaviors in seeking health and wellness information yoo and robbins  provided an insightful examination of how certain groups of women search for health information on the web also included in this thematic category were articles on the information seeking behavior of women looking for treatments for specific diseases eg symptomatic uterine fibroids ankem  further included in this category were articles such as odusanya and bankole  study of resources nigerian secondary school students use and their attitudes regarding hivaids and mckay    analysis of the health information needs specific to lesbian gay bisexual and transgendered lgbt information seekers a third and closely related thematic category grouped articles that examined how information mediators directly address issues pertaining to the intersection of health gender andor health sexual orientation topics these included articles on the strategies information professionals use to provide access to information related to particular diseases to the affected gendersexual orientation specific populations researchers studied the ways in which teachers healthcare professionals librarians aid workers and others directly affected the consumption of health information by individuals according to their needs keeping in perspective the us
