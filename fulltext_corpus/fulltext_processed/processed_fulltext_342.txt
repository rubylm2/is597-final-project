the nature of relevance in information retrieval an empirical study taemin kim park experimental research in information retrieval ir depends on the idea of relevance because of its key role in ir recent questions about relevance have raised issues of methodological concern and have shaken the philosophical foundations of ir theory development despite an existing set of theoretical definitions of this concept our understanding of relevance from users perspectives is still limited using naturalistic inquiry methodology this article reports an enmpirical study of user based relevance interpretations a model is presented that reflects the nature of the thought processes of users who are evaluating bibliographic citations produced by a document retrieval system three major categories of variables affecting relevance assessments internal context external context and problem context are identified and described users relevance assessments involve multiple layers of interpretations that are derived from individuals experiences perceptions and private knowledge related to the particular information problems at hand introduction and purpose the concept of relevance has played a major role in information retrieval ir research since the s the goal of an ir system is to provide users with access to relevant documents typically performance is measured by how well the system succeeds in retrieving relevant documents recall the proportion of relevant material actually retrieved and precision the proportion of retrieved material actually relevant are often employed as standard measurement criteria in experimental studies  i am grateful to stephen p harter judith serebnick thomas nisonger and samuel guskin for their constructive comments and guidance for this research and the anonymous referees of this article for their thoughtful comments i am also thankful for a research grant from indiana university library in support of the present study  associate librarian serials cataloger indiana university library bloomington indiana  library quarterly vol  no  pp   x  by the university of chicago all rights reserved      
relevance in information retrieval  despite a rich literature on relevance there is no commonly accepted definition although much experimental research in ir is based on the idea of relevance various interpretations of the concept have been made because of its key role in information retrieval research the lack of consensus on the meaning of relevance and relevance assessment raises issues of methodological concern these have been most thoroughly explored by david ellis  in a thought provoking article concerning the use of relevance in information retrieval research ellis questioned the validity and reliability of relevance as a measuring instrument in ir experimental studies furthermore our understanding of relevance is limited due to our lack of understanding of what real users mean by relevance this article attempts to develop an empirical understanding of the concept of relevance as viewed by users of real information systems i view the determination of relevance from the perspective of how users select relevant bibliographic citations in ir that is the purpose of this research was to learn how users make relevance assessments when evaluating citations that are produced by a document retrieval system what are their decision contexts what are the characteristics of those contexts and how are they related to one another i also investigated the contextual changes that occur as a result of an examination of citations whether a citation stimulates a reformulation of the user information problem or provides a connection between the problem and other ideas the exploratory nature of the study is reflected in the design of the research background two comprehensive literature reviews on the subject of relevance already exist by tefko saracevic  and linda schamber michael b eisenberg and michael s nilan  only a selection of literature on the various relevance theories and variables affecting relevance judgments is summarized here the role of relevance in relation to traditional and cognitive models of ir research is discussed in the following sections historical definitions of relevance in information science are well documented by saracevic  one of the obvious dimensions of relevance is about on the topic or on the subject eisenberg and schamber  called this notion topical relevance whether the topic of the information retrieved matches the topic of the request in a recent study schamber and her colleagues  provided an excellent literature review on this topic including users views of relevance they viewed user based
 the library quarterly relevance as follows the locus of relevance is within individuals perceptions of information and information environment not in information as represented in a document or some other concrete form  p  in distinguishing between relevance and pertinence d a kemp  suggested that pertinence requires that a document must have a bearing on a user particular situation to be useful therefore pertinence must be decided by the person with the information need in other words relevance or topical relevance is assessed in relation to a request a statement of information need while pertinence is assessed subjectively by the user according to d j foskett the true distinction is that elevant should be taken to mean elonging to the fieldsubject universe of discourse delimited by the terms of the request as established by the consensus of workers in that field while ertinence should be taken to mean dding new information to the store already in the mind of the user which is useful to him in the work that prompted the request  p  w s cooper proposed the concept of utility and distinguished the term logical relevance from the utility that measures the ultimate usefulness of a piece of information to the user utility was conceived as beyond logical relevance as a catch all concept involving not only topicrelatedness but also quality novelty importance credibility and many other things  p  the term novelty was originally introduced by f w lancaster and e g fayen  novelty is represented as measuring the proportion of relevant retrieved documents that are new to the requester patrick wilson  suggested that relevance is not a single notion but multiple concepts and proposed the idea of situational relevance situational relevance is based on the relation between an item of information and a particular individual personal view of the world and his or her situation in it the piece of information is seen as situationally relevant if it brings a significant change in one view of a situation making a distinction between subjective and objective relevance don r swanson  defined subjective relevance as the mental experience of an individual person who has an information need objective relevance was defined as a logical relationship between a document and an objectified written statement of a request relevance in this sense is a connection between a written request and a document and belongs to the world of objective knowledge finally based on an analysis and interpretation of a theory of relevance proposed by dan sperber and deirdre wilson  stephen p harter  introduced psychological relevance in ir a retrieved citation as a psychological stimulus is found to be relevant to an individual if it causes cognitive change in that individual some of the essential con
relevance in information retrieval  cepts and principles of psychological relevance are context is a psychological construct that represents one assumptions about the world at any given moment it is dynamic changing as contextual effects occur and a necessary condition for an assumption to be relevant in a context is having contextual effects in that context three possible ways of how contextual effects can take place were explained first the assumptions held in the present context can combine with the existing old assumptions to create new assumptions second a new assumption can cause a modification in one or more assumptions from the existing context third a new assumption can strengthen or weaken one or more assumptions in the existing context involved with changes in an individual cognitive state psychological relevance is represented as dynamic and goes well beyond topical relevance our empirical understanding of relevance has been slow to develop two large scale projects on relevance judgments were undertaken experimentally by carlos a cuadra and robert v katter   and alan m rees and douglas g schultz  the purpose of their research was to identify the possible variables affecting relevance judgments and to determine the effects of these variables in a series of more than fifteen experiments cuadra and katter listed the major categories of variables studied  people judges  documents  statements of information requirements  judgment conditions  form of response and  judgmental attitudes the definition of relevance used by their judges was how good an answer the journal article would be to the requirement statement  p  rees and schultz added the utility concept to their definition of relevance the degree to which the document bears on or has application to the research you have heard described and by usefulness we mean the degree to which the document would be useful to you as an individual in other words usefulness should take into account your interest knowledge experience etc in doing this research  p  however neither study examined real users and their information problems summarizing the conclusions of relevance experimentation saracevic  highlighted several major factors affecting the relevance judgment process  judges subjective expertise at the various stages of research  judges subjective knowledge  judges academic and professional training  a document intended use  stylistic characteristics of documents and  aspects and definitions of relevance more recently eisenberg  investigated an application of magnitude estimation an openended scale used in psychophysics for the measurement of relevance judgments his findings suggest that the magnitude estimation method is less influenced by potential biases than category rating scales however eisenberg and carol barry  found in a later investigation that
 the library quarterly both measuring types magnitude and category were affected by the order in which documents are presented lorraine m purgailis parker and robert e johnson  found that the order of presentation does not influence relevance judgments when fewer than fifteen documents are evaluated in a comparison of the relevance judgments between actual users and secondary judges joseph w janes and renbe mckinney  reported that the secondary judges tended to rate documents more highly than actual users their decisions were based on perceived topicality for example the topical information such as indexing and abstracts was used more often than the nontopical informationbibliographic data in ir experimental research the results of relevance judgments are usually treated as binary relevant and not relevant or on a scale measuring degrees of relevance relevance judgments for the evaluation of search results have been made either by search intermediaries or subject experts the flaw of relevance assessments made by nonusers in online searching was well stated by charles t meadow  he raised essential issues concerning how relevance judgments are made as well as by whom and claimed that experimental data concerning relevance are ambiguous relevance and information retrieval testing the cranfield tests  have with some variations been the primary model of experimental ir research during the past twenty five years the research design of the cranfield project provides a conceptual framework for reexamining the underlying assumptions of the traditional ir model and the implications of using relevance judgments in ir evaluation cranfield experimental design involved four major steps  building a test collection  gathering users questions  obtaining relevance judgments and  conducting tests of retrieval the third component obtaining relevance judgments deserves critical attention in particular in examining the impact of relevance since the test results are dependent on these judgments there have been some cases in which the relevance assessments used in experimental studies have been critically evaluated swanson  criticized design flaws in the experimental methodology of the cranfield project particularly that the relevance assessments made during the screening process by a group of graduate students seemed to have missed many relevant documents harter  empirically confirmed swanson hypotheses and questioned the reliability of relevance assessments design problems and problems with relevance judgments in particular are still present as more recent research in online searching con
relevance in information retrieval  firms for example carol h fenichel  and trudi bellardo  used the same search questions which were drawn from the eric ontap file on dialog for their dissertation research however the two researchers disagreed radically on which citations should be considered relevant to the two search questions in a recent work swanson  recalled the enormous disagreement in relevance judgments between the two research teams armed services technical information agency astia and documentation incin a large scale ir test done in  both groups agreed that  documents were relevant to one or more of the  questions but there are another  documents that one team or the other but not both considered to be relevant  p  examining the underlying dimensions of relevance in ir experimentation the cranfield model views relevance as on the topic the relationship between the topic of a question and that of a document the nature of the relationship between a document and a user question is very precise and fixed there are no concerns with the individuality of users the model also assumes that users information needs are conceptually well defined and that they know how to express them the concept of relevance as topical relevance assumed in most ir tests may not be either adequate or sufficient if we consider users as a main focus of an information system lauren b doyle early statements illuminate the limitation of topical relevance in ir evaluation the flaw is that there may be a great difference between relevance to a given request statement and relevance to a person real information need  p  relevance will serve its purpose but will decline as the realization slowly comes that an individual information need is so complex that it cannot be accurately stated in a simple request the fact that people do request information in simple terms is a reflection of the inadequacy of both people and systems and not a reflection of the true structure of the need  p  the difficulty of specifying an information need is well stated by robert s taylor the user has a certain incompleteness in his picture of the world an inadequacy in what we might call his tate of readiness to interact purposefully with the world around him in terms of a particular area of interest  pp   if we accept taylor model of information need there is a significant difference between an information need and a question statement taylor classified an information need into four stages ql the visceral need q the conscious need q the formalized need and q the compromised need taylor defined the visceral need as an actual but inexpressible need for information the conscious need is a conscious mental description of an illdefined problem area at the formalized need a user creates a formal
 the library quarterly statement of his or her information question finally the question is transformed from the formalized level into the compromised level for approaching an information system as taylor model indicates the original need for information tends to be distorted or changed in this process however despite doyle and taylor observations the nature of relevance to real users and their information needs has not been seriously treated in ir research except in recent studies by schamber and her colleagues relevance in cognitive models of information retrieval cognitive studies of ir are concerned with users problems knowledge structures tasks and goals nicholas j belkin  cognitive communication model considers the ir situation as a communication system in which the roles of the participants are primary in belkin model the user evaluates the information based on his or her anomalous state of knowledge ask and the underlying problems and image of the world hence the user information need has an important role in this model of ir p ingwersen  describes the cognitive view of ir as any processing of information whether perceptual or symbolic is mediated by a system of categories or concepts which for the processing device are a model of its world whether the device is a human being or a machine it is the individual knowledge structures of the information processing mechanism  which provide the basis for decisions on which ambiguities or problems should be eliminated information is seen as supplementary to the conceptual system representing the mechanism world model  p  as the ask model suggests the cognitive approach views the information need as a way to solve an anomaly in which something is wrong in one state of knowledge in this view people recognize the need for information but the user cannot specify it exactly because of lack of knowledge susan e macmullin and taylor  examined information need from the perspective of its underlying problem context and speculated on eleven problem dimensions beyond subject matter as new criteria for evaluating information provision some recent research efforts have taken a cognitive approach saracevic et al study  reported that users information seeking contexts such as individual perceptions of the problem definition and the perceived estimation of public knowledge the available literature on a subject had a significant effect on relevance judgments of users in a study on users information seeking and retrieving belkin and others  investigated users tasks goals and their impact on information seeking behavior in the context of an online public access catalog the study combined methods of transaction logging questionnaire and observing
relevance in information retrieval  and interviewing users about their behavior in a report on modeling and measuring user intermediary computer interaction in online searching louise t su and saracevic  presented a user information seeking context as including six attributes problem work stage intent personal or internal knowledge public or existing knowledge and information activities methodology the ultimate goal of an ir system is to provide relevant documents to users users are the prime concern of a system this view is especially appropriate as more ir systems are designed to be used by end users if we place users and their information problems as a main focus of ir evaluation and research relevance should be something that a user perceives in his or her information seeking process relevance in this context totally belongs to an individual situational and psychological state from a user perspective relevance is intrinsically related to a mental process to the criteria used in the evaluation of citations retrieved in the ir process in this sense relevance may be equated with users selection behavior relevance is something that users perceive as they select citations in an ir context this view is consistent with a view of psychological relevance that emphasizes an individual cognitive state and context in the judgment process  the choice of methodology for a study should fit the nature of the research problem the research philosophy and accompanying methodology chosen in this study is naturalistic inquiry constance a mellon stated the rationale for the use of naturalistic inquiry naturalistic researchers are interested in knowing all about each characteristic or element of the social phenomenon and how the elements work together to create the situation under study  p  naturalistic inquiry is an appropriate methodology to understand how end users make the selection decisions of choosing whether or not to look at a document produced by a document retrieval system these are potentially complex phenomena in a real life situation over which a researcher has no control this approach is in agreement with brenda dervin and nilan comprehensive literature review of information needs and uses  in which the authors pointed to a lack of definition or understanding of basic concepts such as information information need and underlying assumptions about ir systems and suggested a paradigm shift in library and information science research away from the traditional experimental model the data collection method chosen for this research was based on the
 the library quarterly belief that the naturalistic inquiry method is appropriate to reflect the underlying meaning of relevance in users contexts because of its potentially complex and subjective nature i did not make an attempt to provide an a priori definition of relevance people arrived at their own definitions using a naturalistic approach the subjects for the study were users in real academic search situations who received an online search during the summer session or fall semester  a letter concerning my possible contact of subjects was sent to all users at the time they received the results of their searches the subjects were purposefully selected they participated in this project voluntarily sharan b merriam stated a rationale for choosing purposive sampling purposive sampling is based on the assumption that one wants to discover understand gain insight therefore one needs to select a sample from which one can learn the most  p  i decided to use purposive sampling rather than random sampling of subjects because i hypothesized that relevance from a user perspective would vary by different user groups and an individual information seeking problem and context the sampling selection strategy followed judith preissle goetz and margaret diane lecompte  criterion based method a quota selection was used in selecting the initial group i chose a small number of cases one faculty member and one doctoral student as an initial purposeful sample a subset of the whole the subsequent cases were selected based on the typical case selection method using this method subjects are selected who display attributes and meet criteria to maximize information gained from previous cases yvonna s lincoln and egon g guba  emphasize that naturalists are concerned that context is critical the decision to stop sampling was based on information redundancy not facilitation of generalization different user groups and problem oriented searches at different stages of research were chosen deliberately the ten subjects included three faculty members a visiting scholar five doctoral students and a master student their disciplines were education three library and information science three sociology two anthropology one and criminal justice one brief information concerning each subject is included in the appendix the databases searched were eric sociological abstracts child abuse and neglect medline psycinfo social scisearch dissertation abstracts online philosopher index mla bibliography us political science documents and national newspaper index  online searches were conducted by students in l information storage and retrieval a course offered by the school of library and information science indiana university
relevance in information retrieval  the interview itself started with a brief introduction and my explanation about the purpose of the interview and the research each subject was assured that the result of data collection would be kept confidential reasons for using a tape recorder to record the interview were explained and permission was requested the interview was conducted in a semistructured way it was guided by a list of questions to be covered but the sequence or the exact wording was not followed open ended questions concerning each subject information seeking context including the problem area the stage of research the expected product of research results and behavior related to selection of citations were asked each interview took between forty five and sixty minutes the interview tape was transcribed the printed output of the search results served as secondary sources of needed data for this study this source helped me as well as the subjects trace the thinking process in response to each citation on the list the verbalization of thoughts along with each citation helped individuals to be motivated and to organize their own reasoning behind the assessment of a citation the design process was flexible enough to maximize the free flow of thinking and to view the natural approach of each subject to each citation i allowed the subject to choose his or her own method of going through the list of retrieved citations the data collected through the interviews were a collection of users verbal descriptions about their own reasoning and thoughts behind their perceptions and evaluation judgments for each citation the full description of each case was read and examined in depth for the purpose of unitization of data and eventual categorization following lincoln and guba  strategy unitization is a process of identifying the units of information that serve as the basic idea of formulating categories the unit is the smallest piece of information that can stand by itself a unit can be a phrase sentence or paragraph the analysis of data focused on representing the recurring themes of each subject relevance interpretation for each citation retrieved the development of categories was guided and influenced by the research purpose and the researcher knowledge in addition to her educated and intuitive hunches as with other approaches to research the naturalistic researcher should be sensitive to the biases inherent in this type of research the researcher must admit that some of her own biases may have been filtered through the data collection and interpretation stages in particular ross atkinson  typology of librarians decision contexts in book selection inspired me prior to and during the data analysis of this research atkinson proposed a theoretical model that illustrates the decision contexts of librarians as they practice collection development of library materials atkinson model describes the decision contexts of
 the library quarterly the selection process influenced by a citation and shows how and what decision contexts are generated by and reflected in this process he defined three contexts the syntagmatic context concerns variables within the citation itself the context of supplementation is sensitive to the selection sources for example book reviews and the context of resolution derives from the librarian experience with the collection the patron and the subject literature the main thrust of atkinson model is defining a citation as intertext which is interwoven to a large network including personal contextual and institutional factors atkinson model provided an initial structure and source for classifying my data for the purpose of the pilot project the model provided useful insights for looking at a citation in relation to a text and its intertextual function however as atkinson model is hypothetical without supporting empirical data it was not precise enough to capture the richness of my data the decision to use atkinson model for the purpose of data analysis was changed after the pilot project because of the incongruence between the data in the present study and atkinson typology these differences will be discussed later in this article since a naturalistic inquiry starts with different premises from the conventional quantitative method the conventional measures of reliability and validity are not directly applicable the primary rationale for using qualitative research lies in understanding and interpretation rather than predicting cause and effect relationships and generalization of findings lincoln and guba  proposed substitute criteria for assessing the quality of naturalistic inquiry credibility transferability dependability and confirmability credibility is used to refer to internal validity and is concerned with credible findings and interpretations merriam  stated that validity must be assessed in terms of interpreting the investigator experience transferability is the naturalist version of external validity the definition of reliability is similar to dependability for naturalistic inquiry some alternative techniques described by lincoln and guba  were applied for the purpose of increasing credibility the technique of member checking was used to test the validity of data members were sent raw data for their reactions nine of the subjects were involved in testing the analytic categories and interpretations that emerged from the research an attachment of the interview transcription was sent to the subjects who evaluated it for overall accuracy and credibility they were asked to check whether my representations of their perceptions and realities were adequately reflected giving them an opportunity to react and confirm or change them five members reported and corrected some typographical errors in interview transcriptions and the rest of them agreed with my data analysis and interpretation
relevance in information retrieval  the peer debriefing technique is a process of exposing one research to colleagues for comments on the findings to increase the credibility of findings peer debriefing was used to test and clarify my bias for data analysis and interpretation the goal of peer debriefing was achieved by preparing and distributing a manuscript based on my dissertation and prepared for publication to three of my colleagues at the indiana university library also some members of my dissertation committee provided feedback on the clarification of categories and interpretation regarding the data analysis inconsistencies between models of earlier and later versions were pointed out by colleagues and committee members and were adjusted accordingly the adequacy of the labels of the variables were also noted and modified data analysis and findings the goal of the data analysis was to capture the recurring themes that emerged as users evaluate bibliographic citations the variables in the model summarized here are not based on the previous theory but rather were developed from data themselves specific findings will be discussed later on the surface relevance can be looked at as a relationship between a user and a citation however one interpretation of a citation is rooted in various sources a user evaluation of a citation can be analyzed in two ways from the attributes of the citation itself and from the contexts in which the evaluation takes place the data analysis represents those two dimensions which i call citation based and user based the first part of the analysis is concerned with users interpretation of the aspects or components of a citation an interpretation of a citation is presented to illustrate how a user views and filters an element or interconnections among elements of a citation the second part of the analysis focuses on an examination of underlying factors influencing the choice of a citation those factors seem to fall into three major categories based on an individual experience perception and knowledge of the information problem the second part of the analysis characterizes those sources of relevance assessments as based on internal factors external factors or factors related to the problem context the internal context reflects a user interpretation of a citation based on his or her own prior experiences or perceptions in the information problem area the external context refers to factors that are particular to this search and research the external context contrasts with the internal context in the sense that the origination of the external context stems from an individual perceptions and situations in relation to the search process the stage of research and the priority of information
 the library quarterly needs related to the present search there are other perspectives on the interpretation of a citation a user is continuously assessing the value of information and interpreting a citation in order to learn and shape the research problem the problem context is a content oriented context and indicates the various implied uses of information in relation to expanding one thoughts and constructing one ideas in the problem area the three categories are not discrete but rather interconnected and they influence one another the following sections describe the major categories that emerged from the data and shows a sample of the raw data with minimal interpretation in order to allow readers to make their own interpretations in this article i have listed only some examples of my raw data a full description of instances for each category and subcategory is found in my dissertation  interpretation of a citation this section of data analysis illustrates a user initial approach to citation selection how the user assesses interprets and understands a citation the data analysis shows how a user perceives the value of each element of a citation in relation to his or her interest and need for information the analysis is further subcategorized to reflect how the individual combines and balances elements of a citation citation variables seem to serve as stimuli in relation to the major contextual variables a titlethe title plays a leading role in a user understanding of the subject matter of a citation key terms in the title alert the user to the area of interest when the words in the title represent the subject matter of the information need well the title independently becomes a sole decision source the following statements by subjects show the importance of the title i know exactly what i looking for    the social construction of meaning pragmatism video there are these certain words i worked on it for two years before i did this search i have a much better idea of what i looking for subject  i looking for phrases or terms that alert me to something relevant to me the best analogy i can give is when i teach a field work course we talk about using sensitizing concepts and these are terms that point you in the direction of something like    for an anthropologist a sensitizing concept is kinship or society or family well for me these concepts aren very precisely defined but they orient you to looking for that kind of thing well i have those in my head too for this study those concepts  see the appendix for a brief description of each subject
relevance in information retrieval  are things like liberalism or social criticism or moral theory i look for those kinds of terms in the title subject  b style of the titlethe readability of the title and the use of language can be reasons for rejection it has to be readable it can be too technical if it sounds too technical i not going to read and all of these sound very technical my searcher said these might be possibilities theye all very technical sounding to me subject  c author namethe author status plays a distinctive role in the evaluation process a prominent scholar in the field tends to become an independent decision source regardless of subject matter an individual perception of the author influences the decision previous connection with an author seems to evoke the interest of the user conversely a citation on the subject might be rejected if an individual perception of the author is poor this one ace and crime what evidence is there that race influences results in the criminal justice system i got this because he norval morris is a very distinguished scholar and a very thoughtful man this is not an empirical study at all but i was sure it would be interesting because everything he writes is interesting subject  d journal name and document typethe perceived quality of the publication influences the selection process and may become a sole source for negative or positive decisions the user knowledge and perception about the journal and its status in the field help formulate the decision the accessibility of the journal also seems to influence the selection decision there are some i can rule out in other words    we chose journals in philosophy management planning and political science we didn choose journals in medicine or in economics or in history religion the reason i didn look at journals in religion is because they would take a particular slant on this or a particular approach to it that i not interested in i interested more in that in relation to political science or evaluation subject  the next article is with the chronicle let see what it all about i may do this too because we have here a congressperson involved with it so i like to see this article is fairly interesting if it wasn in the chronicle i might not take this one at all for my field the chronicle of higher education is the newspaper that describes the day to day goings on and so it interesting for me to read it easily accessible and there will be a lot of very good things in the chronicle subject  as i will show later the name of the journal also plays a supportive role in the decision process through interconnections with other elements in a citation
 the library quarterly the user discrimination as to types of documents indicates his or her perception about the value of the information for example availability up to dateness and the scope and the quantity as well as quality of information as indicated by document type influence the selection consideration a dated conference paper if it contains research of interest to me should eventually be published and if it not published then it not of interest to me this is another conference paper eaningful research and program evaluation in correction that even older  and it a very weird conference it a very small backwater association i not interested in that subject  comments on eric documents also illustrate this point one thing that depresses me is that these are all d which are usually microfiche and if it long like this one ninety eight page d if this is not available if i can order this from the house wherever it from i don think i going to use the microfiche unless it is fascinating or brand new subject  he time for assertive action school strategies for promoting the educational success of at risk children sounds very good but it a report of a commissioner task force in new york on an eric document and i doubt that it would be good getting the document might be difficult and also you know when you get something that specific like someone put out a document of what theye done it might not be that useful in terms of being written for a wider audience it may be very specific i don know it would be a lower value of priority subject  e abstractindividual users showed different perceptions and perspectives about abstracts abstracts play a supporting role in the interpretation of a citation if a citation otherwise has enough bearing on an individual state of knowledge however if the elements of a citation do not serve to alert the researcher the abstract plays a major role in the interpretation of a citation content some of the abstracts are more descriptive than others from some abstracts i can get a pretty good idea of what the study involves others are less clear more vague here we have the title the journal the person and the year i don think i even looked at the abstract here because i knew immediately i wanted this one again because i have information about this that helps me decide whether to use it or not if it is an uninformative title and an unusual journal and a person i don know then il read the abstract more carefully subject  users have different approaches in using an abstract in the selection of a citation a doctoral student who is at the beginning stage of her research mentioned that key words in the abstract is the number one criterion then i look at the title of article and journal and the author would be the fourth criterion subject  a graduate student who is

 the library quarterly experience and educational background the user knowledge of the research area and of appropriate search terms influences the decision process and justifies selection or rejection decisions a user previous experience and perceptionsthe following instances show that an individual researcher perceptions and knowledge about journals as well as about authors and their previous works and affiliated academic programs or institutions can influence a decision when the user perception about the journal is marginal previous association with the author or the author affiliated academic program tends to support a decision this one is interesting the article titled mpact of a restricted natural language interface on ease of learning and productivity and this one was i think it published in communications of the acm which it hard to tell whether it research or not because sometimes they publish some research studies but not all the time but i guess there are four authors and almost all of them are yeah they are from houston they are faculty members at the rice university in houston texas and i got some citations some of the articles or some dissertations that were done at houston about user interface so they might be highly relevant subject  the user assumptions or beliefs about the information problem area also tend to influence his or her interpretation of the citation and selection attitude he library assistant high level paraprofessional i think that an awful lot of our clerical routines repetitive things are no longer even done in academic libraries by staff people i think that wee turned much of that over to student assistants just as we have turned over much of what we used to do in the past much of what librarians used to do in the past has been turned over to what were formerly clerical people but now theye expected to operate at a paraprofessional level and make some decisions that we would have made historically that why i want to look at this article because it high level paraprofessional in reference to the library assistant and i think that is true especially as we add more and more technology to libraries i want to see if that study refers to a change in the level of our expectations of staff in libraries in general underneath all of this you see i have a belief that people who are paraprofessional in libraries probably need different reward systems than people who are doing clerical jobs subject  b user level of expertise in the problem areaan individual researcher interpretation of a citation in terms of its subject matter seems to be rooted in her knowledge of the problem area there are a lot of different things going on here in evaluating this citation so i sort of
