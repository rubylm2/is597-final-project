  journal of education for library and information science speaking out analysis of the experiences and opinions reported by recent graduates of the university of south carolina mlis program by gayle douglas this study identifies differences in the experiences of traditional students and distant learners who recently completed the university of south carolina master of library and information science program despite the program emphasis on full student participation and the same instructional experience regardless of distance this study identifies a number of demographic characteristics that make achieving that goal difficult if not impossible survey respondents offer contrasting opinions of campus based and televised courses as well as disparate levels of program satisfaction interaction resource availability and early career progress introduction the purpose of this study was to determine if there are significant differences in the experiences of recent graduates who participated in the university of south carolina usc master of library and information science mlis program as  traditional students in south carolina  distant learners in south carolina or  distant learners in cohorts in other states survey respondents offer consistent yet sharply contrasting opinions of courses on the columbia campus and courses televised to other sites demographics for the three groups provide a basis for explaining the variance in their reactions to questions concerning program satisfaction interaction with faculty and other students patterns of locating resources with which to complete assignments and early career progress usc faculty make every effort to offer students the same instructional experience regardless of their location socialization and student interaction are enforced as well as encouraged although the graduates surveyed took the same classes at the same time the patterns of their responses suggest striking discrepancies in their actual experiences and in their instructional preferences methodology in its continuous cycle of assessment the usc college of library and information science conducts a comprehensive survey of alumni every few years the survey consists of two parts the first part is a forced choice section of likert scale responses to questions concerning courses faculty delivery systems and socialization the second section contains questions related to demographics career progress and professional activities responses to these questions were also forced with some information age salary etc stated in ranges the complete text of the  survey is available from the author six hundred and ninety eight students completed the university of south carolina mlis program from december  through volume  number 
speaking out   about the author gayle douglas is assistant dean college of library and information science university of south carolina columbia may  fortythree graduates were not contacted because the college did not have a current address for them and eleven surveys were returned as undeliverable thus the useable population for this study numbered  a total of  surveys  were returned survey responses were entered into a spreadsheet and grouped according to the number of televised courses taken during the thirty six credit hour normally twelve courses mlis program the south carolina commission on higher education considers any student who completes more than fifty percent of a degree program away from the columbia campus to be a distant learner based on this description the  respondents who took up to six televised courses are referred to in this report as traditional students distant learners  those students who took seven or more televised courses  were then grouped according to the state in which they lived immediately prior to entering the degree program students residing in georgia maine and west virginia completed their degree programs in specific three year time frames these respondents  are referred to as distant education cohort participants the remaining distant learners were residents of south carolina and a few adjoining counties in georgia and north carolina this group of seventy seven graduates are referred to as south carolina distant learners background the university of south carolina has been a national leader in distance education for over thirty years live interactive televised classes reach students in many disciplines throughout the state the usc college of library and information science began televising courses in south carolina in  during the following decade faculty became skilled in integrating advanced technologies into their courses satellite delivery replaced the original fixed isdn system for the university in   the number of televised courses increased and with broadcasts no longer restricted to south carolina the college accepted invitations to deliver the full mlis program via distance education into georgia and west virginia neither of which had a publicly funded program of library and information science the college  venture into west virginia and georgia was the first time in the history of library and information science education that a full mlis degree program had been offered by an american library association ala accredited program using distance education technologies and live interaction in the period    the usc college of library and information science taught  televised courses with a total student enrollment of  distance education technologies have enabled hundreds of south carolina students and more than  students in cohorts in georgia and west virginia   and in maine  to complete usc master degree program in library and information science while remaining in their own communities most of these graduates would not have been able to leave their hometowns families and careers to attend classes on the columbia campus at the root of the college achievement in distance education is a learning environment that encourages full student participation regardless of distance a typical televised course may have students in the studio in another building on campus and in locations across south carolina and other states strong emphasis is placed on winter 
  journal of education for library and information science socialization and student interaction televised courses have at least one face toface session for which all students meet at a central location in their states group projects often involve students from more than one state communicating asynchronously and listservs are an active and lively means of dialogue among students course specific web pages provide syllabi schedule updates class notes and links to outside resources fax machines and toll free telephone numbers are standard communication tools and the support system in place for students is flexible and efficient clis faculty make every effort to offer traditional students and distant learners the same instructional experience this study identifies a number of demographic characteristics however that make achieving that goal difficult if not impossible as recent graduates from south carolina west virginia georgia and maine provide discerning information on their classes their interaction with faculty and each other and their early careers the students analysis of the demographic data submitted by recent graduates provides a pattern of some rather distinct characteristics for comparing traditional students south carolina distant learners and distant education cohort participants in other states traditional students are the youngest with  in the under thirty age group less than half are married and  are males three fourths of the distant education cohort participants are over forty and married and  ofthat group are females in south carolina distant learners tend to be over forty married females all three groups are predominantly white tables i iv illustrate these trends part time enrollment status is indicative of distant learners in south carolina and in other states only  of the distant education cohort group were full time students taking at least three courses each fall and spring  attended classes on a part time basis taking one or two courses each semester and  were able to switch from part time to full time during the regular semesters  of the south carolina distant learners were full time students and  switched between full time and part time enrollment  of traditional learners pursued their mlis degree on a full time basis in the fall and spring semesters  were part time and   were full time some semesters and part time some semesters during the summer sessions all distant learners enrolled in some fashion while  of the traditional students took the summers off full time summer school attendance was reported by  of the distant education cohort participants  of the south carolina distant learners and  of the traditional group when asked to state their enrollment preference  of the distant education cohort participants replied that they would have chosen fall time enrollment just under half of the south carolina distant learners and  of the traditional learners expressed a preference for full time enrollment a student employment status has a great deal to do with the decision to enroll full time or part time  of the distant education cohort distant participants and  of the south carolina distant learners were employed in permanent full time positions while enrolled in the mlis program only  of the traditional students worked full time  of traditional students did not work at all during their program and  held graduate assistantships that required ten to twenty hours of work per week only  of the distant education cohort participants and seven percent of the south carolina distant learners did not work while completing their degrees graduate assistantship opportunities were available to  of the south carolina distant learners none of the distant education cohort participants held graduate assistantships volume  number

 journal of education for library and information science chart  compares employment status and enrollment status in the fall and spring semesters it was not uncommon especially in the georgia and west virginia cohorts for students to have worked in libraries before they entered usc mlis program prior library experience was reported by  of the distant education cohort participants  of the south carolina distant learners and  of the traditional students these figures were conversely reflected by the percentages of students who completed internships as a part of their programs of study those with the most experience were least likely to request an internship in reviewing the results of this survey one must assume that a certain bias will influence students responses to questions requiring an opinion rather than a hard fact an important dynamic in this study is what might be called the gratitude factor  of the distant education cohort participants and  of the south carolina distant learners could not have participated in the mlis program if televised courses had not been available these students were quite candid in their appreciation of the opportunity to earn the degree only  of the traditional students were as dependent on televised course delivery and several indicated that they only enrolled in televised courses to facilitate their schedules the gratitude factor is perhaps most evident in response to the question would you encourage others to take televised courses in the college the overwhelming reply from distant learners was yes   in cohorts and  in south carolina traditional students were less enthused with a response rate of sixty eight percent indicating that they would encourage enrollment in televised courses chart  illustrates these responses graduates were asked to respond to a number of questions related to the courses and delivery systems they had personally experienced in their degree program many questions required a response for campusbased columbia courses and another for televised courses comparisons were then made of the types of course delivery system as ranked by each of the three groups of respondents it should be noted here that all respondents expressed generally high levels of course and program satisfaction levels of academic achievement were consistent among the groups as well it is only by considering degrees of approval that the contrasting ratings of campus based courses and televised courses come into focus courses faculty and delivery effectiveness of instructors presentations all traditional students rated their instructors presentations in classes taught on the columbia campus as effective or very effective that figure decreased to  for south carolina distant learners and  for the distant education cohort participants for televised classes  of traditional students rated their instructors presentations to be effective or very effective this contrasts with the  of south carolina distant learners and the  of the distant education cohort group who rated televised class presentations effective or very effective courserelated interaction with instructors all traditional learners and all of the south carolina distant learners reported adequate to abundant interaction with the instructors of columbia courses only  of the distant education cohort group responded in the adequate to abundant interaction range  of the south carolina distant learners and  of the distant education cohort group rated their course related interaction with their instructors as adequate to abundant in televised courses for traditional learners in televised courses the rate of positive response dropped to  quality of course related interaction with instructors when asked to rate the quality of their interaction with the instructors of columbia volume  number

 journal of education for library and information science distant education cohort participants  were comfortable asking questions in televised courses a similar pattern is seen with south carolina distant learners and traditional students  of south carolina distant learners were comfortable asking questions when classes were on campus but only  felt at ease in televised courses  of traditional students were comfortable asking questions in columbia courses with a decrease to  in televised courses participation in class discussions is encouraged regardless of the delivery method being employed  of the traditional students were comfortable participating in class discussions in columbia courses but only  in televised courses  of the south carolina distant learners were comfortable participating in class discussions on campus as were all of the ten distant education cohort students who were able to take courses in columbia with televised courses however only  of the south carolina distant learners and  of the distant education cohort participants said they were at ease during class discussions interaction with other students in classes and the quality of that interaction    of distant education cohort participants reported adequate to abundant interaction with their fellow students in columbia classes as compared to  in televised classes the quality of student interaction was rated good to very good by all respondents in the distant education cohort group in columbia classes and by  of the distant education cohort group in televised courses  of the south carolina distant learners reported adequate to abundant interaction with their fellow students in columbia classes as compared to  in televised classes the quality of student interaction was rated good to very good by all south carolina distant learners in columbia classes and by  of the same students in televised courses  of traditional students reported adequate to abundant interaction with other students in columbia classes and  rated that interaction as good or very good in televised classes only  of traditional students rated interaction with other students as adequate or abundant and  found the quality of that interaction to be good or very good when asked to indicate in ranges often the number of students with whom they were well acquainted  of the south carolina distant learners replied to the greater than  categories for televised courses as compared to   for columbia courses    of traditional learners considered themselves well acquainted with more than ten students in columbia classes but in televised classes the percentage dropped to   of the distant education cohort participants considered themselves well acquainted with more than ten students in columbia classes in televised classes that percentage rose to  involvement with peer support group students were asked the extent to which they considered themselves part of an informal peer support group  of the distant education cohort participants reported being involved or very involved in a peer support group in televised courses in columbia courses only  ofthat group replied in the affirmative south carolina distant learners reported little difference in their involvement in peer support groups  in columbia classes and  in televised classes traditional students reported involvement in peer support groups at the rate of  in columbia classes and  in televised classes participation in class related discussions with fellow students  of traditional learners reported frequent participation in class related discussions with fellow students after their columbia volume  number

 journal of education for library and information science in describing the research patterns of distant education cohort participants it should be noted that the majority of cohort members who actually enroll in columbia classes do so in the summer they generally find a room on campus and take as many courses as they can so that they can speed up their degree progress thus it is not surprising that the main campus library is listed by these students as their primary source of reference materials for columbia classes in televised classes the distant education cohort participants overwhelmingly seek materials at local academic libraries second and third choices are local public libraries and other when south carolina distant learners take classes on campus they too gravitate to the thomas cooper library local college and university libraries are used as well for televised classes south carolina distant learners first seek resources in local college and university libraries then in local public libraries the following tables show the responses concerning location of reference materials factors affecting decision to enroll in courses available through distance education distant learners were asked to indicate all of the factors that influenced their decision to enroll in courses available through distance education the factor most often listed by the cohort group and the group of south carolina distant learners was distance from columbia followed by job responsibilities family responsibilities time constraints and community responsibilities traditional learners most often listed job responsibilities as their reason for taking televised courses closely followed by distance from columbia other factors in order of frequency were family responsibilities and time constraints course delivery preference graduates were asked to indicate the type of course delivery they would have preferred if their personal circumstances had allowed a choice for the distant education cohort participants and the south carolina distant learners  and  respectively said they would not have changed the way they took their courses  of the distant education cohort participants would have preferred to take all courses on the columbia campus another  would have preferred more live courses at off campus locations and  would have liked more televised courses south carolina distant learners indicated similar preferences  would have preferred to enroll only on the columbia campus with no televised classes and  would have preferred face to face classes at a location other than the columbia campus presumably in their own communities just under  of the south carolina distant learners would have preferred more televised classes the responses from traditional students create a different picture of preferences  of traditional students would have preferred to take all courses live on the columbia campus this figure confirms the grumbling among students on the columbia campus who feel pressured to enroll in televised classes in order to fit a particular course into their program in a particular semester  expressed no desire to have changed the way they took their classes  would have preferred to take more live courses at offcampus locations and only  would have preferred more televised courses internship and interaction with faculty during internship students in south carolina  of traditional and  of distant learners were more likely than distant education cohort participants to complete an internship during their mlis program only  of the distant education cohort students had internships this discrepancy appears to be related to library experience distant education cohort participants averaged slightly over eight years of library experience prior to their enrollment in the mlis program more than either the south carolina distant learners six volume  number

 journal of education for library and information science early career progress effect of mlis degree if person remained in the same library  of the distant education cohort participants had the largest average amount of prior library experience and were most likely to remain in the same library after graduation within that library  reported that earning the mlis degree resulted in an increase in the level of their position and  reported an increase in their salaries one half of the south carolina distant learners with prior experience remained in the same library after graduation the degree meant an increase in their position levels for  ofthat group and an increase in salary for  less than one half of the traditional learners worked in a library prior to enrolling in the mlis program and only  of those with experience remained in the same library of those who stayed  received a position upgrade and  were given a raise in salary relationship of program of study to career path students entering the mlis program often plan a program of study without having a clear picture of exactly what the real world of library and information science is like even students with some prior experience may perceive professional positions in a way that is not entirely realistic they may set their career goals on one particular area of service or type of library only to find that environment unsuitable or unavailable the alumni surveyed were asked a series of questions designed to gauge whether the focus of their coursework coincided to any degree with their careers both at the entry level and in their present positions chart  illustrates the percentage of each group who reported that they had worked at some time since graduation and are presently working in the area of service upon which their mlis programs focused chart  illustrates the percentage of each group who reported that they had worked at some time since graduation and are presently working in the type of library upon which their mlis programs focused of the respondents currently working in library and information services chart   of the traditional learners reported that their positions are considered professional by their organizations and    said that the mlis degree was a requirement for the position that figure was slightly less for distant learners  of the south carolina distant learners now hold professional level positions  of which required the mlis degree among distant education cohort participants  have secured professional positions yet only  of those positions required the mlis degree as a hiring qualification it would appear that providing the mlis degree is not the only role of the library school faculty and staff also must serve as advocates for the value of the degree to the profession graduates of usc mlis program frequently keep in touch with the college during their job searches and their stories suggest that states without accredited programs of library and information science accept the shortage of degreed librarians as an unfortunate reality the data shown in charts  and  illustrate this information involvement in the profession distant education cohort participants show the highest levels of involvement in both state and national professional associations when compared to the south carolina distant learners and the traditional students distant education cohort participants are most likely to accept committee appointments most likely to serve as elected officers and most likely to contribute to the literature of library and information science the charts below illustrate the differences reported conclusion the information provided by recent graduates of the university of south carolina mlis program confirms the common perception of the distant learner white female over thirty working mil time volume  number 
speaking out  taking classes part time involved with family and community responsibilities and often experienced in library work the majority of the distant learners who participated in this study could not have completed their degree programs without televised classes and were enthusiastic about the various communication and delivery media involved  of the distant education cohort participants and  of the south carolina distant learners said they would encourage others to take televised courses in the college traditional students who responded to this survey are quite another story these students are predominately white female under forty and either single or divorced their tendency was to attend school fulltime and work part time often in a graduate assistantship that provided a stipend and reduced tuition although many of the traditional group enrolled in at least one televised course their comments indicate that their purpose in doing so was to maximize their schedule options not to experience distant education only  said they would recommend the televised courses the distinction between traditional students and distant learners was particularly striking in the fifteen questions that required respondents to express an opinion traditional students preferred columbia classes to televised classes in every one of the question scenarios included in this survey more subtle differences surfaced among the two groups of distant learners distant education cohort participants found the effectiveness of their instructors class presentations to be higher in televised courses than in columbia courses and they also expressed a higher level of personal commitment to their televised courses distant education cohort participants also rated televised courses preferable to columbia courses in the following survey areas related to personal contact interaction with instructors interaction with fellow students the number of students with whom they were well acquainted involvement in peer support groups participation in classrelated discussion with fellow students and achievement of a sense of class unity as did their counterparts in other states south carolina distant learners found the faculty televised class presentations more effective than those classes held on campus they reported a higher level of personal commitment to televised courses in the realm of personal contact south carolina distant learners revealed that they had more student acquaintances more peer support and more frequent class related discussions in televised classes a troublesome trend in this data appeared in the questions related to asking questions and participating in class discussions in televised classes all of the respondents to this survey reported that they were more comfortable in this area in columbia classes than in televised classes students must be encouraged to become more actively involved in classroom discussions regardless of the medium class listservs have become important supplemental tools in the learning environment of the college with listserv involvement mandatory in some courses faculty comments indicate that students are generally less reticent on listservs than they are in other situations it would be interesting to study a correlation of students patterns of class participation with their patterns of listserv participation the quantitative results of this study will be integrated with previous course evaluation and program approval data into the college continuous planning and assessment efforts knowledge of the traits that distinguish traditional students south carolina distant learners and cohort members will assist the faculty in areas such as advisement course planning and the management of communications media knowledge of their enrollment patterns will impart a new focus to the scheduling process knowledge of their early careers may suggest refinement of the placement services available in the college the demographic profile of each group will be winter
