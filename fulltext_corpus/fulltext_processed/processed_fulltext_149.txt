correspondence to the editor there is no validity to lorna peterson thoroughly negative review of lee shiflett louis shores defining educational leadership library quarterly  october    central to the critique is her belief that what we understand about librarianship from this work remains open for this biography is the chronicling of a life not an interpretation lee shiflett packs his work with details but does not apply imagination or explanation to them a few years ago i asked sir martin gilbert the primary author of the multivolume biography of winston churchill how he felt when his critics called him a chronicler he laughed and said he considered it a compliment he could well have added that biography and history are in the details in this masterfully written book shiflett relates the facts and lets shores his work his environment and his impact on the profession reveal themselves i believe that peterson displays her inability to apprehend this when she writes throughout the book shiflett presents enough examples from shores life to suggest that he was an opportunistic pushy egotistical eccentric man prone to exaggeration but shiflett won say this precisely shiflett doesn need to he is an excellent writer perhaps the best in our field and he does not have to belabor his findings he respects his readers it would be a shame if this proves to be a miscalculation on his part it is significant that the reviewer does not note that this biography also shows louis shores to be idealistic courageous innovative and highly productive one of the corollaries of peterson essential charge is this nor is this a work that interprets shores life psychologically in fact shiflett expertly allows the turbulent emotions of his biographee concerning his jewishness his belief in the paranormal and other subjects to become manifest through well chosen quotes from his fiction and personal letters apparently peterson has missed all this she complains shiflett rarely comments on personality or character flaws and virtues    the blandness of neutrality make the reader long for interpretation it is not interpretation which peterson seems to yearn for it is judgment similarly she charges that shores life is not put into sound context and therefore shiflett denies readers a historical interpretation of shores in fact shores environment is consistently described in detail however peterson does not believe that social context means particular places people and situations but rather sociological psychological and cultural generalizations like urbanization industrialization and the prejudices fears and hopes of the age while social and cultural history predominate in academia these days some still prefer scholarship that sticks close to the facts and does not make grandiose pronouncements based on limited data 
 the library quarterly one example of the supposed lack of social context is the alleged insensitivity to the racial context of shores life where again facts spill forth without meaning and significance both shores and shiflett get a failing grade on the now obligatory race and gender report card alas despite a chapter titled white man which details the racism in american librarianship shores feelings about bigotry and the difficulties of being a northern jew at a southern african american university where he is championing library services to and library education for blacks peterson is displeased shores race and gender privilege allowing for his appointment in  as director of the black college fisk is not analyzed moreover she indicts the biographer for not identifying the race of some of shores colleagues professor shiflett will obviously have to install a highly sensitive racegender checker on his word processing program a short time ago peterson wrote that shores life of color and gender privilege would make for a provocative and interesting sociological biography and contribute to the understanding of the salience of race in american librarianship lorna peterson alternative perspectives in library and information science issues of race journal of education for library and information science  spring   incidentally one could fault peterson for failing to chant the entire mantra race gender and class shiflett view of shores is much broader complex and significant he sees an individual human being not being the book she wanted this biography was doomed from the very beginning in the hands of the ultimate person of privilege in academia the book reviewer this biography of one of the most colorful and significant members of our profession serves its subject and readers well despite peterson statements to the contrary one is shown how louis shores was involved in scores of different aspects of the profession and given a sense of his enormous impact some of it easily discerned and delineated some not carefully researched and beautifully written it manages to be both illuminating and enjoyable this is not only a good read but at  for over three hundred pages in today market it is a good buy stephen karetzky library director felician college library
