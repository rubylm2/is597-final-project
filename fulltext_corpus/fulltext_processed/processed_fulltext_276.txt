effective teacher behaviors in higher education and in us education programs a review of the literature donna m shannon this article examines the literature related to effective teaching behaviors of postsecondary instructors in general and lis educators in particular models for improving instruction in higher education are also considered the conclusion points out that effective teaching is complex and multi dimensional and that attention to specific teaching behaviors should take place within the context of a comprehensive plan for improving teaching and learning attention to the teaching roles and responsibilities of college faculty has increased dramatically in recent years this impetus for improving college instruction has come from a number of influential groups they advocate fundamental reconsideration of faculty responsibilities that will place excellent teaching and improved instruction on a level comparable with research the carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching long time leader in the improvement of higher education has proposed a reconceptualization of scholarship to include a scholarship of teaching as well as a scholarship of research faculty development programs teaching and learning centers and mentoring programs for new faculty have been organized on college campuses across the country monographs journals both discipline specific and educational research journals and newsletters are devoted to the topic of pedagogy in higher education the research on effective teaching includes a variety of perspectives and approaches shulman has taken on the formidable task of reviewing the paradigms or research traditions which have driven the study of teaching over several years and dunkin and barnes reviewed the research specifically devoted to teaching in higher education this body of research has explored variables that impact all teaching situations the variables include characteristics of teachers students and contexts in which teaching and learning occur contextual variables include such factors as size and resource base of the institution teaching space size of class type of discipline cultural milieu of the institution and the community all of which interact to affect the teaching situation in colleges and universities summer  
 journal of education for library and information science about the author donna m shannon is assistant professor college of library and information science university of south carolina results of research on teacher characteristics teaching methods and teaching behaviors contribute to our knowledge of effective teaching and how it affects learning such knowledge provides guidelines for designing faculty development programs and more effective methods of teacher evaluation which have as their primary objective the improved performance of teachers miller and miller have postulated that three competency areas determine the effectiveness of the college teacher they are technical competencies professional competencies and personal competencies technical competencies refer to knowledge of the subject matter together with the skills for its application professional competencies are those areas concerned with theory and practice of teaching and learning such as instructional planning instructional delivery and instructional evaluation personal competencies include characteristics such as attitudes communication skills creativity and a myriad of interpersonal skills research on teaching in higher education has addressed all of these competencies in some form this article examines the literature on teacher effectiveness with a focus on the teaching behaviors of college instructors in general and lis educators in particular methodology and results of research studies investigating lowinference teaching behaviors of college and university instructors are reported and discussed these include process product studies perception studies of effective college teaching and teacher immediacy studies three research based models for the study and improvement of college teaching are described findings from the literature on effective teaching in lis are presented finally the importance of adopting a multi dimensional perspective with regard to the complicated construct of teaching is discussed teacher behaviors much of the research pertaining to student rating of university teaching has been criticized because of its focus on high inference instructor characteristics such as flexibility enthusiasm and clarity in order to assess such high inference teacher characteristics observers must make judgments or inferences these global or abstract constructs as well as overall averages of teaching effectiveness are too vague to provide real help for individual instructors trying to improve their teaching skills research on college teaching effectiveness that focuses on specific low inference teacher behaviors may be more useful to individual teachers and to those who are responsible for faculty development programs low inference behaviors are those specific and discernible actions that can be recorded with little or no inference on the part of the observer examples of such behaviors include moves about while lecturing gives multiple examples and praises students for good ideas the methodologies most commonly employed to study volume  number 
effective teacher behaviors   this dimension of teaching are systematic observation experiments and surveys processproduct studies process product studies look at the relationship between specific teaching behaviors the process of teaching and student outcomes product usually in the form of cognitive gains or affective outcomes researchers collect data in authentic classroom teaching situations or conduct laboratory or field experiments live or videotaped data are collected in a variety of ways including teachers self reports ratings completed by students or ratings completed by trained observers possible products or outcomes of cognitive gains come from scores on content knowledge problem solving ability reading comprehension student self ratings of educational gains and student judgment of overall courseinstructor effectiveness in order to determine students affective development researchers elicit student attitudes toward the course the instructor or the discipline affective outcomes such as student motivation may also be determined by whether students enroll in additional courses in the content area and by student self reports of the amount of time spent studying in actual practice most process product research relies on student ratings of instructional effectiveness in natural or laboratory settings methodological problems sometimes occur in these studies when students serve both as observers of teacher behavior and as raters of overall teaching effectiveness inflation of process product correlations can result in such circumstances results of process product studies overall results of these investigations indicate that low inference teaching behaviors account for a large proportion of variance in effective teaching in college classrooms various research designs have been used to demonstrate that specific teaching behaviors make a significant difference in student attitude student learning and student motivation to pursue further learning observational studies have revealed that dimensions of teaching behavior that are the strongest predictors of instructional effectiveness are enthusiasmexpressiveness clarity and rapportinteraction teacher enthusiasm and expressive behaviors have been found to play a critical role in effective classroom teaching specific expressive behaviors that murray found to be the most highly correlated with student global effectiveness ratings were speaks expressively or emphatically shows facial expressions and uses humor he concluded that such factors are important across all disciplines and influence the effectiveness of other teacher behaviors these behaviors appear to serve as attention getting methods those instructors who engage students attention are more likely to succeed with other effective teaching behaviors similar behaviors identified by other researchers include vocal expressiveness clarity of speech show interest in topic and speaks expressively or dramatically specific behaviors found to impact the clarity factor are uses concrete examples gives multiple examples and stresses important points those behaviors most closely related to the rapportinteraction factor are encourages student participation approves or praises student comments asks questions of the class and addresses students by name observational studies show correlations between teaching behaviors and student outcomes however causal relationships cannot be assumed experimental studies supplement the findings summer 
 journal of education for library and information science of observational studies by confirming or refuting such relationships in a review of experimental studies of low inference teaching behaviors murray concluded that those behaviors associated with enthusiasm and clarity appear to have a cause effect relationship with instructional outcomes generally low inference teaching behaviors e g enthusiasm clarity and interaction account for more variance in student rating of instruction affective outcomes than in objective measures of student learning cognitive outcomes limitations of processproduct studies the relationship between teaching behaviors and student outcomes is not as simple and straightforward as it first appears first teaching behaviors that correlate with one outcome measure may not correlate with other measures those behaviors that correlate with affective outcomes may not correlate with cognitive outcomes conversely behaviors that correlate with cognitive outcomes may not correlate with affective outcomes second few studies of lowinference teaching behaviors have been conducted in contexts other than in the traditional lecture situation and most of them concentrate on undergraduate students third while process product studies reveal that certain effective classroom behaviors are consistent across disciplines in lecture settings one must keep in mind the research on student evaluation of teaching which indicates that student ratings of instruction differ by academic discipline other researchers have found that certain teaching behavior factors differ in frequency of occurrence across academic disciplines even though correlations between particular teaching behaviors and overall student assessment of instructional effectiveness were similar across different academic fields perhaps most importantly shulman warns against process product research that observes teacher behavior without reference to teachers intentions or cognitions oblivious to their contexts and constraints educators should be cognizant of the fact that the results of process product studies alone may not provide dependable guidance for those who seek to improve their teaching techniques observational and experimental studies support the positive relationship between certain low inference classroom behaviors and student outcomes nonetheless drawing generalizations from the results of these investigations is problematic perceptions of effective college teaching college students assessment of effective instructional behaviors and attitudes constitutes a large body of research on teaching in higher education data are collected by asking students to specify characteristics of the ideal teacher characteristics essential to good teaching or characteristics of the students best teachers these studies are broader than the processproduct studies in that they examine characteristics and behaviors exhibited by teachers both inside and outside the classroom overall this research reveals that students and teachers share many perceptions of effective instruction including teacher knowledge of subject and teacher organization and preparation for class perceptual differences between students and teachers do emerge from these studies that is students are far more concerned with teacher enthusiasm and teacher stimulation of interest in the subject or the course while instructors are far more likely to rate as important the teacher ability to provide intellectual challenge volume  number 
effective teacher behaviors   and to stimulate students intellectual curiosity student perceptions in his  synthesis of research into student perceptions of instructional characteristics of effective teachers feldman found that those attributes students most often associated with good teaching or good teachers were stimulation of interest clarity and understandableness followed by knowledge of subject matter preparation for and organization of the course and enthusiasm for the subject matter and for teaching it should be noted that students who participated in these studies were not evaluating a particular teacher or a particular course feldman acknowledges that readers should be cautious in interpreting the results of studies that ask students for their general views on teachers and teaching students assessments of actual teachers within the context of particular courses might be different student and teacher perceptions in a later review of research on studies that collected comparable data from both students and teachers feldman found that the two groups were similar but not identical in their opinions thirty one studies in which teachers and students at the same school were asked about the importance of various dimensions of teaching to good teaching or effective instruction were analyzed for similarities and dissimilarities in student and faculty views across all thirty one studies the average correlation was  indicating substantial agreement between the views of students and faculty on twenty two instructional dimensions when rank ordered the most striking differences in student and faculty views were teacher stimulation of interest in the course and its subject matter rank  for students vs rank  for faculty intellectual challenge and encouragement of independent thought rank  for students vs rank  for faculty and motivating students and setting high standards rank  for students vs  for faculty of the twenty two dimensions faculty and students agreed on three of the four highest ranked dimensions  teacher sensitivity to and concern with class level and progress rank  for students vs rank  for faculty teachers preparation and organization of the course rank  for students vs rank  for faculty and teacher knowledge of the subject rank  for students vs rank  for faculty in a more recent study douglass considered the importance of eight instructional variables as perceived by award winning teachers and their students at one university overall teachers and students agreed on two of the four most important teaching behaviors identified by each group they were being knowledgeable in subject area rank  for students vs rank  for teachers and being well prepared rank  for both students and teachers significant differences between perceptions of students and faculty were found students identified the following variables as significantly more important than did their instructors uses a variety of audiovisual aids uses appropriate instructional material relates knowledge of subject matter to solution of practical problems gives lectures which make it easy to take notes and stresses important points the two instructional variables rated higher by teachers than by students and found to be statistically significant were motivates the student intellectual curiosity and presents thought provoking ideas summer 
 journal of education for library and information science based on the premise that the social dimension of teaching is critical to teaching and learning outcomes walsh and maffei studied student and faculty perceptions of factors affecting the student teacher relationship closedended survey items concerning students perceptions of fairness caring flexibility and trustworthiness were selected from leading college textbooks and journal articles on effective teaching from the student point of view those behaviors which clearly enhanced the student teacher relationship were treats students equally regardless of race or sex learns students names quickly shows patience in explaining points treats students as equals and smiles and displays a friendly demeanor behaviors that students identified as strongly detracting from the studentprofessor relationship were often fails to keep posted office hours or appointments and offers little explanation of grading decisions teacher immediacy studies further empirical support for the importance of the student teacher relationship is found in the instructional communication literature on teacher immediacy behaviors defined as the physical and psychological closeness between people teacher immediacy studies focus on the verbal and non verbal communication behaviors of college teachers that affect their relationship with students though the research in this area is limited investigators have found a relationship between the use of immediacy enhancing behaviors and student perception of their own affective and cognitive learning student motivation however appears to be the primary effect of teacher immediacy behaviors specifically which communication behaviors are important to college teaching in a study designed to identify which specific communication behaviors are important to the prototypical ideal professor and how they ranked with other dimensions of the ideal professor researchers at michigan state university surveyed  undergraduate students enrolled in upper division communication classes in a large university with an open ended questionnaire they found that communication behaviors were important to students of twenty four categories by which data were coded of the prototypical ideal professor identified by the subjects four of the top one third were communication behaviors  good speaker encourages interaction moves about the classroom and uses expressive voice it is interesting to note that both douglass and the michigan state researchers found more student interest in behaviors associated with communication and presentation than did the feldman syntheses in a different approach to the study of teacher immediacy behaviors crump investigated which verbal and non verbal teacher behaviors college students consider to be effective a researcher generated questionnaire that asked subjects to respond to specific behaviors using a likert type scale was administered to seventy students enrolled in communication courses in a community college of the twelve behaviors eight nonverbal and four verbal students rated humor as most important followed by dynamic delivery vocal variation and personal examples models for improving college instruction many observers insist that most college teachers are not well prepared for their responsibilities as pedagogues neither courses nor clinical experiences volume  number 
effective teacher behaviors   devoted to effective teaching are part of their formal education one way research and scholarship devoted to effective teaching has been used to improve the quality of teaching and learning in institutions of higher education is the conceptualization development and use of models described below are three models which provide college faculty with strategies and techniques for self assessment of teaching and for eliciting feedback from others with regard to their teaching two dimensional model lowman two dimensional model of effective college teaching inspired by years of his own empirical research is consistent with his synthesis of research on student satisfaction with professors teaching skills according to this model quality of instruction results from a college teacher skill at creating both intellectual excitement in and interpersonal rapport with students  the kinds of emotions and relationships that motivate them to do their best work the model is based on an assumption that instructors are evenly distributed over each dimension and that most experienced teachers fall at about mid point for each dimension the exemplary teacher is one who excels in at least one of these dimensions and who is adept at both competent teachers are moderately skillful at each dimension dimension i relates to what instructors do in the classroom dimension ii is influenced by student teacher interactions both within and outside the classroom environment factor analysis indicates that dimension i is somewhat more important to students than is dimension ii dimension i intellectual excitement involves the clarity of teacher presentation what is presented as well as stimulation of emotional impact how material summer  is presented instructors who possess a high level of intellectual excitement present well organized content in clear language and emphasize the relationship between concepts and applications they present course material in an engaging way with high energy and strong sense of dramatic tension and they appear to love what they are doing dimension ii interpersonal rapport deals with interpersonal relationships and an instructor communication skills those instructors who rate highest on this dimension exhibit a strong interest in students as individuals and are sensitive to their feelings regarding course content and delivery they encourage students to think for themselves and to express their own points of view lowman suggests many specific strategies and behaviors that college teachers can use to develop their effectiveness in each of the two dimensions for example for dimension i he specifies how to design a course how to organize and present course content how to prepare and deliver exciting lectures and how to conduct class discussions included in his recommendations for improving interpersonal rapport and communications skills dimension ii are suggestions for learning students names being accessible to students and presenting student assignments he offers a checklist and a rating form to elicit feedback from students that can be used to evaluate one teaching based on the model seven principles for good practice developed by a task force of educators and scholars in  the well known seven principles for good practice in undergraduate education incorporate the best from fifty years of research on teaching and learning although based on research on undergraduate
  journal of education for library and information science teaching and learning these principles are applicable at any level of higher education the principles set out the following elements of good teaching and learning  student faculty contact  cooperation between students  active learning techniques  prompt feedback  time on task  high expectations of students and  respect for diverse talents and learning styles to assess conformity with the seven principles chickering and gamson developed two inventories  one for individual faculty members and one for institutions the faculty inventory is intended as a self administered diagnostic tool for use by individual instructors interested in improving their teaching rather than as a summative evaluation or administrative review of a faculty member performance the inventory contains ten statements specific teacher behaviors emanating from each of the seven principles faculty members rate themselves on each of the seventy items using a five point scale individuals can then decide which area to target for improvement case studies and vignettes have been published based on the seven principles a five step process for improving teaching maryellen weimer suggests that improving college teaching requires a balance between individual and institutional efforts institutions she insists must stimulate and support faculty in their individual efforts to become better teachers her model for better teaching intended for use by individual college instructors is a five step process weimer points out that college teachers most often take a hit or miss approach to improving instruction instead she encourages college teachers to be systematic and to view the process as ongoing her model includes the following steps  developing instructional awareness  gathering information  making choices about changes  implementing the alterations and  assessing the alternatives first teachers should develop a clear understanding of their current instructional practices as well as the assumptions they hold about teaching and learning weimer suggests that teachers can do this by viewing videotape of their own teaching using checklists inventories or other evaluation instruments reading articles and talking with colleagues about teaching practices second instructors should use multiple methods to acquire input on their teaching including the solicitation of ongoing feedback from colleagues and students this feedback should include information based on observations of faculty members teaching as well as perceptions of the impact of their instructional policies and practices observers should also make suggestions for other ways teachers can reach their instructional objectives third instructors make decisions about what to change and which alternative strategies and methods to implement including how and when to make changes fourth faculty members implement planned changes by integrating new or revised practices into instructional activities finally teachers evaluate new practices in order to determine the effects of the changes and to decide if additional modifications or revisions are appropriate weimer believes that the responsibility for instructional improvement is clearly the individual teacher however she points out that institutions are responsible for communicating high expectations for instructional quality and for providing support and resources necessary for faculty to improve as teachers volume  number 
effective teacher behaviors    library and information science education library and information science educators will find scant information on effective teaching behaviors when they examine their own body of literature although there are many available publications devoted to lis curriculum to the impact of technology on lis education and to teaching methods in particular there is no empirical research that specifically addresses effective teacher behaviors yet it is interesting to note that jesse shera in the foundations of education for librarianship pointed out that a good teacher must communicate with enthusiasm for learning and with mastery of the knowledge to be communicated two indicators of good teaching consistently found in the literature on effective college instruction shera contends that there are no generally accepted criteria for the identification of those qualities which make for success in teaching but he identifies what he refers to as four maxims defining generalized characteristics of the successful teacher  competence in the appropriate subject  effectiveness of verbal communication  a sincere concern with perhaps even dedication to teaching and  a genuine liking for students coupled with an understanding of their problems and points of view in his  study of library education conant offered the following list of qualities that the ideal educator in a graduate program of library science should possess a distinguished background in librarianship andor in scholarly work including a mastery of the several areas of librarianship these are the generalists proven effectiveness in graduate instruction ability to apply theory to practice and to encourage in students a conceptual approach to problem solving skill in utilizing libraries as laboratories for instructional purposes like shera and conant gorman acknowledges that effective lis educators are knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their subject area organized effective communicators and are approachable and caring but gorman goes further with his consideration of effective teaching insisting that there is a catalyst at work in those truly effective teachers something which causes knowledge attitudes and personality to fuse in an unfailingly creative and responsive way that appeals to students this catalyst according to gorman is made up of the attitudes and personal characteristics of the teacher as well as the practical teaching methods employed by the instructor although gorman does not discuss low inference teaching behaviors he does encourage lis instructors to remain active as researchers and to update their past lis work experience by regular and lengthy forays into the market place effective teaching behaviors of instructors in programs of library and information science is unmapped territory most research in this area has been conducted with full time undergraduate students in lecture situations few studies address teaching effectiveness in professional schools and colleges because there is evidence to suggest that certain specific teaching behaviors are effective regardless of student age and experience or teaching context the results of these studies can offer some guidance to lis instructors striving to improve as teachers perhaps even more helpful to lis faculty would be a body of research conducted with graduate students in professional schools in which various teaching methodologies are employed summer 
  journal of education for library and information science conclusion and a cautionary note a wide range of variables impacts teaching and learning in higher education settings effective teacher behavior is one of many these variables include student characteristics and motivation teacher characteristics institutional characteristics and resources teaching methods and teaching behaviors even though research has identified a number of effective teaching behaviors weimer reminds college instructors that what may be effective for some may be ineffective for others for this reason few if any teaching behaviors are uniformly good or bad in their effect effective teaching behaviors interact with each other and with a myriad of other factors to affect teaching and learning gorman refers to this same theme in his article on lis education in his discussion of a teaching catalyst which he says cannot be defined or dissected objectively    effective teaching is more than technique effective teaching is a complex and multidimensional construct that is unpredictable ambiguous contextual and value laden  a journey into uncertainty therefore it is important to view the teaching enterprise from multiple perspectives  effective teaching behaviors being but one current thinking about teaching responsibilities of faculty in institutions of higher education includes a growing interest in and conversation about reflective teaching schòn wrote about the importance of reflection in action thinking about how we know what we know about what we are doing the reflective process involves seeing things from a variety of perspectives and viewpoints palmer calls on educators to stop privatizing teaching and instead to engage in creative conversation about good teaching these notions are consistent with what is recommended in current models for improving teaching and call on teachers to question their assumptions about teaching to reflect on what and why they do what they do and how what they do affects their students and to engage in a range of activities in order to improve teaching and learning recognizing and discussing specific effective teaching behaviors is one piece of the puzzle these behaviors will be most effectively integrated into what teachers do when they are part of a comprehensive plan for instructional improvement that addresses the total context of teaching and learning references  association of american colleges perspectives on teaching from ntegrity in the college curriculum a report to the academic community college teaching     national institute of education involvement in learning realizing the potential of american higher education washington dc us government printing office   ernest l boyer scholarship reconsidered priorities of the professoriate princeton nj carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching   for a review of these materials see maryellen weimer the disciplinary journals of pedagogy change  novdec     lee s shulman paradigms and research programs in the study of teaching a contemporary perspective in handbook on research in teaching ed merlin c wittrock new york macmillan    lee s shulman research on teaching a historical and personal perspective in effective and responsible teaching a new synthesis ed fritz k oser andreas dick and jeanluc patry san francisco jossey bass    michael j dunkin and jennifer barnes research on teaching in higher education in handbook on volume  number
