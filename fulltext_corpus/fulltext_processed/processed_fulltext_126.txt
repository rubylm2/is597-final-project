historical research as critical practice and relationship  critical research for most of the twentieth century the prevailing style of lis discourse has used technical and administrative language to describe and analyze sys tems oriented problems such discourse starts from a position of relative institutional stability it assumes for example that we know what schools libraries and information systems are and for what they are intended techno administrative research has an important role to play in situations upon which the contours of institutions are widely agreed when consensus about the why questions already exists or when one group in society is sufficiently powerful to impose its definitions on the rest little support can usually be found for asking why questions in any extended manner an swers to those questions can be assumed allowing researchers to begin an swering how questions the central issue becomes one of how to realize these established goals and how to evaluate them in the techno adminis trative tradition efficiency and effectiveness are key criteria much though not all research in lis has traditionally fallen into this category and includes topics such as the design and implementation of informa tion systems the study of managerial techniques in libraries the applica tion of psychological perspectives to human computer interaction and indeed almost all user studies in other words it works within a spe cific relatively stable institutional context to solve technical or manage rial problems related to the operation of the specific institution or organization however when for whatever reason that consensus no longer exists or when hegemonic or coercive control over definitions finds itself seriously challenged then why questions bubble to the surface influencing the struggle for a new control or consensus stability can no longer be as sumed major change is under way if there is any consensus about libraries in the early twenty first century it is that they are in process of major change favored candidates for causes of this instability include the spread of digital technology the erosion of the public sphere in favor of privatiza tion the rise of global market capitalism and a shift toward multicultural ism and diversity for assessing these competing claims or simply for analyzing what is occurring the techno administrative research model is inadequate when the future information landscape is uncertain research ers need to step back from the concerns of local organizations and look crit ically at the scene in its entirety in the last two decades the term critical has become fashionable in lis discourse that critical thinking for example is a component of infor mation literacy has become a truism while the provenance of the term is hard to trace it is clear that at least some lis researchers trace its lineage to the critical theorists of the early and the later frankfurt school the work of these scholars has varied in emphasis and indeed diverged in significant ways but important common strands include linking themes of ideology and power with what they were among the first to call the cultural indus
