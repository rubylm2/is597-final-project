intellectual freedom lectures and the dilemma of offense free teaching ann curry teaching intellectual freedom concepts to library and information science students has become increasingly problematic due to faculty university administration and student confusion about what constitutes sexual harassment and racial discrimination and what the boundaries of academic freedom may be discussion of intellectual freedom issues often centers on issues such as homosexuality and racial hatred which may cause student discomfort and embarrassment disagreement about the parameters of university racial and sexual harassment codes and ambiguity of language within these codes can lead to students misinterpreting intellectual uneasiness as harassment an examination of codes from universities with ala accredited library and information science programs reveals the weaknesses in these codes and the lack of protection afforded to those teaching controversial topics during the past few years university administrations have found it increasingly politic to formulate policies on racial discrimination and sexual harassment that govern the relationship between faculty and students as with most new policies the university community has encountered difficulties in interpreting what is meant by sexual harassment racial innuendo inappropriate speech etc in actual application the development of workable policies satisfactory to all constituents has been further complicated by extremist positions that activists on both sides have tended to adopt as initial bargaining positions some students and faculty members interpret racial and sexual issues to encompass a very broad domain of potentially offensive material even basic course content not originally targeted by policy formulators has become enmeshed in the debates with universities more sensitive than in previous decades to minority group rights and the exploration of personal feelings coming to mean more than the examination of ideas teaching intellectual freedom concepts to library and information science students has become more precarious than kister described a generation ago students professors and administrators are buffeted by power shifts affecting their interaction the professor is clearly no longer in control students have gained greater rights in decision making and redress and formerly marginalized groups notably women and racial minorities are demanding that courses address their particular educational concerns and are being heeded the university is strengthened by changes winter  
 journal of education for library and information science about the author ann curry is assistant professor school of library archival and information studies university of british columbia vancouver this paper was presented at the  alise conference that eliminate harmful sexual and racial behaviors and achieve greater inclusiveness within the curriculum and teaching methods however promoting these changes becomes harmful when students are allowed to equate intellectual or emotional discomfort with the crime of harassment and when as a result course content and teaching methods are censured in the name of sexual and racial equality this paper examines the difficulties of teaching intellectual freedom topics to students in ala accredited programs of library and information science in this changing climate it examines in particular the influences of sexual and racial harassment policies adopted by their universities specific concerns in june  a consultant report charged that long standing pervasive racism and sexism existed within the department of political science at the university of british columbia ubc the report cited a broad range of student complaints about unnamed professors including unwanted sexual attention racial and gender inequities inappropriate teaching styles and damaging comments about students lack of academic ability the university president immediately implemented all the report recommendations including suspension of graduate admissions to the department many faculty members strongly protested this latter move saying that the charges were unproven even in the report and the nature of some complaints posed a threat to academic freedom the suspension was subsequently lifted after the department and the dean of graduate studies reached a formal agreement in a number of areas including structures and procedures for addressing racially and sexually oriented complaints the basic issue however is still far from resolved the substance intensity and divisiveness of faculty and student discussions during this continuing campus wide crisis  and the disturbing tenor of student comments recently received by the author  suggest that much confusion exists about what constitutes unacceptable pedagogical practice professors are urgently concerned about how best to teach controversial topics as an illustration of the difficulties of applying intellectual freedom philosophies and policies the author has given first year students case studies to read and discuss in class one case involves community protests over an aids awareness library display that included photographs of condoms syringes and gay couples embracing in the lively discussions that follow students voice diverse opinions about library roles and responsibilities the effectiveness of shocking or offensive displays and the risks and consequences of insulting library customers after one particular class two students privately voiced concerns to the author one whose strong religious beliefs do not include acceptance of homosexualvolume  number 
intellectual freedom lectures  ity was very disturbed by fellow students critical comments about fundamentalist christian beliefs and complained that the discussion caused discomfort and created a difficult learning atmosphere the other who had previously disclosed to the professor hisher homosexuality was upset because the subject chosen for the case study singled out gays and lesbians as a problem group and opened the possibility for negative comments about promoting a gay lifestyle the student felt harassed although no student directed personal comments at this student or any other the author held lengthy private discussions with each student which appeared to calm their concerns and dissuade them from pursuing a more formal complaint these and similar if less specifically directed complaints have caused this academic who is still untenured to be wary and uneasy when teaching contentious topics the terms that the students usediscomfort difficult learning atmosphere and harassment  appear in many university codes of proscribed practice and these complaints can lead to an instructor suspension such incidents tempt one to teach in a far less open manner to bowdlerize the intellectual freedom lecture in  dr bowdler expurgated sexual and religious allusions from shakespeare plays so they could be read aloud without offending family members of any age nearly two hundred years later it is distressing that professors consider repressing controversial and possibly offensive subject matter so that no student may complain about being offended why teach intellectual freedom the apparent problems with the subject of intellectual freedom prompt questions about the advisability of teaching it at all and in fact this point was raised at a recent university sponsored workshop on sexual harassment at ubc following the report described above this is not a new question berninghausen strongly supported inclusion of intellectual freedom in the curriculum in  he believed that professors of library science have a responsibility to persuade students that they have chosen a profession that commits them to the principle of intellectual freedom he further maintained that many incoming students do not appreciate the significance of free inquiry and therefore faculty members must impress upon students the need for open scholarship if humanity needs are to be met kister who in  offered the first library school course devoted primarily to intellectual freedom decried the ready willingness of working librarians to violate ala policies on censorship he advocated more effective teaching of intellectual freedom to instill a toughness an assertiveness and a combativeness that would enable graduates to hold firm when faced with censorship challenges shuman also felt strongly that students who lack an awareness of intellectual freedom issues are ill prepared for the emotional intensity of customer complaints his  survey of ala accredited schools revealed however that not all faculty members were as supportive of including intellectual freedom in the curriculum nine percent of responding faculty disagreed strongly disagreed had no opinion or were undecided about its inclusion while those remaining were in agreement or strong agreement more recent writers on this subject woodward and white place the teaching of intellectual freedom concepts within the broader context of ethics the former focuses on deontological and consequential reasoning processes winter 
 journal of education for library and information science the latter emphasizes the painful friction students experience when they must confront contradictory personal professional and employer values while these educators endorse the direct inclusion of intellectual freedom in the curriculum each recognizes as well the troublesome questions associated with the subject perhaps these concerns explain the lack of total faculty commitment to the topic shown in shuman survey for example  is it acceptable to challenge personal values and beliefs when teaching intellectual freedom  if an instructor describes a specific action such as censorship as either right or wrong is this not an unbalanced promotion of one personal view of society  isn today librarianship becoming just a neutral exercise in the technological expertise of information handling using computers  aren censorship and free access equally valid ways of handling information and doesn the responsibility for applying one of them belong to one employer  is intellectual freedom a subject for intellectual examination at all or is it just politics does language matter some writers claim that conservative traditionalists have created a non existent political correctness monster in order to discredit any change in university curricula they discount a perceived threat to intellectual freedom by claiming that accusations of political correctness are largely being used by professors to avoid even the remotest engagement with the claims of discrimination advanced by those seeking change these critics of conservatives do not fear that changes will threaten free speech rather they worry that the opponents of change are becoming increasingly defensive and obsessive in their defense of old curricula and thus are advocating a closed restricted and limited intellectual inquiry opposed to anything new and different but others are more sanguine about the recent changes in universities although they applaud the increased pluralism in the student body and curriculum equity programs based on race and gender and the encouragement of a multiplicity of voices in debates they nevertheless fear that along with such changes have come crippling obsessions with words and a dangerous belief in the primacy of student selfconfidence they feel that present emphases move the university away from an arena in which real debate and action are possible into a linguistic world in which substantive concerns are abandoned for a focus on what one labels people and whether or not they are sufficiently comfortable political correctness often appears to tell one what to say  and by implication perhaps what to think  and in so doing does impose restrictions on the development of knowledge through totally free debate the chosen method of instruction in universities for centuries as a result a creed that was supposed to embody tolerance has come to represent intolerance for both faculty and students the anxiety not to be thought judgmental has developed into a rejection of all judgment for fear of causing offense or denying people their rights campus codes on racial and sexual harassment and discrimination university level codes that might affect the teaching of intellectual freedom in volume  number 
intellectual freedom lectures  programs of library and information science were requested from all alaaccredited schools the request was first directed to the universities and produced limited results requests subsequently made by e mail and fax directly to library school deans and directors resulted in twenty nine of fifty seven schools sending information about codes andor copies of the codes themselves four additional codes were secured through an internet search the thirty three codes were analyzed to determine what sections of these codes might possibly be applied to inhibit the teaching of intellectual freedom sources of particular policy quotes are indicated in parentheses the following factors emerged psychological environment policies frequently describe a desirable or undesirable psychological environment for example an essential part of our mission is the provision of an academic environment in which all of our students and faculty are encouraged and supported in the advancement of learning and in which intolerance sexism and bigotry have no place alberta    the university is committed to maintaining an educational and working environment free of conduct which degrades or subjugates employees or students clark atlanta it is the policy of the university to provide a safe and comfortable learning and working environment for students and employees hawaii sexual harassment refers to comment or conduct of a sexual nature    when it is intended to or has the effect of creating an intimidating or hostile environment british columbia many american university policies are based on the us equal employment opportunity commission definition of sexual harassment the definition proscribes conduct that creates an intimidating hostile or offensive working environment  universities frequently add the word academic to the commission description of a working environment the major concern with policies that prescribe desired environments is that a comfortable learning environment is virtually antithetical to effective discussion of intellectual freedom according to kister and white good teaching of this subject requires the broadening of students perspectives by challenging their opinions and prejudices especially through the use of case studies kister describes non confrontational risk free learning sessions in which the professor waves around the library bill of rights as intellectually insulting and debilitating he says this well meaning but shallow method never succeeds in developing in students a critical awareness of the professional commitments associated with complex censorship controversies instead he recommends an uninhibited airing of ideas and an in depth examination of sexual expression and obscenity including examples of pornographic materials white also endorses a disputatious method in teaching intellectual freedom provided it remains civil he encourages professors to play devil advocate during case study discussions by challenging and questioning everything students say to make them justify opinions and recommended actions overall neither the subject matter eg pornography race ethics nor the pedagogical methods described contribute to a comfortable learning environment making intellectual freedom courses taught in this way vulnerable to censure if such an environment is mandated winter 
 journal of education for library and information science the second weakness in codes describing environments is that few provide examples of what constitutes a hostile or offensive environment distinction is rarely made between an environment that is generally deemed offensive at the societal level and one which an individual student finds personally offensive for example because of religious beliefs an anglican student may perceive as hostile a class discussion of the attempts actually made by some british anglican congregations to limit the number of nonchristian books in their local public library university policies should clarify that an intellectually discomforting classroom is not a hostile environment and that the latter term generally applies to such external elements as obscene gestures and displays of obscene material unrelated to course content respect difficulties may also arise with the interpretation of the word respect which appears frequently in policies for example relations among all persons should be characterized by mutual respect and equality florida state the university educational mission is promoted by professionalism in facultystudent relationships and professionalism is fostered by an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect north carolina chapel hill all ubc students staff members and faculty share responsibility for promoting a learning environment of mutual trust and respect british columbia respect is defined by webster rd international dictionary as high special or deferential regard esteem and honor although a laudable quality to uphold respect as defined may be narrowly interpreted to mean respect for the ideas themselves rather than the right to express them if respect is narrowly defined university codes may hamper effective interaction during an intellectual freedom debate respect must exist on various levels within the classroom respect for the professor and fellow students as individuals is necessary for any discussion respect for the rules of the forum which may include no name calling derisory comments or raising of voices should be expected and respect for the right of others to express their views is critical however the university should not require professors and students to show high regard and honor for the ideas of those with whom they disagree only in an atmosphere where students can express vigorous disagreement is free and open debate about controversial ideas fostered during a give and take debate they learn to assign different values to various beliefs and attitudes while one hopes examining their own perceptions about intellectual freedom issues the pratt institute code states that the university cherishes the diversity represented by our people their disparate values and ideas the statement itself is valuable for defending intellectual freedom class content but is limited in this and other codes prescriptions for respect should be modified with statements that encourage polite but structured discussion of disparate values and ideas and also clearly state that while respect for individuals and the rules of debate is expected respect for ideas is contingent on their merit harassment many policies noted the difficulties with defining harassment to clarify the term some list examples of actions volume  number

 journal of education for library and information science statements within codes that regulate actions and speech these statements generally attempt to distinguish actions associated with the wider scholarly mission of a university from actions subject to harassment and discrimination charges including an academic freedom statement in a code dealing with harassmentdiscrimination shows clearly that a university recognizes the potential misuse of the code to curtail teaching and research in addition stating the importance of academic freedom to the university mission and defining the parameters of that freedom help to define by exclusion what constitutes unacceptable speech and teaching technique unfortunately only the following five of the thirty three policies examined contain substantive statements in this area within or juxtaposed to the harassment discrimination policy syracuse university strongly supports and protects the principle of academic freedom all members of the university community have a right to discuss controversial subjects and to express ideas with which some or most of the members of the community strongly disagree sexual harassment is not about voicing unpopular ideas syracuse it is not intended to infringe upon constitutionally guaranteed rights nor upon academic freedom louisiana the university also is committed to the principles of free inquiry and expression members of the university community have the right to hold vigorously defend and express their ideas and opinions to flourish or wither according to their merits respect for this right requires that students tolerate expression of views that they find abhorrent texas austin no limitation shall be placed upon the teacher and librarian freedom of exposition of the subject in the classroom or library or on the expression of it outside    respecting students as individuals the teacher seeks to establish a relationship of mutual trust and adheres to the proper role as intellectual guide and counselor  the teacher makes every effort to foster honest academic conduct    protects their students academic freedom and serves as an example of the principle by assuring that each student and colleague is free to voice opinions openly and to exchange ideas free from interference indiana neither this discrimination and harassment policy in general nor its definitions in particular are to be applied in such a way as to detract from the right of faculty staff and students to engage in the frank discussion of potentially controversial matters such as age race politics religion sex and sexual orientation these are legitimate topics and no university policy should have the effect of limiting discussion of them or of prohibiting instructional techniques such as the use of irony the use of conjecture and refutation or the assignment of readings that advocate controversial positions provided that such discussion and instructional techniques are conducted in a mutually respectful manner british columbia recommendations the introduction of new or revised university policies on sexual and racial harassment discrimination and the difficulties experienced by students professors and university administrators in interpreting those policies should alert those who teach controversial and possibly offensive subjects that they may be challenged bowdlerizing one course or merely waving the ala or canadian library association bill of volume  number
