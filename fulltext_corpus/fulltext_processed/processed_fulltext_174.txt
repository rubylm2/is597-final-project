doctorate recipients in library science how they compare with doctorate recipients in other disciplines patricia g reeling characteristics of doctorate recipients in library science were compared with those in other disciplines to identify factors that may aid in the recruitment and retention of phd students in library and information science programs factors explored include  trends in the annual production of doctoral degrees  characteristics of lis doctorate recipients including gender race citizenship undergraduate major institutions of higher education attended median age median length of time taken to complete the doctorate and postdoctoral plans and  differences between those library science doctorate recipients planning to teach and those planning other professional careers data were derived from a special tabulation of the national research council annual survey of earned doctorates   interviews with deansdirectors responsible for administering library and information science doctoral programs were also conducted to ascertain what they consider to be major challenges facing them in regard to recruitment and retention of doctoral students at their own institutions a key factor affecting the capacity of a library and information science program to flourish in an academic setting is its ability to attract outstanding faculty who are both qualified to conduct research and enthusiastic about educating the next generation of librarians and information specialists for the past several years however educators have expressed concern that there may be developing a shortage of individuals with the doctorate who will be available to teach in library patricia g reeling is an associate professor of communication information and library studies at rutgers university new brunswick new jersey this paper presents the outcome of the  alise research award project fall  
journal of education for library and information science and information science programs in this country barbara moran university of north carolina chapel hill noted in her report on the  alise conference another impending personnel shortage was evident at this year conference schools of information and library science may themselves be facing a shortage of faculty members in the near future mirroring the general trend in academia a greying of library faculty has occurred with many retirements expected in the next few years what is not clear is whether there will be enough qualified library educators to replace those retiring since a large number of library and information science phds go into library administration rather than teaching there may indeed be a shortfall for those schools attempting to recruit new faculty at the conference the shortfall appeared to have already arrived there were fewer candidates interviewing for teaching positions than schools seeking new faculty the same situation occurred the following year when at the january  alise conference only twenty six candidates were available to fill more than fifty faculty openings no doubt shoptalk among conferees at both the  and  meetings served to make doctoral education and recruitment of phd students the focus of alise preconferences in  and  even in  despite the economic recession deleterious impact on higher education in general as well as the threatened closing of still more library schools deans and directors continued to cite the shortage of faculty as a major problem the american library association has also been concerned about a potential shortage of library school faculty at hearings held by the us department of education in november  richard m dougherty ala president testified in support of title iib fellowships for doctoral students we will need faculty capable of doing research the profession of library and information studies has fewer than  persons holding doctoral degrees a larger than average proportion of librarians will reach retirement age through the year  fully  percent of the approximately  library school faculty in this country are  years of age or older  percent are  or over in the fall of   doctoral students were enrolled the majority in librarianship or information science but some in cognate fields of the   were foreign leaving  in the probable pool for faculty of us and canadian schools an assumed completion rate of  percent which is on the generous side leaves  available doctorates generally over half of those who receive the doctorate go into library administration not teaching assuming that  percent of the  would be interested in library education  persons would be looking for a teaching position in fall  the accredited graduate library education programs made  appointments thus there are and will be more slots than people to fill them certainly the library and information science field is not unique in prospects for faculty in the arts and sciences a study of factors affecting demand and supply  to  authors william g bowen former princeton al volume  number

doctorate recipients in library science who found it necessary to accept full time employment and then failed to complete their dissertations lack of availability of research funds also made it difficult to expose phd students to the research process indeed over and over the administrators cited adequate finances as the biggest challenge impacting their doctoral programs in the next five years recruitment and retention of quality faculty was cited as the number two challenge reasons attributed to a declining interest in a teaching career ranged from the most popular starting salaries are too low for our mature graduates with years of professional experience to concern that students see too many of the problems associated with the tenure process also at those schools lacking undergraduate programs in library and information science administrative barriers erected by the graduate schools often made it next to impossible for doctoral students to get actual classroom experience teaching in the mls program some recommendations   for future planning it would be desirable to have a longitudinal survey of library science doctorate recipients in order to track their employment and research records such longitudinal surveys are regularly conducted by the national research council but library science doctorate recipients are no longer included   alise might also consider conducting an annual placement survey including salary information of new doctorate recipients with special emphasis on identification of factors influencing their choice of employment andor postdoctoral study the survey should also seek to elicit salary information   a more concerted effort needs to be made to secure funded research opportunities that will permit both faculty and doctoral students to work in an exciting research environment likewise opportunities to participate in interdisciplinary research on individual campuses need to be explored in a concerted effort to place in the mainstream facultystudents and to make small library and information science programs visible if research with a practical application was supported by state and local libraries the resulting funds could also help to support a doctoral student and allow that student to attend school on a full time basis finally opportunities for postdoctoral study  both for students and faculty  need to be developed  library and information science faculty need to convince promising mls students to enter doctoral programs earlier rather than after years of professional experience one recommendation would be to encourage library schools to identify their best and brightest prospects for phd study while the students are still completing their mls degrees faculty followup and mentoring fall  
journal of education for library and information science might be conducive in persuading these students to enter a doctoral program especially since deans and directors are convinced that personal contact with m l s students and alumni is the most effective method to recruit doctoral students  faculty must find ways to reduce the amount of time library and information science doctoral students spend in graduate study unless library schools want to continue their record of having mature alumni who take the most time to complete their degrees  to encourage doctorate recipients to teach ways must be found to involve them in the teaching process for instance a three hour session on  onsidering teaching as a career might be made a requirement of the doctoral program students also need faculty mentors to help them develop as teachers in those campuses where graduate school regulations prohibit phd students from teaching at the master level and where the library school does not have an undergraduate program faculty should consider aggressively seeking opportunities for their doctoral students to teach courses in information handling or information literacy for other schools on campus doctoral students also might teach in the university library bibliographic instruction program references and notes  b b moran  lise can greying faculty shape policy a report on the library educators conference in san antonio american libraries  mar     statement of r m dougherty president elect american library association at hearings held by the us department of education on reauthorization of the higher education act of  nov   p  ibid dougherty credits his information to j robbins analysis of data from the library and information science education statistical report  timothy sineath ed association for library and information science education sarasota fla   w g bowen and j a sosa prospects for faculty in the arts and sciences a study of factors affecting demand and supply  to  princeton nj princeton univ pr   see the following front page articles in the chronicle of higher education big faculty shortages seen in humanities and social sciences sep   universities must lead the effort to avert national shortages of phd  jan   faculty job market slowly improving evidence indicates more people in phd programs employment listings multiply apr   and job market begins predicted turnaround survey indicates many colleges find it difficult to fill faculty vacancies july    j h drms universities must lead the effort to avert impending national shortages of phd  the chronicle of higher education  jan   bl  p g reeling undergraduate women as potential recruits to the library profession in the status of women in librarianship ed k heim new york neal schuman     p g reeling the new generation of librarians what they are like and how to recruit them new jersey libraries  fall     f zipkowitz and e futas preliminary results of a survey on faculty replacements in accredited library schools in the united states and canada unpublished paper univ of rhode island graduate school of library and information studies june  see also futas and zipkowitz the faculty vanishes library journal sept   p    j p danton doctoral study in librarianship in the united states college and research libraries  nov     g marco doctoral programs in american library schools journal of education for librarianship  summer     volume  number
