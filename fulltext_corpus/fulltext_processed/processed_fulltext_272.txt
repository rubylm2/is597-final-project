the scholar looks at inter library co operation theodore c blegen t he scholar is not an emersonian abstraction he is not a machine nor is he a gaunt and lonely folklore figure dwelling on an upper floor of a mythical tower of ivory he is a human being selectively trained for his job and doing it in collaboration with others as he probes into his special problems he is informed by and sensitive to a thousand influences past and present deny to him the fruits of thought and discovery and invention through past ages and you turn him into a derelict cut him off from association with colleagues whether speaking through their physical voices or through the pages of their recorded thought and you rob his work of its vitality limit his freedom of access to and use of the materials supplies equipment and background information for his research and you cripple his efforts he is instructed by the past and invited by the future as emerson says but he is also aided or hindered by the present aided if his working conditions are good hindered if they are bad never the forlorn and isolated figure that legend has made him out to be he is today more sharply aware than ever before of the importance of working with others this has been forced upon him by his own specialization the interconnections of science the tendency of problems to overlap conventional disciplines and the importance of relating the part to the whole for himself the scholar may paraphrase the english poet and preacher john donne and say no scholar is an island entire of itself every scholar is a piece of the universe a part of the mainland of human search for truth in all its manifold interrelations and so the american scholar today is joining research teams tackling cooperative enterprises building bridges to other disciplines and exploring the interstitial areas no emphasis upon or trend toward co operation can ever lessen the need for original thinking and individual intellectual integrity but the compulsions of human understanding coupled with the nature of modern scholarship point to an ever greater reliance upon community effort in scholarship with one skill buttressing another in the effort to solve problems in the complex and interwoven human and natural universe thus scholarship embracing the spirit and using the techniques of co operation is leaguing itself with the futureto use the words of ibsen and this is a part of the setting of the dramatic interlibrary venture that universities and libraries of the middle west are here initiating but only a part for looming up behind this enterprise and informing the mood of contemporary scholarship is a conviction that research is critical to our future of vital urgency and in need of every support within our power we know all too well that with our land frontiers subdued unconquered frontiers scientific social economic humane educational confront  a paper presented at the dedication ceremony of the midwest inter library center on october   
ia the library ouarterly us research is unquestionably the pioneering of the modern age we know also that in the dark shadow of two world wars and in the shade or sunlight of far reaching new scientific discoveries this age is studded with problems as grave in their implications as they seem various and endless nearly everybody pays lip service to research it stirs the imagination and provokes many figures of speech people call it professional lifeblood the opening of new frontiers the invasion of fields the fighting of battles the conquest of visible and invisible enemies a race against time but all too many people think of research as magic and of course magic needs nothing but a wand research is no magic howeverit employs no incantations it has no bag of tricks it is work trained work hard work work done in freedom and it imperatively needs facilities of many kinds including books made accessible by all the means and devices of library science certainly the universities and libraries co operating in this enterprise are under no illusion that scholars produce their results by waving wands they understand that our most vital research need is for fundamental investigation something that congress in its failure to come quickly and generously to the support of the national science foundation shows that it does not understand i cannot take part in this symposium without underlining another need of our time focused upon books and their use this is the need to reinforce and extend the efforts of organized education to communicate the findings of research and reflection to a very wide public an unused library is entombed eloquence and wisdom scholarship that does not ultimately make impact in some form on the public mind is little more than antiquarianism research as edith cavell said of patriotism is not enough not long ago i participated in the corning conference the central idea of which was that our people almost desperately need to absorb and understand the largely unused or undistilled values in the humanities we have rich treasures of mind and spirit that few share our shelves are crowded with books of importance whose message does not reach the people representatives of industry business and the academic world met around conference tables at corning to consider some of these humane values most of them already probed by a scholarship that more often than not wraps its thinking into bundles of jargon the conference believed that these values should be unwrapped and sent out into the life of america today who can say what the next step in the advance of civilization will be it may be a new medicine a new poem a new symphony a workable plan for peace it could possibly be the translation of the best fruits of scholarship notably in the humane areas into the common understanding and possession of millions the task is one for scholarship perhaps an essentially new kind of scholarship and when it is undertaken in full force you may be sure that the books of inter library centers here and elsewhere in the regions of america will be as pure gold to the miner how does the scholar look at interlibrary co operation who can say no  conference on living in industrial civilization held at corning ny may i   this conference was jointly sponsored by the corning glass works and the american council of learned societies as part of the centenary celebration of the corning glass works
the scholar looks at inter library co operation one can speak for all the scholars of the midwest or of america they have no common voice no chosen spokesman and i have some slight doubt that they would acknowledge a dean as their representative particularly a graduate dean who as howard mumford jones has said is the head of a school that does not exist and of a faculty that never meets who does nothing in particular but is subjected to heavy criticism unless he does it very well as chairman of a university library committee i have interested myself for a decade in the library as an integral part of the main line educational program of a university but i suspect that my chief claim if any for voicing the viewpoint of scholars is that i have shared some of their typical experiences et in arcadia ego i have hunted books and manuscripts i have explored libraries and archives i have taken notes to the ultimate the arthritic point i have searched in vain for a book in my own library and then after long reconnoitering discovered a copy of it in the university of illinois not used by anyone for twenty three years i have scouted various european libraries employing their quaint medieval catalogs with silent prayer and a hope that intuition plus american luck would come to my rescue so after such experiences and with a choice collection of frustrations i thank god for some genuine inter library co operation even if the pool for immersion is some four hundred miles from my own campus this inter library center cannot fail to be of service to american scholarship research people now undergoing intensive schooling in the arts of cooperation should welcome a great central pool of materials for their own use with riches pouring into it from fifteen or more co operating institutions they know that with an enlarging niagara of books and documents rushing out from the presses of the world no university can buy or beg or harbor everything if it did and then processed it all the outcome would be the channeling of the entire university budget to the library the faculty uncomfortably left with tenure minus salary there are there must be limitations upon library expansion but these limitations apply to all our libraries no university has an unlimited budget meanwhile there is unnecessary duplication everywhere everywhere there is needless competition everywhere there is unplanned expense in the struggle to meet special needs often of a temporary character everywhere there are research projects for which a given library does not have the necessary materials at hand materials which though they may be duplicated in the little used resources of another library can be built up independently only at substantial expense and with painful delay and it may well be that in some places research projects at least at a certain level now confine themselves mainly to materials immediately available whereas the use of the resources of a central collection reasonably convenient of access might give them more flesh and blood the scholar looking at inter library co operation will i believe hail this center as a desirable pool of research materials for the entire midwestern region he will view it as a potential enrichment of the research resources for the region as a whole available to him and to his students looking to a long future he will see it as steadily growing in productive promise but trained to raise questions in his own research
i the library quarterly province he will pose certain questions about this enterprise will basic decisions on policy be attuned to the true needs of scholarship and education how will books be selected along what lines will the collection be built will university administrations mindful of the economies attendant upon a central pool continue to treat university library budget problems with a sense of urgency and of fundamental educational and research need what delays will be encountered in the use of some obscure item which in the old days might have been found easily and quickly on the university library shelves will there be any appreciable loss to research through the removal of books from customary shelves where in casual inspection a scholar comes across material to which even the best guides might not afford recognizable clues scholars will ask these and other questions not as objections but as cautions and perhaps as guides if the project involves some loss or disadvantage it will be more than offset by gain and advantage my imagination is stirred when i think of fragmentary incomplete little used collections merging with related materials from other institutions and being rounded out and enriched if the center continues to confine itself to little used materials and to serving scholars efficiently through the participating libraries most of the skep ticism if indeed there is any will be blown away if there should occur a delay of a day or two in getting one hand on a book that might have been found in a few minutes in one own library consider the offsetting advantages in quick efficient inter library communication for scores of items in the creation of new bibliographical tools and in the increasing chance of finding not only the particular book wanted but also rare and important associated items perhaps in some instances microfilmed from unique copies are we not moving in the direction of an integrated system of library resources for the entire country with the elimination of unneeded duplicates in regions like the midwest with the filling in of important areas now inadequately collected and with the development of bibliographical controls that surpass anything yet achieved in appraising the center scholarship will give thought to yet other large issues for the future for certain problems of strategy cannot fail to be brought into the light of scrutiny by the lessons of successful inter library cooperation the truth is that unneeded duplication confusion and fragmentary service in the libraries reflect like conditions in the universities on the educational and research fronts cooperation in one segment of inter university relationships invites consideration of its advantageous spread to other segments for research and graduate education this means asking ourselves some probing and possibly disturbing questions what are the values and prospects of joint endeavor are universities spreading themselves too thin do they offer to do more than they can actually do with high competence what can individual institutions do very well and within the limits of their resources can they work out co operative agreements with other institutions such questions are not wholly theoretical to me for i have helped to promote a modest arrangement with a neighboring university for co operation in one field of study with a division of
the scholar looks at inter library co operation  specialization flexible conditions for the intermigration of students joint conferences and an alternating of summer sessions on two campuses but universities thus far have done relatively little to eliminate unrewarding duplication and competition and to advance rewarding joint recognitions or allocations of specialization the problem is difficult for no good university is static universities change their emphases do not remain the same decade after decade and few would argue that they should no co operative plan in research or in education will succeed which does not take into account the viable character of university education its dynamic quality as an ongoing institution its flexible adjustment to changing objectives but perhaps the difficulties are only challenges to our resourcefulness meanwhile this center notwithstanding obstacles that faced the idea a decade ago is a reality stephen vincent benet in the opening line of western star says americans are always moving on today in this dedication we move on to new ground new furrows new crops the job we tackle is one in which we libraries universities scholars work together toward a common harvest as mama says in i remember mama is good
