cardinal franz ehrle in commemoration of a double anniversary e heyse duthtr one hundredth anniversary of franz ehrle birth and the fiftieth i of his entry into the field of library administration received no comment in american library literature american scholars who have had the privilege of doing research in the vaticana and who were helped and befriended by the kindly bibliographic genius that was ehrle would not want his memory to fade and surely the administrator in the library profession should have an even greater interest in ehrle for his name has always suggested eminence not only in scholarship but above all in librarianship it is his accomplishments as a library administrator that will be reviewed at this time that cardinal ehrle was singled out for the directorship of the vatican library fifty years ago at the age of fifty was a stroke of good fortune the difficult position demanded a person who was not only a scholar but also an administrator ehrle was both his sound scholarship came into evidence especially in the seven volumes of the archiv fur literaturund kirchengeschichte ii and in the historia bibliotheca romanorum pontificum tum bonifatianae tum avenionensis i important studies on the avignon period and directly related to the library scene to this period of literary productivity belongs a further enterprise the nine volumes of the bibliotheca theologiae et scholasticae selecta atque composita a fr ehrle sj i  a splendid monument to ehrle bibliographic genius it was the historia however which directed the attention of leo xiii to ehrle the library minded pontiff sensed at once that ehrle had the ability to undertake the reorganization of the vatican library in the manner in which the pope had designed the project that ehrle was properly qualified and really the only one able to execute administrative plans of the prodigious type projected by leo xiii was the conviction also of every member of the congresso direttivo to which ehrle was appointed in i they felt that the huge task of reorganizing the vatican library would meet with success if put in their young colleague hands the years immediately ahead showed that the faith they had placed in the man who had spoken with authority on the problems awaiting solution at the vaticana was wholly justified ehrle saw clearly that the primary problem demanding immediate attention was the consolidation of the printed materials with the manuscript stock and the setting up of a reference collection for users of the library and archive the library board put ehrle rather than the incumbent prefect carini i  in charge of carrying out these important projects since this was an undertaking designed for a man of ehrle age energy scholarship and practicality ehrle reforms at the vaticana got i ehrle record of publications contains ii titles for the period i  
 the library quarterly under way in io and when he became prefect in i much had already been accomplished a major accomplishment was that of moving the printed books kept in the appartamento borgia and consolidating this collection with the main collection of the vatican this suggestion stemmed from ehrle benefactor leo xiii who had given the matter considerable thought the method of moving the collection however as originally suggested did not find favor with ehrle the original plan was to form a line from the appartamento borgia to the new location and pass volume after volume from hand to hand down the line it was thought that the process would require from three to four months ehrle believed that a more effective method should be employed his plan called for fifteen workers within the record breaking time of fourteen days this small crew moved iooo volumes although more steps had to be climbed and descended and a larger distance traversed the vatican collection was moved faster than those in vienna stuttgart kiel and cologne had been ehrle reorganization and modernization of the vaticana made it possible for him to open the long locked doors of the library to the research scholar for whom he also provided a public reference collection assembling the eighty thousand volume biblioteca di consultazione during the period from ii to i and setting it up in the bibliotheca leonina was wholly the work of ehrle the opening of the library to the public and the reference library enterprise easily rank as the most important contributions to vatican library history in the period of leo xiii the name of ehrle is to be linked not only with the bibliotheca leonina but also with the various institute libraries in rome which supplement it from modest beginnings in ii they have developed into important collections when studying ehrle successful administrative career it is important to remember that the prefect entered the field of administration as a novice experience became his teacher a study of the great libraries in other countries with whose administrators he corresponded taught him the art of library administration he pursued his subject in the professional journals studied the new library regolamenti issued by the italian government and found it profitable to learn by actual observation he made the bibliotheque nationale his model here delisle was doing what ehrle was striving after in rome reorganizing the manuscript division to make it more serviceable years of fruitful contact between ehrle and delisle ensued delisle library however was not the only one ehrle visited and studied the large libraries in vienna munich berlin and london were also on his study itinerary while journeying over land and sea from library to library ehrle visualized how one day the vatican library would take its place alongside the world greatest bibliographical institutions if ever the vaticana was to attain to high rank as a service center to scholars ehrle knew he would have to liberalize at once the rules governing its usage consequently he inaugurated a new schedule of library hours providing access from nine to one olock most of the year and from eight to one olock in the summer permitted use of all catalogs and cut the red tape with which scholars had had to contend when seeking permission to use the vaticana treasures even rarities kept in the riserva were made available by ehrle for his library philosophy was
cardinal franz ehrle  founded on the belief that books are for the use of the human race relaxation of restrictions brought a large increase of readers and soon the library facilities were overtaxed it took the ingenuity of an ehrle to solve the vexing problem of space in iio the clever administrator successfully reshaped the plant with the removal of the vatican press to new quarters ehrle took over its former home and remodeled it into a reading room this new and spacious room on the ground floor was all the more useful since it was directly connected with the reference library the three floors directly above served as a stack for the manuscript material as a result stack to reader service was immediately improved ehrle favorite dream of having the archive reference library and reading room on the same floor level and directly connected had at last come true thanks to ehrle the vaticana became a leader in the field of manuscript cataloging that the short title entry had certain merits ehrle never denied but to him serviceability to the scholar was the foremost consideration in cataloging he favored the type of descriptive cataloging detailed in the programmatic statement drawn up at the beginning of his administration and known as the leges quas curatores bibliothecae vaticanae in codicibus latinis recensendis sibi constituerunt ehrle believed that every effort was to be made to ascertain authorship title and if printed the place of publication of every piece of writing concerning a manuscript he realized that a program of such an exacting nature required accurate and comprehensive workmanship and the banishment of speed and haste consequently he was not surprised when during his incumbency only six volumes of the occidental manuscripts reached completion he thought that the cataloging project at the vatican might take from eighty to one hundred years and according to what has been accomplished thus far it appears that his estimate was none too conservative ehrle was in charge at the vatican library at a time when very important collections were being put on the market the prefect successfully carried out the transaction whereby the famous borghese and barberini libraries passed into the hands of the vatican his success in acquiring the borghese and barberini libraries was all the more marked in view of the fact that the prussian government tried hard to gain possession of these treasures the valuable chigi collection also found its way into the vaticana in ehrle day years before other libraries assisted the cause of scholarship by photography ehrle was making materials available by that method he continued to use photography for the preservation of endangered manuscripts in accord with the recommendation of the st gall conference i ehrle however did not establish a laboratory for that purpose in the vatican but commissioned a private photographer whose charges were reasonable to do the work a workshop in many respects more unusual at the time than a photographic laboratory was set up in the vaticana by ehrle in the early nineties far and near librarians were talking about ehrle newest creation the restauro dei codici here clinical attention was given to the priceless manuscripts of the vatican library manuscript conservation at ehrle library was started before the international conference at st gall took up the subject in i by that time various methods of restoration had al
 the library quarterly ready been tried and approved or discarded in ehrle clinic a corps of specialists was constantly at work prolonging the lives of manuscripts by highly developed techniques manuscripts from every country reached the clinic and received the same expert attention that the vatican own priceless possessions did ehrle felt personally responsible for whatever restoration was undertaken he took a personal interest in every manuscript sent to him prescribed its  cure and checked up daily on the progress made it is known that he did not hesitate to approve radical clinical methods if they meant saving a manuscript of extraordinary value conservation of bibliographic riches was uppermost in ehrle mind again when secularization swooped down upon italy and valuable material was rescued and placed in cathedral libraries archives etc ehrle in i sent out a list of instructions dealing with the conservation of this material here in eighteen lucid pages we have ehrle doctrine of library administration in a nutshell known as the forma di regolamento per la custodia e lso degli archivi e delle bibliothece ecclesiasticke these regulations became the library law for the ecclesiastical libraries of italy evidence of modern library thinking in the regolamento of  is found especially in the recommendation favoring unrestricted public use of ecclesiastical book property ehrle would also have extended to other church owned collections the liberal policy put into effect at the vatican like his library minded pontiff who was unafraid to break with the vaticana tradition of library isolationism ehrle was convinced that penetrating research would not be injurious to the catholic church for him no cleavage between faith and learning existed such an attitude then could result in only one thing the establishment of a great service center for scholarship at rome and subsidiary research stations throughout italy at the famous research center presided over by ehrle patrons soon took note of a change in library etiquette ehrle put into practice his belief that there should be a personal contact between the librarian and the reader the prefect of the vaticana stationed himself in the main reading room of his library there to welcome patrons inquire about their research problems and give freely of his counsel this he considered one of his most important duties he filled the role of host admirably and thereby enhanced the reputation of the vatican library immensely with this innovation ehrle took a difficult task upon himself countless inquiries of every type were addressed to him daily during the few hours the public had access to the library everyone the novice as well as the seasoned scholar received friendly attention of course patrons felt that it was a matter of courtesy to confine to a minimum the number of questions addressed to the busy prefect it was possible for them to do so because ehrle library system which provided an abundance of reference facilities enabled the reader to find his own way and serve himself it must have been a rare kind of schooling to work on ehrle staff which toward the end of his incumbency consisted of six scriptores their six assistants eleven bidelli and four bookbinders the scriptores who when joining ehrle staff usually entered upon a lifetime position busied themselves exclusively with cataloging the manuscript holdings their assistants were in charge of the printed books and the reference collec
cardinal franz ehrle  tion the bidilli were employed in the public service branch of the library ehrle the scholar and self trained librarian believed that professional training was necessary for librarianship personal experience led him to this conviction in his statements on policy concerning selection of vatican personnel he emphasized that upper bracket staff members had to have professional training in library science and proper academic training before adopting service measures all of which were carefully thought through and some of which had their incipiency in the recommendations of patrons ehrle listened to the suggestions of his staff and then reached a decision his policies were liberal but he brooked no infringement the strict prefect dealt promptly and severely with transgressors of rules and regulations whether they were patrons or staff members however he never wanted others to suffer because of the penalty which an individual transgressor evoked no library administrator ever held the administrative reins more firmly in hand up to the very end than did ehrle it was at the request of pope pius x that ehrle did not terminate his administrative career in iio as he had hoped to do but four years later instead regardless of the length of time the research scholar spent in ehrle environment he never failed to take with him certain unforgettable impressions even the casual observer would always remember the upright stature of the prefect his sharp and eloquent facial features suggesting strong will power and a keen intellect the penetrating eyes the friendly yet dignified manner in short a personality compelling respect everyone who had contact with him noticed sooner or later that the prefect was a master of human psychology it did not require extended observation to recognize in him the altruistic type of man generous and noble for whom service to his fellow men is both a duty and a joy frequent recognition was accorded ehrle in  he was made a cardinal and by i twenty seven european universities had bestowed upon him their honorary degrees he was a member of the institute de france and of such important academies as those of gttingen berlin munich and vienna on the occasion of the prefect eightieth birthday a testimonial program was arranged in which the pope participated and which was attended by the college of cardinals the diplomatic ambassadors to the vatican the staff of the vaticana representatives of numerous academies and learned societies and scholars from every country the climax of the program came when the pope presented the five volume miscellanea francesco ehrle to which eighty two outstanding scholars including some of the world foremost had contributed among library personalities there have been few like ehrle perhaps leopold delisle is the only modern who can be placed in the same category like delisle cardinal ehrle was a scholar and an administrator a man of learning and a library technician he was also more farsighted than those of his german colleagues who favored the bibliothekar im nebenamt attitude he never considered the position of library administrator a part time one a german by birth and a catholic by faith ehrle belonged to the whole world of scholars irrespective of nationality or creed but since his foremost work comes under the heading of librarianship the library profession can proudly claim him as its own
