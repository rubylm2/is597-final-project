 the library quarterly there has been much scholarship in the past fifteen years on the life experiences of immigrant women that focuses on the intractability of their experience in urban communities during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries limiting the discussion of contact with american culture to work labor activism or the streets historians have written little about clubs and organizations particularly those conducted at the many settlement houses and community organizations across the country which catered to the intellectual lives of immigrants the working class and their children this is partly because of the absence of archival material that reflects the voices of nonelite women and girls karen j blair work on the women club movement  focuses almost exclusively on middle class women clubs while priscilla murolo recent scholarship on working girls clubs  focuses primarily on postadolescent women and labor activism anne ruggles gere  offers a new look at women club activities through a nuanced analysis of the textual practices employed in a variety of club settings including those of elite working class immigrant and minority women on the other hand kathy peiss  and to a lesser degree elizabeth ewen  both focus on dance halls movies and the streets as a major source of recreation for immigrant and working class women and girls participation in the library clubs was a significant alternative to those leisure attractions the clubs were a important venue for intellectual social professional and economic advancement like the later bryn mawr summer school for women workers   and other worker education programs education empowered and emboldened many working class and immigrant women beyond society expectations research into alternative programs like the saturday evening girls offer scholars the opportunity to reexamine the lives of immigrant and working class women and girls and their intellectual aspirations the segs were overwhelmingly native born of immigrant parents who often arrived in the late s and early s though a significant number of segs had older foreign born siblings many of the segs ultimately became middle class housewives a status that represented an enormous improvement over their mothers lives but the richness of their experience in the library clubs also enabled some of the segs to pursue higher education and professional careers many  for a discussion of this phenomenon see    the  united states census of population for the north and west ends of boston has been examined to compile data on the segs and their parents and family members of the sixty five young women located in the census  percent were native and born to immigrant parents they were overwhelmingly russian jews at  percent followed by  percent who were of italian heritage over  percent of the seg parents were foreign born  see also  for individual biographies of some of the women

the saturday evening girls  down from  percent fifteen years earlier  percent jewish  percent anglo and  percent portuguese by  the population of the north end had grown to  with italians representing over  percent of the population in  the population had burgeoned to   percent of whom were italian by then the jews irish portuguese and other ethnic groups had moved out of the north end into other areas of boston including the west end roxbury dorchester and hyde park  pp   the consequences of unrestricted immigration in the late nineteenth century into new england were manifold racial and ethnic groups crowded together in tenement neighborhoods where poverty was pervasive and where immigrants were unfamiliar with the english language and unsure of american social and cultural customs and expectations divided by race class language and religion many immigrants kept within their own ethnic and racial spheres separated by a street corner from another ethnic enclave residential segregation was a fact of life in the north end with italian families dominating certain streets while russian jews dominated others with some multiethnic border streets sprinkled about salem street was one such street populated byjews and italians while stillman street housed mostlyjews and hull street mostly italians in  at least thirty segs lived on salem street alone including four seg families who lived in an apartment building at  salem street  old dilapidated housing overcrowding and inadequate sanitary conditions helped spread disease and ill health among families francis rocchi an seg who went on to run several businesses of her own in portland oregon lived on north bennet street in four crowded rooms with beds in every room toilet in the cellar and plenty of bugs a constant battle  p  according to seg sylvia bacchini the arrival in boston from europe was a confusing frightening and at times a dangerous experience it would be difficult to describe in detail a picture of the people pushing each other at the gang plank to land in this promised land of health wealth and prosperity  p  the lengthy detention process and the examination of luggage and papers were just the beginning of the immigrants reception in the land of opportunity trouble lurked for the unwary reenhorn  and in particular unsuspecting young girls whom kind gentlemen sought to help if the girl knows the world he may be told to attend to his own affairs but on the other hand simple and trusting aliens are often sadly misled  p   the advent of the railway and subway system in boston enabled the growth of suburbs in boston as people could live outside the center of the city and still commute to jobs within the city
 the library quarterly a sense of urgency about the rampant overcrowding of the schools in eastern massachusetts resulting from the tremendous influx of immigrants was palpable during the last quarter of the nineteenth century and the first two decades of the twentieth heavily burdened with thousands of young immigrant children speaking dozens of languages from eastern and southern europe educators scrambled to accommodate and teach them in horribly overcrowded schools children struggled to learn english and the basics of compulsory elementary education boston schools suffered severe space shortages from the s through  creating unacceptable situations where children were turned away because of a lack of facilities  pp   significant language barriers poorly educated parents and economic need also forced many children out of public schools and into the labor force prematurely the reformers of the progressive era recognized the perils of overcrowded neighborhoods and the stress placed on cities and their residents both native born and immigrant through private and public programs and institutions they sought to devise comprehensive ways of dealing with the many issues needs and problems of industrialization and the economic destabilization of the inner cities typically however many reformers also viewed immigrants poverty as a function of their traditions customs and culture by teaching american customs and ways of living they believed immigrants would soon find financial security and improve their quality of life  pp   organizations such as nbsis sponsored many americanization programs in their own facilities and public schools viewed as agents of socialization these programs were also a means of promoting conformity to white protestant middle class values it is clear that as the young segs were pursuing intellectual stimulation they were becoming americanized but the processes were complex and at times contradictory according to milton gordon in assimilation in american life  in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth before world war i americanization programs were moderate enough so that they showed some respect for immigrant culture throughout the period however there were more prosaic instrumental programs of instruction in the use of the english language elementary american history the nature of american government and so on  pp   that ultimately meant the abandonment of these connections to the immigrants place of origin programs throughout  these programs often included classes in english and citizenship where immigrants were taught the basics of american history the principles of a democratic government and civic responsibilities
the saturday evening girls  the city of boston during this time period were no different the nbsis was in some ways particularly sensitive to the cultural sensibilities of its neighbors because of the large number of individual ethnic groups living within the area yet their ultimate goal was economic political and educational vocational assimilation although aware of the process of american assimilation in their lives some segs believed that they had retained their originality and racial traditions in addition to white middle class values and expectations  p  north bennet street industrial school nbsis and educational reform it was during this time period that nbsis developed and refined a variety of manual and industrial training programs to augment the public school programs in the city founded by pauline agassiz shaw in the early s nbsis represented a new trend in the development use and ideology of industrial and manual training during the late nineteenth century in  shaw had been asked by the associated charities of boston to open a kindergarten and nursery school at the north end industrial home a charitable organization established for the benefit of the north end immigrants at  north bennet street influenced by elizabeth peabody mary garland and rebecca weston shaw had already opened two kindergartens in  one in jamaica plain and one in brookline the home provided classes in sewing and laundry to help poor women particularly widows wives with sick husbands and deserted wives  learn necessary skills to earn extra income through piecework paid for by the home by  shaw maintained control of programming at the home expanding and changing its vision to helping not only poor women but their children and husbands as well under the direction of mary hemenway the boston cooking school opened a branch in the building a workroom was outfitted in the basement for carpentry classes for boys and a print shop library and a kitchen garden where young girls twelve to fifteen are instructed in housework were also established  by  the laundry and piecework were discontinued in favor of more expanded manual training programs in woodworking printing clay modeling  pauline agassiz shaw was the daughter of the famous nineteenth century naturalist louis agassiz and the stepdaughter of elizabeth cary agassiz founder of radcliffe college for women in cambridge massachusetts for more information on shaw and her family see   these women were pioneers in the kindergarten movement in the united states and founders of the garland school for training kindergarten teachers in boston
 the library quarterly and leatherwork by  shaw management of nbsis allowed the associated charities to quietly relinquish control of all programming by the turn of the century shaw secular approach was instrumental in nbsis ability to reach into the community and offer its services to the many different cultures and religious groups living there soon courses were developed in cooperation with local private and public schools in boston completely supported by private donations the school maintained programs for public school children throughout the early part of the twentieth century defining a new phenomenon of joint public and private initiatives that provided some manner of education and support for overcrowded underrepresented poor communities it was through club work however that many new ideas of social reform were played out in  nbsis reported that with the growing demand for clubs and classes there is opportunity for more work and more workers more lives might be brightened and ennobled more weary bodies might be rested and refreshed more rough manners made gentle and the work would prove its own reward  p  it was often through clubs that reformers capitalized on opportunities for social intercourse and good citizenship  p  by the turn of the century however maintaining an adequate number of devoted and reliable volunteers became increasingly difficult older volunteers began to give way to young unmarried middleand upper class women who were often not as philanthropic with their available time but were eager for more professional or paying positions through the newly emerging field of social work college trained professionals began to replace the multitude of volunteers that had staffed many charitable organizations throughout the nineteenth century the nbsis for instance actively pursued relationships with the emerging schools of social work in the boston area such as those at simmons harvard boston university emerson mit wellesley and tufts who used the north end location as a suitable site for the hands on training of their schools students radcliffe the winsor school and the women educational and industrial union placed many young girls and women either as volunteers or paid workers nevertheless it was through the multitude of literary debate and athletic clubs for boys and young men and sewing cooking and a few literary clubs for girls and young women that reformers and immigrants often experienced their first cross class and cross cultural exchanges   according to the nbsis minutes of the executive committee november   we have counted upon and secured the support of catholics and non catholics alike and have intentionally ignored the possibility of a religious question concerning our work 
the saturday evening girls  while most clubs for girls generally centered on sewing cooking and other domestic duties some clubs began to emerge that addressed the intellectual needs of girls and young women by the mid to late s nbsis had made a commitment to providing a library facility for the neighborhood it was through this expansion of the library and its reading rooms that a new class of clubs for girls and young women began to take hold and flourish offering girls an alternative club atmosphere to the monolithic domestic skills training clubs for guerrier brown and storrow providing a stimulating educational program through the library clubs recognized and honored the intellectual life of women for women particularly working class and immigrant women intellectual advancement was not a universally accepted concept in an article in charities a social work magazine the plight of the poor was seen largely the fault of poorly trained mothers nobody more than charity workers realize the great necessity for the training of girls in household duties it would probably not be wide of the mark to say that a large number of cases of estrangement between husbands and wives among the poor is due to lack of ability on the part of the wife to make the home comfortable and attractive to cook properly and to sew if the home is to be the center and root of our civilization it must be made a place worth while going to and spending time in it is the girls who must be taught this lesson and aroused to the nobility of their calling  the men and women of thought are realizing the faults of education that looked well to filling the head with facts  by the turn of the century most of nbsis clubs for girls remained devoted to domestic activities drama music and social entertainment there were two embroidery clubs several housekeeping clubs including little housekeepers for girls aged twelve assorted evening social clubs the clover club for older irish girls who were working a current events club a miniature music club and the pauline agassiz shaw club which was established for teaching embroidery beadwork and machine stitching  p  there were only two literary clubs the wiltse club a small club conducted by sara wiltse for young jewish women and the lily of the arno club for italian girls which focused on italian literature  pp   g stanley hall president of clark university in worcester massachusetts prominent child psychologist and early childhood education proponent believed that girls education was ultimately dependent on their sex roles the home should be served by every child who should feel himself a useful and integral member of it with duties every girl should cook sew clean polish and perhaps wash have something to do with flowers develop some domestic taste and pride in place of the shame so often felt by high school girls for their lowly homes for which their education often breeds distaste they
 the library quarterly should be reminded that too soft hands in the young suggest a soft brain that hand and brain both grow and are educated together the kitchen is the heart of the home its industries intelligently understood are among the most educational of all possible influences and to overcome the alienation school often breeds for home life in the modern american girl is one of our most serious problems  it is not surprising then that guerrier storrow and brown were frustrated by the lack of interest in the intellectual advancement of young women guerrier had been deeply influenced by the great literary figures of nineteenth century new england and there is no doubt that she was determined to share this with other young women born in  in new bedford massachusetts guerrier was the granddaughter of daniel ricketson a wealthy quaker and active abolitionist who spent much of his time enjoying lively correspondence with prominent literary social and political leaders of his day guerrier mother died when she was three years old leaving her father george guerrier grief stricken and chaffing under the disapproving eye of his wife family with few resources of his own guerrier father shuttled her from one relative to the next over the next ten years moving from the opulent parlors of her maternal grandfather mansion in new bedford and an aunt drawing rooms in the middle class south end of boston to the poor household of a minister uncle and his family guerrier came to feel uncomfortable in both spheres only when she settled briefly with her mother brother and sister walton and anna ricketson did she find a sense of peace security and belonging  the ricketson family had been intimate with the literary circle of concord massachusetts of the mid nineteenth century henry david thoreau ralph waldo emerson bronson alcott and other literary giants were close friends of guerrier maternal grandfather when daniel ricketson passed away his two surviving children walton and anna maintained many of those relationships anna closest friends were louisa may alcott and her sister anna alcott pratt when guerrier wrote her autobiography in her eighties she vividly remembered visiting the alcott home meeting the author of little women and being shown may room left a lifelong impression  p  these women opened up a world of possibilities to guerrier and offered her a model of womanhood that stretched beyond the domestic sphere to a world of independence literature and sisterhood guerrier attended the vermont methodist seminary and female  louisa may alcott wrote several poems dedicated to our anna in which she and her sister rejoiced in anna tireless kindness and thoughtfulness and friendship   anna pratt gave a pearl necklace to edith writing for my pearl was set on pleasing little edith 
the saturday evening girls  college in montpelier vermont where she enjoyed literature music art and sports and where she was introduced to the works of the latest social theorists includingjohn ruskin  p xxxi after graduating in  with honors  guerrier returned to massachusetts and enrolled at the museum school of boston museum of fine arts  but soon found her needs for money so urgent that she had to give up pursuit of full time artistic training and find paid work with a letter of introduction from william lloyd garrison ii a friend of her father she secured a position at shaw day nursery at nbsis in the north end she continued to take evening courses at the museum school and soon became close friends with a talented young artist named edith brown self conscious of her poverty guerrier felt intimidated by the more prosperous looking students longing for companionship she searched for someone of my own age who did not look prosperous  pp   during a perspective class at the museum school in  guerrier met brown they moved in together and started a lifelong personal and professional relationship that would span forty years of dedication to each other until brown death in  while working at the nursery at nbsis guerrier was approached by liliah pingree a close friend of pauline shaw and a director of shaw various neighborhood nurseries  pp   she asked guerrier to lead several girls clubs that were being organized in various settlement houses and to maintain the reading room at nbsis in many cities associations and clubs were formed for working class women and girls that focused on physical industrial mental and moral improvement  p  these clubs it was believed supplied a common ground of meeting for young women who have had the privileges of education money and leisure with those who have had the privileges of self denying hard working lives and the benefits are mutual  p  guerrier however lacked the privileges of money and leisure and thought herself fortunate to have had the real adventure of being ill clad ill fed ill sheltered i am grateful for this experience which makes it easier for me to get the point of view of the girl who is literally on her own  p  guerrier exemplified the growing population of well educated single women caught between their middleor upper class family identity and the economic realities of  edith had apparently been interested in becoming an artist since she was a child   pingree was also an early proponent and supporter of the kindergarten movement in boston a member of the boston school committee from  to  and manager of the north bennet street industrial school from  to   see also nbsis records
 the library quarterly needing to support themselves pingree however recognized guerrier untapped abilities and promoted her on the first leg of her journey in the emerging career of librarianship for women the reading rooms at nbsis had become so popular that guerrier gave up all of her other club duties to work exclusively in the north end in  with the official opening of a boston public library branch in the north end at nbsis daily deliveries of books were made to the industrial school which henceforth became known as station w  guerrier title was changed to custodian of the station w of the boston public library and she was given a salary of forty dollars a month initially however guerrier had been reluctant to choose library work as a life profession i did not wish to be responsible for giving to young people some of the trash i myself had obtained from public libraries this qualm had been silenced by logical reasoning i felt there was not as much trash in a public library as there was on a newsstand furthermore there was always the opportunity of quietly offering the best whether it was accepted or not again who was i to set myself up as an infallible judge of good or bad literature perhaps my tastes were not sufficiently catholic after all i had read much trash and forgotten it other young people would be pretty sure to do the same thing  p  as head librarian guerrier continued directing several clubs in the library and was eager to transform them into something whereby young women could find together the key to some secret garden in which we can profitably enjoy ourselves  p  burdened by the directive to draw these girls in from the perils of the street  p  guerrier sought to organize the clubs along the same lines as the more literary and educational clubs that already existed for boys these perils were a constant theme throughout the reform literature of the time period saloons dance halls and other cheap amusements were thought of as precursors to prostitution and the loss of morality while the threat of prostitution and entrapment in white slavery was real for some vulnerable single poor and immigrant women middle class observers uneasiness with the explicit or potential sexuality of these young women created a tension that manifested itself as an assumption that all poor immigrant women needed to be morally and physically protected in fact many young immigrant women were also concerned with projecting an image of middle class respectability and social purity the reality was that mostjewish and italian parents would not allow their daughters out of the house in the evening without a chaperon usually an older sibling preferably male or other relative  guerrier does not mention what type of literature she considered trash  for an expanded discussion of this point see  
the saturday evening girls  the reformers language was therefore typical of the time period and the low expectations of moral character in immigrants but did not reflect the reality of these young women lives the nbsis felt however that girls were sadly in need of every form of moral and mental enrichment and that strenuous effort was made to introduce them to the joys of reading  pp  o what the reformers at nbsis may have interpreted as resistance may have actually been an issue of opposition from parents who were fearful of education and americanization for their daughters the younger generation often learned english and accepted american lifestyles more readily than their parents many older immigrants viewed american culture as a threat to their own religious and cultural traditions this view was particularly true for daughters who were expected to remain under the control of their families until they married for some saturday evening girls attending meetings meant defying their parents according to one seg daughter some girls had to hide their books from their parents lest they be scolded and prevented from visiting the reading rooms at north bennet street  another seg wrote the tragic gap between the first and second generation is the high price of assimilation  p  despite nbsis staff s protestations that the difficulty of leading the girls to read as seriously and continuously as the boys is not altogether overcome  p  they ignored their own statistics in the boy reading rooms the average daily attendance from september  to april  was  and in the girl reading room it was   p  during the winter of  the reading rooms at the library were crowded to overflowing and there is usually a crowd of children at the door some of whom have to wait outside for an hour for a chance to come in and read quietly  pp   guerrier efforts to interest more girls in reading had the effect of increasing the average daily attendance to  for girls with a subsequent drop to sixty four for boys during the year and the staff noted there was a great need of a third reading room for the older girls  pp i interestingly by  however the boys library contained over one thousand volumes and the girls contained only six hundred  p   this is in direct contrast to many woman centered reform organizations that actually assumed that reading and library rooms for women and girls were not only essential but much in demand by them the women educational and industrial union in boston is a case in point  there are many sources that describe this situation see   and    under pressure from the trustees of nbsis helen storrow and the community the city of boston eventually purchased a building for the purpose of establishing a permanent branch library in the north end in

 the library quarterly a variety of urban issues including sanitation public health education and social services these clubs for girls and young women became an important part of the americanization process not only because of the programs that focused on civic and educational agendas but also because of their selfgoverning organizational structures inspired by guerrier a governing body of ten members was elected yearly by the oldest group the saturday evening girls a house committee was formed that met on a weekly basis to generate policies and rules concerning the running of the clubhouse and these were then voted on by the entire body of the clubhouse once a month  p  the girls and young women learned on a microlevel the concepts of a democratic government they found discipline and confidence in a system whereby they could create an organization with rules and laws and could resolve problems and reach decisions based on a vote of the majority by participating in the everyday running of the clubs the members learned valuable lessons on responsibility and the use of power this was particularly important for women and girls who lacked opportunities in the public sphere as well as the private sphere to govern their own lives it was as a result of her appointment to the library service that guerrier met helen osborne storrow storrow was intrigued by guerrier work with the girls clubs in the reading rooms at north bennet street when they met at the turn of the century storrow was still a young woman just emerging as an important philanthropic figure in the boston community they shared an understanding and appreciation for the disadvantages facing young women and girls for storrow this was the beginning of her own personal female dominion unfettered by other powerful feminists a place within which she could define and develop her own personal vision for independent womanhood  although storrow continued to improvise and establish new programs at north bennet street for both boys and girls her involvement with the saturday evening girls developed into a more personal and lifelong relationship storrow had joined the board of managers of north bennet street in  and was a member of the board of visitors of the boston public library a quaker storrow was the granddaughter of martha coffin wright and grandniece of lucretia coffin mott ardent abolitionists and suffragists who together with elizabeth cady stanton were among the small group that organized the first women rights convention in  in seneca falls new york storrow father was a successful manufacturer of farm equipment in auburn new york and her mother eliza wright osborne maintained her family heritage of strong commitment to social and political reform  eliza sister ellen wright

the saturday evening girls  rope for a much needed vacation  during a stay in the swiss alps the two women talked of ideas of starting an industry at which the young women in the library clubs could earn extra money on visiting a charming little pottery on the lake of thun they realized the possibilities of starting their own pottery  p  we spoke of making marmalade or fruitcake of hemming napkins and dishtowels and finally we spoke of pottery of the charming peasant ware of italy of holland of germany and now of switzerland since our club girls were almost all of peasant stock why not start an art pottery and produce american peasant ware  p  guerrier brown and storrow recognized that the need of these young women to contribute to family income conflicted with the pursuit of education beyond grammar school while reformers in boston and all over the country were providing educational vocational and americanization programs few were addressing the fact that many immigrant youths could not fully take advantage of these opportunities their financial contribution to the family far outweighed any hopes of higher education establishing a commercial industry to provide financial resources rather than just skills training was a step toward resolving that problem through guerrier help brown first started teaching at nbsis while still studying at the museum school during the late s brown was hired to teach drawing on a part time basis to various clubs and classes of boys and girls including guerrier saturday evening girls club her talent popularity with the students and interest in the modeling department eventually won her a full time position at the school  pp   brown was familiar with the making of pottery and the operation of a kiln and her artistic training and background obviously played a major role in the decision to start a pottery it was not until  however that official pottery classes as opposed to modeling were conducted at nbsis and like the clay wood and stone modeling classes these pottery classes were offered primarily for boys and young men  rarely particularly talented young women or girls were allowed admittance to the modeling and pottery classes in the many modeling classes conducted prior to  only three girls  guerrier association of peasant stock with peasant ware was typical of the time period many differentiated these late nineteenth and early twentieth century eastern european and southern italian immigrants as peasants in direct contrast to the earlier northern and western european and northern italian immigrants who were often better educated and more financially secure  the nbsis had installed a potter wheel in the modeling room in  and a kiln in  edith brown is first noted here as a teacher in modeling and she is last listed as a teacher in the report for the year ending august   which coincides with the establishment of the paul revere pottery see 
 the library quarterly are listed two of them albina mangini and cecilia leverone were enrolled in a class of twenty six boys the other rose dondero was the only girl in a class of thirty four boys  interestingly all three young women were saturday evening girls who went on to successful careers as decorators at the paul revere pottery in the summer of  with storrow approval and her donation of funds to purchase the equipment the two ediths started training in the specifics of pottery making they hired a local potter and found a pottery chemist from the old merrimac pottery of newburyport massachusetts who for a substantial consideration parted with some of his formulas which we found later on in a printed book of formulas in our own public library  p  with great trepidation and excitement they fired their first bright blue glazed tiles in the cellar of guerrier and brown chestnut hill home  p  by the summer of  several segs began to learn pottery making in chestnut hill there they began to sign their pottery seg for saturday evening girls along with their initials and the pottery works or bowl shop as it was first known was born that fall they moved the operations to west gloucester with a plan to establish the pottery near the new seg camp they quickly realized however that transportation was a prow lem not only for equipment clay and other raw materials but also in the logistics of living there throughout the winter which proved to be daunting  no records exist that show what role if any nbsis played in the establishment of the paul revere pottery in february  a special meeting of the board of managers of north bennet street school was called to hear an account of the work of the library department and miss guerrier proposition for a pottery and bowl shop at the camp in west gloucester  held at storrow beacon street home we can only speculate as to the discussion because the minutes of that meeting are no longer extant we do know that nbsis did not apparently consider this venture an opportunity the school ought to pursue or support interestingly nbsis annual reports offer little recognition to the saturday evening girls work with the paul revere pottery the annual report for  stated clearly that the school newly organized pottery classes which were specifically for boys had been maintained primarily for its recreational and cultural value its connection  in  helen storrow purchased an acre of land in west gloucester massachusetts where she built a cottage with fourteen bedrooms a living room and a kitchen for the club working girls for much needed summer vacations  p  seventy five years later gertrude friederman would remember that her two weeks at the seg camp were one of the great times of her life 
the saturday evening girls  with industry is quite incidental  p  by  nbsis claimed that others have followed their lead in making pottery the industrial school has again taken its place as a leader by showing others the possibilities in this field  p  in its enthusiasm to celebrate its own accomplishments and to promote its vision of industrial training nbsis neglected to recognize the accomplishments of the saturday evening girls as a library group the saturday evening girls activities had become an acceptable leisure activity as a commercial venture the segs and their pottery works no longer fit into nbsis vision for the industrial training for girls and young women it is likely that there existed some level of tension between the two for girls classes in modeling at nbsis remained elusive as late as  the school executive committee vetoed a proposal to open the modeling program to girls  the prevailing attitude regarding the most suitable vocational training for elementary school and older girls was that of two points of view    woman relation to self support and woman relation to the home  pp   during the winter of  the boston school committee authorized fifty thirteen year old girls from the upper grades of the hancock school to come to the nbsis for ten hours of industrial training every week the nbsis recognized the pressures of girls familial obligations and financial needs and resistance on the part of parents to the advantages of additional educational opportunities although typical of the language of the time period nbsis annual report for  stated that this experiment was founded on the premise that in the north end    with rare exceptions the girls leave school as early as the law permits whether they go at once into industrial or into home life the training in hand and machine sewing in domestic science and in textiles and design which we propose to give will make a much needed connection between the school course and the life that follows  p  by  however nbsis reported that the experiment was not successful the class on account of the age mental capacity and development of the girls and general attitude toward the work was not a very encouraging one  p  because of the girls lack of interest in this sort of industrial training it was naturally assumed that they were intellectually not capable of developing the basic skills necessary  the segs are mentioned again in the annual report for the school in  but there was no discussion of their commercial venture only their work with the library clubs  pp    by  however the school was also offering classes in modeling as well as printing drafting and telephone operating in addition to its regular domestic skills training

 the library quarterly process of accepting the more appealing alternative promoted by guerrier brown and storrow the segs became part of a modem movement toward greater options for women educationally politically and economically the segs were surrounded and perhaps even indoctrinated with modern liberal ideas while at the same time they faced strong ethnic and old world values and nineteenth century victorian ideals of women and their roles in the public and private spheres the segs demonstrated a determined resistance to the demands not only of industrialization but also of society limited expectations for them as working class women and as immigrants according to goldstein these girls were quite ordinary in their ordinariness they proved extraordinary  p  appendix table al percentage of seg graduates from the hancock grammar school         n  n  n  n  n  n  number              soum statistics documents of the school commeite of the ciy of boston boston municipal pfintng office  references  seg news cherry tree edition  boston public library north end branch boston  seg news   reunion edition  boston public library north end branch boston  seller maxine schwartz immigrant women philadelphia temple university press   weinberg sydney stahl the world of our mothers new york schoken   smith judith family connections albany ny suny press   ewen elizabeth immigrant women in the land of dollars new york monthly review   blair karen j the clubwoman as feminist true womanhood redefined   new york holmes  meier   murolo priscilla the common ground of womanhood class gender and working girl clubs   urbana university of illinois press   gere anne ruggles literacy and cultural work in us women clubs   urbana university of illinois press   peiss kathy cheap amusements working women and leisure in turn of the century new york philadelphia temple university press   united states bureau of the census thirteenth decenial census of the united states  reels   massachusetts suffolk county  solomon barbara miller in the company of educated women a history of women and higher education in amenca new haven conn yale university press   jacobsjerry a and greene margaret e race and ethnicity social class and school
