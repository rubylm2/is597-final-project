  the library quarterlyof the public sphere at the hands of the neoliberal economic philosophy for nearly the past  decades buschman   jaeger et al  a flurry of recent activity however has created additional concerns the republican study committee an influential source of policy ideas among conservatives is advocating the defunding and closure of multiple federal agencies that support libraries and archives including the institute for museum and library services the national endowment of the arts and the national endowment for the humanities emboldened by overwhelming conservative victories at the national and state levels many county and city officials are beginning to target the closure of public and school libraries as part of antitax platforms such challenges and the responses of our field are chronicled by the vital everylibrary organization the federal hiring freeze could significantly affect the library of congress the national archives and records administration the smithsonian institution and countless other federal libraries and archives the new secretary of education has no experience in public schools and during her confirmation hearings demonstrated a desire to shift funds to voucher programs the implementation of these new policies and initiatives will have shortand long term adverse impacts on public schools public libraries and other institutions that serve the public good another approach could be to focus on how broader policies will affect information institutions and information professionals the george w bush administration the most recent previous us presidential administration with a strong belief in neoliberal economics offloaded many government responsibilitiesespecially helping residents with online government forms and servicesonto the institutions of our field jaeger bertot and gorham  it also created many laws and policiesmost notably the usa patriot act and the homeland security actthat directly shaped the operations of the institutions of our field we stood up to many intrusions into the privacy and freedom of expression of patrons and worked to educate the public about these intrusions it seems likely that the very conservative and activist new administration will produce similarly lively policy impacts the new administrations relentless criticism of any media organization that disagrees with the president demonstrates a lack of respect toward such values as freedom of expression that are central to the information professions turmoil in the political arena also creates issues related to the services provided by information institutions particularly to those most in need as the social safety net erodes in various ways more people will need our institutions we lived through this experience less than a decade ago at the height of the great recession usage of our institutions spiked as more people had greater needs for internet education and access and for materials they could no longer afford to purchase jaeger gorham sarin and bertot  jaeger et al  unfortunately the budgets and infrastructure of many institutions have yet to recover from the large usage increases during the great recession furthermore the voices of the populations who most rely on our institutions because they are those being othered and dehumanized by the new
from the editors  administration will not likely carry much weight in political discussions about the importance and contributions of our institutions the unfortunate reality is that all of these perspectives are intertwined financial support may well plummet political headwinds will likely accelerate to hurricane strength and many of the key populations we serve seem likely to face increasing discrimination and isolation but we will still be there to serve our communities we must endure we must persist the inescapable question is how to survive and adapt without losing the utterly unique nature of our profession our institutions and our contributions to our communities and society as a whole this issue of library quarterly and the next issue are twinned special issues titled aftermath libraries democracy and the  presidential election featuring essays by a variety of scholars educators and advocates who we believe will make valuable contributions to the ongoing discussions about the meaning of the  presidential election to our profession and our institutions across these two issues you will find many insights perspectives and suggestions as to what our profession and our institutions can and should do next the two issues in this issue we present eight articles that touch on many of the themes and topics related to the role of libraries and other information institutions in society that lq often addresses equitable access to information information literacy and diversity and inclusion these articles taken together paint a vivid picture of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead of us the issue opens with two articles that clearly articulate why ongoing discussions about fake news are of such importance to our profession at this moment in time alternatives to apathy and indifference civic education in public libraries by jenny s bossaller and posttruth truthiness and alternative facts information behavior and critical information consumption for a new age by nicole a cooke these ongoing discussions at their core are about information literacy and we are pleased to present a range of articles that highlight the intersection of information literacy and  race teaching to dismantle white supremacy in archives by michelle caswell and remotivating the black vote the effect of low quality information on black voters in the  presidential election and how librarians can intervene by andrew p jackson sekou molefi baako denyvetta davis and jason kelly alston  ethnicity information sources of latin american immigrants in the rural midwest in the trump era by denice adkins heather moulaison sandy and jorge derpic and  class from the one mule tenant farmer to the hillbilly highway how librarians can support the white working class by kathleen de la pena mccook these articles offer some insight into how libraries and archives can serve their communities during these uncertain times but many questions remain about what libraries can and should do now and so this issue closes with two articles that reflect on the core values of librarianship that serve to reinforce why it is so importantnow more than everthat we remain committed to these values opposing

from the editors  or the good by political leaders over the coming years this will be an important lesson to keep in mind sharp as a whip tough as an ox we have faced many economic and political challenges over the past  centuries and found ways not only to survive but to expand our contributions based on this unique ability we have previously argued that our field is one of foxes based on the classic metaphor of the hedgehog and the fox see jaeger et al  in the seventh century bce greek poet archilochus wrote the fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing foxes pursue many ends often unrelated and even contradictory and hedgehogs relate everything to a single central vision berlin   in the natural world foxesamazingly adaptable in habit diet and living quartershave flourished in both urban and rural environments whereas the population of hedgehogs who keep to established behaviors is declining quickly our field could not be more foxlike metaphorically speaking foxes are intellectual gathersadapting to changes taking many approaches to a problem seeing many possible outcomes dealing well with uncertainty and complexity practicing self reflection and examining problems in a multidisciplinary manner our field perpetually changes and innovates to meet community needs as they arise continually redefining what we do for our patrons our institutions collect a wide assortment of multidisciplinary information sources and materials to meet a broad range of information needs repeatedly taking stands in support of freedom of expression and freedom of access to diverse perspectives and opinions based on a track record of overcoming challenges and finding new ways to succeed in our mission the fox will survive whatever is next in politics and economics but the people who rely on our institutionsmany of whom are targets of the current political discoursewill need the services and support of our field more than ever we may not be able to turn the entire world around in the next few years but we will be able to help many individuals and many communitiesand maybe even help shape the public discourse about these challenges the articles in this issue and the next of library quarterly will hopefully be of great service as we work to meet the many urgencies of now faced by our patrons our communities and our field references berlin isaiah  the hedgehog and the fox an essay on tolstoy view of history new york simon  schuster berman sanford  on my mindlibraries class and the poor peoples policy american libraries    bertot john c and paul t jaeger  the ada and inclusion in libraries libraries have been and continue to be champions for access american libraries october  httpamericanlibrariesmagazine orgblogsthe scoopada inclusion in libraries
