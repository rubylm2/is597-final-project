implications for the storage and retrieval of knowledge c d gull evolution of communication w ith this paper the conference turns from considerations of the input phase of our communication effort and introduces a new aspect of our topic that of taking ideas out in new forms before we do so it is entirely appropriate that we consider again what a remarkable achievement the book is and what a remarkable part it has played in the process of distinguishing man from animals we need look back only thirty thousand years or so to see man as one of the many classes of animals struggling for existence in a natural environment in contrast to our highly artificial one even then man at least in our opinion today stood as the most successful of all the animals although some animals were more ferocious and efficient in capturing food others were better engineered and armored for life in the wilderness and many possessed keener sight hearing and sense of smell man stood upright on two legs thus freeing his other two feet to use as hands he looked forward with binocular and hence stereoscopic vision to communicate with his fellows he spoke words or language instead of uttering guttural grunts or barks or squeals he used fire to warm himself and to cook his food he developed crude weapons to overcome his deficiencies as a hunting animal his brain was the largest and most complex in the world and it gave him his greatest measure of superiority over the animals then we assume as now the brain contained about ten billion or ten thousand million cells each cell connected directly or indirectly to every other with small electrical impulses flowing through the connecting nerve fibers at between fifty and two hundred miles per hour this brain serves as the center of an extremely complex communication system which has uncounted millions of cells on the surface of the body to receive stimuli more cells in the nerves to carry impulses to the brain and then more cells to carry impulses to muscles and glands to make them perform this system is in continuous operation receiving stimuli sending out impulses receiving new stimuli in a manner called feedback in electronics all to control the body within very close tolerances as an organism slowly burning its latest meal psychologists and psychiatrists believe that an individual every experience is stored in his brain and can be recalled under proper stimulus the brain then afforded primitive man an extraordinary means of storing information and of recalling experience in addition the brain could utilize the information it retained to lead to learning and even to original thought and it continued to function and to add to its store of experience and learning as long as the individual lived we know how keenly we feel the loss of an older man an expert in today i b v bowden ed faster than thought a symposium on digital computing machines london pitman publishing corp  
 the library quarterly terms in full possession of his faculties how much more serious must have been the death of an elder or chieftain to a small band of men in primitive times his communication was limited to primitive speech to the immediate moment and to other men within hearing of his voice his experiences and learning had to be passed from generation to generation as memorized accounts which today we call stories and legends in a sense every man and woman had to attempt to receive store and pass on to sons or daughters the accumulated history of mankind some idea of the magnitude of the task may be gained if we think of the members of this conference as the only survivors of a world wide catastrophe waking up in a wilderness a favorable wilderness abounding in wildlife vegetation and mineral resources together we know enough to reconstitute much of current technology but i doubt whether we could accomplish it in our lifetimes how then would we record what we know so that our descendants could build on our experience the sheer volume of man accomplishments makes it clear that unaided memory speech and action are insufficient to recapitulate and transmit from one generation to the next our constantly cumulating store of information primitive man may not have recognized as clearly as we do the need for storing information outside the brain but over the centuries he began to do what he could with materials at hand iperhaps after piling up sticks and stones in attempts at numeration it may have dawned on someone that it was possible to make a mark on some physical object which could be kept for a period of years and which would serve to stimulate an association of ideas in the brains of later generations thus recalling the experience of earlier ones anthropology and history show us that indeed man came to this realization for we have cave paintings primitive sculpture pictographic and hieroglyphic forms of writing and within very recent times the development of that remarkable creation the alphabet and the later creation of the number system in the beginning the substances on which these marks could be placed were not satisfactory naturally smooth spaces in protected areas are relatively few as attested by the few cave paintings which have survived to this day the walls of the egyptian tombs have suffered the ravages of pilfering and of time and tombs were not public places where the population of an area could go for education some other medium for storing these marks was necessary the clay tablets of the assyrians had certain virtues for this purpose it was relatively easy to make marks in wet clay with pointed objects and then by firing the clay into tablets to assure the preservation of these marks but clay tablets are unhandy for the storage of information and they are very poor for transporting information from one place to another the wax tablet was an improvement in this respect but its durability was not great animal skins made into various kinds of parchment and vellum provided another medium but they have a tendency to deteriorate and only unusual circumstances have permitted the preservation of the few ancient examples which remain as we know the egyptians discovered that the stalks of the papyrus plant could be pounded flat and laid alternatively at right angles and pressed into a relatively acceptable writing surface when these stalks were laid in long strips they made a surface that could be rolled up consequently the scroll became one of the
storage and retrieval of knowledge  earliest forms on which man attempted to store information now the scroll is a very unhandy form for this purpose as we know from searching for a specific bit of information on such modern scrolls as sound recording tape a microfilm or motion picture rolls consequently one of the greatest technical advances in storing information came when the sections of a scroll were cut apart and bound on one edge to form what we now call the book perhaps this advance came from tying sheets of parchment together or from tying the edges of accordion folded papyrus scrolls at any rate the advantages of such a change in format are clear a solid object is easier to hold a book can readily be opened to that place in the text which carries the information we want and we are not faced with the necessity of carefully rolling up one end while unrolling the other lest the whole thing close up in our faces moving ahead we can see that man did very well in these twenty eight thousand years with the materials available to him by some two thousand years ago he had by his own effort learned how to speak he had produced the equivalent of speech in the alphabet and numbers and he had learned how to write them down so that generation after generation could use the information he had developed from the materials readily at hand a very convenient storage device in the book the fact that very little change occurred for hundreds of years after these accomplishments attests to his success there was not much of a problem with the organization of recorded information when it was all set down by hand most individuals owned so few books that they were thoroughly familiar with their entire contents only in one or two places in the world were there enough books to create a problem of arrangement it was only when the printing press was invented enabling man to duplicate his records in great quantity that he had to face the problem of organizing the information which he had been diligently collecting for centuries the widespread publication made possible by the printing press so accelerated the growth and recording of knowledge that the sheer bulk of our recorded information is today a cause of serious concern many fear that if the record becomes so unwieldy that it is not possible to locate what is needed when it is needed the future progress of mankind might be seriously hampered it is interesting to note that man attempts at improving his communications have been tending toward a more and more accurate reproduction of the living moment as a single person sees it and hears it and feels it emotionally visual action sound and feeling are present in the theater in musical performances in teaching in motion pictures and in television telegraphy has changed from the dot and dash sounds of the early receiver to the visual action record of the teletypewriter telephony and radio remain sound and feeling without visual action but radio has grown into television by adding visual action the black and white spectrum is being abandoned for the color spectrum in both movies and television color sound movies and television represent our highest achievement n communication techniques today but most of the deliberate rehearsed employment of communication methods are based on a script or book from which text and directions are obtained by the performers thus the book remains central to all these efforts as far as we know the stimuli from the five senses reach the brain with equal speed but sight and hearing are used to acquire information almost to the exclu
 the library quarterly sion of touch smell and taste when we consider that touch smell and taste depend on immediate and convenient contact with the stimulus while sight operates from light waves and hearing from sound waves whose sources may be far or near it is clear why sight and hearing are so important in acquiring and transmitting information only the blind who read braille or other raised writing make conscious use of the sense of touch to acquire information and they are quite well aware how slowly they acquire information by touch in comparison to the sighted reader and the listener who uses the talking book service our senses being what they are i think we may safely predict that future developments in the storage and retrieval of information will depend upon what we can do technologically with sight and hearing action and speech transient impulses and permanent records there are certain physical physiological and social limits to what man can do in the technology of communication for example nothing can be communicated faster than the speed of light or electromagnetic radiation  miles per second our eyes receive as visible light only a fraction of the spectrum from red with a wave length of  millimicrons to violet with one of  millimicrons because our nerves and brain cannot transmit and interpret the impulses fast enough to permit us to see receive most of the events which occur in this spectrum sixteen pictures flashed on a screen in a second give the illusion of moving pictures as for sound a man with sharp hearing can receive roughly only from  to  cycles per second of the waves encompassed in the sonic spectrum in air which has a range of zero to   cycles per second in spite of the limitation of the eye and ear there are some  discriminable colors and another  discriminable tones which we can receive and which make up the colorful and noisy world we know doubtless it is well that we cannot tune in on more of the light and sonic spectra than we do ultrasonic vibrations for example may distress or injure the human body but the wide discrepancy between what is scientifically possible to transmit and the physiological limits on man ability to receive it has an effect on our efforts to mechanize electrify and electronize the storage and retrieval of information the invention of printing from movable type and the powering of presses with steam and electricity have blanketed the civilized world with the book newspaper magazine pamphlet and broadside for all practical purposes mass production assures that every human being can be supplied with the printed word and in a  per cent flexibly intercommunicating world population every person would be able to transmit and receive communications with every other person in the world as yet however the saturation point of the human race for printed material is unguessed and far from achievement mass coverage with the spoken word is almost a  per cent possibility today in the united states where  per cent of the dwelling units and  per cent of the automobiles are equipped with radio but such communication travels in one direction only xvhile  per cent of our population could conceivably lift a telephone receiver simultaneously to reply to a question on the radio only a fraction of this number could reply at one time over fifty million telephones to any one central point for tabulating answers the magnitude of the reply problem is seen in the slowness with which national elec

storage and retrieval of knowledge  while this device is some sixty times faster than key punching or typewriting it is useful only for material already down in black and white on the page the original placement of new material on the page still requires the depression of a key for each character a device is needed which will transfer speech to impulses which the computer can handle and we are far from such a device today more serious i think than the technological problems of storage input and output for which the techniques undoubtedly can be improved to a certain extent in the next few years is the code or language which is needed for the machines a child picks up words meaning language long before we try to teach him letters spelling and grammar numbers and mathematics machines on the other hand approach from units and try to simulate understanding the turing machine which appears to be the foundation for a universal computer can be thought of as a mechanical calculator which literally works with pencil and paper it writes its numbers in the simplest possible form as a string of units thus requiring thirty five of them for the number  with a table of logical control of only a few thousand entries it seems able to perform essentially all the problem solving tasks that a man can although at a distressingly slow pace one reason for the slowness is that information content per stroke is at a minimum in the binary scale  can be expressed as  and this is more economical of strokes than the units of turing machine here we have introduced speed as well as increased economy of notation for the binary scale fits the onoff characteristics of an electron tube and such a tube can easily be switched on and off a million times a second but it still requires three times as many characters as do decimal numnbers and the alphabetic scale goes even farther beyond most of the computer technology of our day while letters and words can be coded as binary and decimal numbers visual meaning disappears for the human user when they are so coded when spoken too these numbers do not mean what the spoken words mean yet man nervous system and brain whose cells cannot be used more than one hundred times a second can view  letters and numbers a minute sort them into words understand their meaning and relationship and finally store the impressions for future use as john g kemeny points out the fact is that machines have rnot yet imitated the human brain method of storing and recovering information for instance it we tried to increase maniac memory by any considerable amount we would soon find it almost impossible to extract information we would have to use a complex system of coding to enable the machine to hunt up a given item of information and this coding would load down the memory further and make the logical control more complex only when we acquire a better understanding of the brain amazing ability to call forth information will we be able to give a machine anything more than a limited memory in other words the difference between a computer memory and the brain is more than a matter of mere complexity we may well wonder whether imitation of the brain is not a great deal more difficult to achieve than a completely original technological solution of the problem of information control application of communication theory to research libraries harold fleisher has outlined in the preceding paper the mathematical theory of communication developed by claude e shannon of the bell telephone  john g kemeny man viewed as a machine scientific american cxcii april

storage and retrieval of knowledge  or more brains are involved in the transmission of a message in figure  while generally the brain of a single person is both the information source and the destination in the use of a library fig  whereas a communication circuit should carry the message through to the destination without alteration the library user poses a question or idea at the information source but seeks an answer at the destination the message therefore undergoes a complete transformation in its passage through a library or information service in this passage the association of ideas must be as perfect as possible whereas in simple communication the faithful reproduction of the message at its destination is all that is required the library user who makes his own search unaided by his fellowman does not use the transmitter of figure  although he carries a verbalization of his question or idea in his mind and attempts to match this verbalization to the collection and bibliographic aids which he consults as he reads his way to the answer he seeks his eyes serve as the receiver and his brain as the destination most users are unaware of the semantic and engineering noise which must be overcome in making such basic type of search and the difficulties can be neglected here for a moment most searches are more complicated than the single operation represented by the diagram they even appear to be iterative in character the moment our user asks a librarian for aid face to face he uses his voice as a transmitter sound waves as the message path or circuit the librarian ear as receiver and the librarian brain as the destination the librarian then performs a search for the user and having found an answer speaks to the user thus employing the basic diagram to complete the circuit from user through collection to user again or a ba if the user telephones his question and the librarian replies by phone the iteration is more complex the pattern now becomes a aba a instead of a ba questions which reach state department librarians from overseas create a very complex communication pattern for example a police chief in an indian city asks for a list of books and articles on modern criminology when in due course he receives a reply from washington his request has gone through the following steps  police chief speaks to foreign service officer   a  foreign service officer dictates cable a  cable is transmitted to state department library in washington a  librarianusesstatedepartmentlibrary b  librarian phones fbi library for aid  a  fbi library is searched b  librarian at fbi phones answer to librarian at state department a  state department librarian dictates answer a  cable is transmitted to foreign service officer in india a  foreign service officer phones answer to police chief with copy of cable following by mail a or the foreign service officer may ask the united states information library to check the list against its collections and report how many items it can supply thus adding to the chain of a and b although we have seen how many a and b may be involved in an information search we have not considered the capabilities and difficulties of b which correspond to the transmitter receiver and engineering and semantic noise of figure  writing and speech are the traditional inputs for figure  corresponding to the transmitter inputs in figure  as technology develops we shall see increasing
