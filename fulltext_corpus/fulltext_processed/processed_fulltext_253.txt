war measures past and future dan lacy i earlier papers have demonstrated the singular sensitivity of the research library to its social environment every significant change in the patterns of human thought and action is recorded not only in the books that are added to its collections but in the demands made upon its services and in the social responsibilities assumed for it by its directors it is therefore not surprising that war that most imperative of all social experiences should have deeply marked all research libraries in this century of war ii upon at least one research library of this country even the now remote wars of the nineteenth century had a distinct and often dramatic effect one of history quirks in the war of  saw collections of the library of congress reduced to ashes in the burning of the capitol a fortunate catastrophe by which jefferson library was enabled to serve as a remarkably improved phoenix of the national literary hopes the dramatic events of  both in mexico and in europe led the joint committee on the library to authorize the librarian to purchase all the constitutions and laws of mexico and also to subscribe for a newspaper published in vera cruz and for one published in the city of mexico and to order him to purchase immediately all works of any reputation touching the modern history existing conditions and prospects of hungary and germany in the civil war we see the staff depleted by the almost continuous and be it admitted fortunate absence of the librarian in his capacity as a military surgeon with the union army we see the act of the joint committee in directing the librarian to expend the hardly staggering sum of up to  in the procurement of pamphlets relating to the war and the statute of  appropriating  for the purchase of european journals of the war period and we see the remarkable series of laws enacted in the dosing months of the war and the immediate postwar period which by establishing the regular receipt of material through copyright deposit and both official and unofficial international exchanges laid the basis for the present character of the library a consequence of the spanish war was an awareness of enlarged american responsibilities expressed within the library of congress by librarian young emphasis on latin america in his acquisitions program and by an intensive preoccupation with the new american possessions in the work of the division of bibliography in these events in the history of one library we see foreshadowed most of the varied forms of impact which the wars of  minutes of the joint committee on the library august   quoted in william dawson johnston history of the library of congress vol i   washington government printing office  p   ibid citing minutes of the joint committee on the library february   bid 
war measures past and future  the twentieth century were to have upon american research libranres we see the threat to the physical existence of their holdings the awareness of the necessity of adding to the collections material needed in discharging war enlarged national responsibilities the draining away of staff to war service the role of libraries in preserving the documentation of the war period the recognition that out of war come broader horizons of national experience which require enlarged concepts of the collections and services of research libraries and the burgeoning of libraries in the general accelerations of national growth but it is not until world wars i and ii and our measures against a third that we see these patterns elaborated under the impact of total war upon a fully developed libraxy system iii libraries of all kinds in the united states saw as their principal responsibility in world war i the provision of iibrary service to men in uniform and they united in a truly remarkable effort to that end the american library association established a war service under the leadership of herbert putnam with headquarters in the library of congress this service raised and expended more than  in setting up libraries with over  books for the use of some  men as an entirely voluntary operation this was surely one of the greatest achievements of american librarianship uniting the efforts of librarians from the greatest research institutions as well as the smallest public libraries but it was a personal effort on the part of the librarians themselves having little permanent effect upon the collections or services of research libraries there was also among librarians a clear recognition of the function of their institutions as centers of information they sought to serve the many users who turned to the library for technical books and journals to aid them in preparing for wartime jobs they had or hoped to get or in converting their businesses to wartime purposes even more emphasis was laid on the library as a center of information about the war itself and the issues involved and special efforts were made to build up the collections to this end as allied sympathies grew more intense this information service of libraries became increasingly a matter of presenting allied points of view a result in part of the scarcity of popular works in english sympathetic to the central powers and of the skill of british propaganda services after american entry into the war libraries enthusiastically joined in the task of the patriotic indoctrination of their users and accumulated material with that purpose in view but the informational services were not all at the popular level e e richardson librarian of princeton university in his presidential address before the american library institute in  pointed out reference and bibliographical aid to research as the principal war responsibility of libraries of learning richardson and other librarians saw these research needs as lying in the fields of science and technology particularly chemistry and there was for the brief period of the war a quick intensification of tech theodore wesley koch books in the war the romance of library war seriice boston houghton mifflin co  gives the fullest account of this enterprise  an interesting summary is given in ralph t esterquest war attitudes and activities of american libraries   wilson library bulletin xv april   
 the library quarterly nical research that must have laid extraordinary demands upon certain segments of the collections of a few libraries but even in world war i it was beginning to appear that perhaps the most valuable wartime function of research libraries was as a source of information about other countries and the american library institute undertook as its major wartime project the preparation of a union list of foreign newspapers the library of congress and the new york public library engaged in the intensive preparation of bibliographies on war subjects largely for the national board on historical service and the institute sponsored a union list of war literature for the same purposes libraries also felt a keen sense of the historic significance of the war years and of the importance of their contemporary documentation they were regularly admonished in their professional literature to gather up and preserve the ephemera of the war and librarians were prominent in the state and community war history committees that were created over most of the country their enthusiastic if unwisely directed efforts led to the collection of ill digested masses of personalia rosters clippings posters photographs and other war records which generally lay unorganized and forgotten a few years after the war quite different was the effort of a few major institutions to build up really comprehensive research collections documenting the war in its global character the library of congress was enabled to create perhaps the largest of these but the new york public library and the libraries of harvard and yale universities were close behind histories and personal accounts official documents propaganda leaflets and posters diaries and letters and newspaper files and clippings composed the core of these collections they were very strong for the united states and reasonably so for the major allies and for germany but they were likely to be weak for russia and nonexistent for the minor central powers of far greater interest however than these collections gathered into existing institutions was the creation of a new institution the hoover library as it came to be called of war peace and revolution the establishment and growth of this remarkable library are well known and have been ably recounted by nathan van patten and philip maclean what is of interest to us is the clear recognition from the beginning that the events the library sought to document were of no mere historical concern but were part of a new and dynamic social continuum which american scholars must master and that they could not be adequately understood solely through conventional library materials conventionally acquired the intensive effort through special agents themselves often leaders in the events of the period to accumulate every form of evidence that would contribute to the understanding of the vast and slowly emerging character of a new and unfamiliar world was a development of major importance in american librarianship not only in the development of war collections but in their normal acquisitions libraries were hindered by wartime impediments to the flow of books exchanges with german institutions and purchases from german dealers were disrupted and shipments even from the alsamerican library institute papers and proceedings  chicago   nathan van patten herbert hoover and his library relations library journal liv    philip t maclean hoover institute and library library quarterly xix

 the library quarterly val the responsibilities deriving from the war were denied in action and in thought the conviction arose sustained by the special pleading of a group of historians that the united states had been duped into participation a cynical moral neutralism came to characterize american attitudes toward the war and the extraordinarily fine war record of american librarians became to some of their successors a matter of reproach and embarrassment surely this act of rejection of a whole area of national expenrence is one of the most remarkable manifestations of its sort in history and one hardly to be comprehended in other than psychiatric terms like such acts of suppression in individuals it required the reorganization and distortion of concepts in many related areas of experience with the consequence that america came to world war ii unprepared in terms of its scholarly and intellectual organization to deal with many of the realities it must confront v these realities were very different from those of  and the measures taken by libraries to confront them though falling into the earlier general patterns assumed a materially different character in the first place the organization of the war effort was far more systematic and professional a result of the earlier and more nearly total mobilization and the greater experience of the federal establishment in administering operations of enormous magnitude the volunteer drives that so commanded the enthusiasm of librarians in world war i were now likely to be handled by government agencies library service to the armed forces for example in consequence of the earlier work of the amencan library association was now a regular service of the government and no longer demanded the volunteer effort of the library profession somewhat similarly libraries especially public libraries served very efficiently as centers of information just as they had done in the earlier war but their effort could now be fitted into a rather well organized plan developed by the office of education the office of war information and the office of civilian defense again the documentation of the war period the object of spontaneous enthusiasms in world war i was organized within the federal govemment on a systematic and highly professional basis by the committee on records of war administration within the executive office of the president careful planning by the social science research council and the committee on conservation of cultural resources encouraged libraries historical societies and similar agencies to collect and administer the documentation of the war period as emphases within their regular programs of activity with the consequence that the subsequently orphaned collections of world war i were generally avoided in the second place the degree of mobilization effected was much higher and in consequence the normal patterns of operation of libraries were disturbed more radically and for a longer period of time staff turnover was much greater shortages in equipment and supplies bedeviled all librarians and college and university libraries were subjected to sudden vicissitudes as normal enrolment fell off as training programs of the arned services might be housed on their campuses and as wartime research projects made unfamiliar demands on their collections many institutions dependent on

war measures past and future  were so much greater than in   that the international book trade was almost completely destroyed until the american entry into the war many american libraries working through a joint committee on importations which was particularly effective in dealing with british censorship managed to obtain reasonably good coverage of european and japanese journals but after pearl harbor imports of books for american libraries generally were for practical purposes confined to those from the british commonwealth and the western hemisphere the principal libraries and research and intelligence units of the federal government created an interdepartmental committee to arrange the procurement and assignment of foreign publications by the use of microfilm and of a number of circuitous channels this committee and its constituent agencies were able to maintain a restricted flow of materials to meet the most essential needs of the government barriers to procurement could be overcome in any general sense however only as hostilities were concluded in particular areas the library of congress sent a representative to portugal and spain in april  and was able to arrange to have him follow close behind the troops in north africa and italy and later in france this arrangement however satisfactory for the library of congress as a federal agency did not meet the needs of nongovernmental libraries but it was obvious that those needs could be met only through some extension of federal action in consequence by agreement with the state and war departments on the one hand and with american libraries primarily as represented by the association of research libraries on the other the library of congress undertook in  to act as a procurement agency in europe for all interested american libraries and the state and war departments pledged their full co operation the size of the library of congress mission was materially increased specialists were engaged in many fields and the library advanced funds for multiple purchases all told over two million pieces were acquired by the mission through purchase through the transfer to the mission by the army of confiscated propaganda and collections of military and nazi organizations and through the transfer of materials seized by the office of censorship through the operation of a scheme of priorities carefully worked out by a committee under the chairmanship of robert b downs over two thirds of this material passed into the collections of one hundred and thirty co operating libraries at a final net average cost to them including the cost of the purchased material of  cents a volume this co operative acquisition project was one of the most successful of the wartime undertakings of american libraries one special enterprise of the project is worth note the negotiation with russian occupying authorities of arrangements for the release of nearly  worth of books principally serials held in leipzig for american institutions by german publishers and dealers this remarkable accomplishment together with the general work of the project made the world war ii period one of the strongest rather than one of the weakest periods in the holdings of american research libraries the procurement problem in japan was even more difficult but it was simpler in that fewer libraries were involved  the best general account is robert b downs wartime co operative acquisitions library quarterly xix   
 the library quarterly immediately following the war the library of congress had arranged for the ultimate transfer to its custody of the holdings of the washington documents center an enormous collection of japanese documents administered by the oss in behalf of the government agencies concerned the occupying forces had japanese co operation in making this collection as fully representative as possible of japanese work in all fields of scholarship though the library of congress undertook to make this collection useful for american libraries generally its enormous size over three hundred thousand pieces and the inadequate size of the staff that handles japanese materials have limited what the library can do more than thirty thousand duplicates have however been distributed to other libraries and as rapidly as the collection can be processed it is being made available for loan and photoduplication following the war the library of congress sent the acting head of its japanese section to japan to investigate the possibility of exchanges and other channels of procurement for american libraries generally this mission was helpful in restoring the acquisition of japanese books to more normal patterns the destruction of library holdings abroad that had so troubled american librarians in   now presented a far graver problem as the development of air power extended by thousands of miles the destructive range of battle and made difficult the distinction between proper and improper military objectives this concern was heightened by the adoption of looting as an organized practice of german leaders the first hope was for filming priceless materials in europe whose texts might otherwise be lost to civilization a conference on microcopying materials for research in foreign depositories was convened in june  by the american council of learned societies and the library of congress and it resolved on a swift and ambitious program with generous support from the rockefeller foundation operations were begun in england in  and were carried forward energetically throughout the war under the direction of the american council of learned societies and with full british co operation though events had moved too rapidly to permit filming on the continent the total result was impressive meanwhile librarians had participated actively in the work of the american commission for the protection and salvage of artistic and historic monuments in war areas through that commission they had aided in the preparation of lists of notable european libraries to be given immunity in american bombing in the designation of monuments and fine arts officers with american troops and in planning for the extraordinarily effective program carried out by the american army in the protection and restitution of library materials in occupied areas during the course of the war the lincoln cathedral copy of the magna carta and some three thousand of the most precious books among the holdings of the national library at peiping found protection in the united states and the latter were microfilmed as an additional measure of safety in anticipation of the need for restor the best description of the project though written in its early stages is d h daugherty current microcopying program in england journal of documentary reproduction iv     report of the american commission for the protection and salvage of artistic and historic monuments in war areas washington government printing office

 the library quarterly but the collapse of this order of society which might have been seen as impending in  was very nearly complete in  there were many reasons for this the two world wars and in particular the destructive campaigns of the second had gravely damaged the physical capacity to produce and had disrupted if not destroyed the sense of common purpose that had cemented this order of society but there were other and more fundamental causes the very success of the old order in providing for the first time in human history reasonable comfort and security for a considerable portion of mankind made intolerable its failure to do so for the remainder just as its economic success became a cause of failure the liberal just and humane ethos that developed within the dominant centers of this society was turned inward to become an instrument of successful attack on its moral values at once sustaining rebellion and secession among the subordinated dasses and peoples and palsying the will of the controlling groups the disintegration of this pattern of world organization is marked in the political sphere by the liquidation of the western empires the weakening of european and american political influence in the middle east and asia and the disappearance of the old concert of powers internally it has been marked by the acute civil disorder in the arab and asian worlds that has accompanied the withdrawal of western control and by the acute domestic tensions within most western states the same process in the economic field is witnessed by the decline in the production of raw materials in the previously subordinated areas as western technical direction is put aside and by the disruption of familiar patterns of trade as those areas endeavor to assert their economic independence concomitantly there is a marked disturbance of economic patterns within the individual metropolitan powers the current chaos in iran is a characteristic manifestation of both the political and the economic aspects of the process of disintegration we thus confront in our time in a grander dimension than history has heretofore provided one of the classic and tragic situations of the human race the enfeeblement of the organizing principle that has informed a comprehensive and stable order of society such situations in the past history of the race have introduced extended periods of disorganization approaching anarchy from which in time some novel organizing principle has emerged but anarchy has become an intolerable state under the relatively benign order of the past two centuries the population of the earth has multiplied so rapidly and distributed itself so asymmetrically that to stay alive it must produce and transport food and other goods in a volume possible only to a complex and highly differentiated economy operating under stable conditions if order and stability cannot be achieved within a framework of voluntary collaboration it is quite certain that they will be imposed by force within a totalitarian framnework society will in desperation turn to whatever organizing principle has the vigor to preserve it such an alternative organizing principle emerged from the chaos in which gernany and russia were left at the close of the last war has followed close upon the heels of chaos in asia and presses against the ineffectually functioning order of continental europe this totalitarian organizing principle substitutes imposed conformity for voluntary
war measures past and future  co operation rejects the humane individualism of the old order at its best enforces its will with terror and violence and expunges any notion of objective truth disinterested inquiry or free learning it is not i think an exaggeration to say that humanlkind now confronts the gravest question in its recorded history will the collapse of the western order continue to its end to be followed by a totalitarian order ruling with faceless brutality over the sleet gray centuries ahead or will the remaining healthy centers of the western order successfully reassert the moral economic and physical vigor of freedom as the organizing principle of a human society in which all men can voluntarily participate this question will not soon be answered for a very long time probably at least for the rest of all our lives it seems to me quite certain that we shall live in a time of troubles in which the margin between war and peace will remain indistinct or meaningless when we speak of the future measures of libraries in war therefore we necessarily mean the measures they address to this fundamental struggle of our century and i think the needed measures at least in their larger forms can be seen with some clarity it is obvious that the western world must rapidly increase its military strength to a point at which it can protect itself and maintain as much control as possible over the situation while a genuinely voluntary world order is developing it is obvious that it must increase it industrial production to a point that will sustain this military strength and at the same time enable it to include all its participants in the benefits of that production it is obvious that it must extend its technology to those impoverished areas of the world hitherto excluded from sharing its fruits it is obvious that it must be quit of the insularity that has hampered its effective dealing with and prevented its sympathetic understanding of slavic asian and african peoples and finally it is obvious that these responsibilities rest primarily upon the united states as the strongest and least harmed of the centers of western society vii but what do these responsibilities mean in concrete terms of library operations it seems to me that the measures they require can be summed up under six headings  recpgnizing the uncertainty and the probable disorder ahead we need to take long range measures for the more effective protection of our essential resources we think first of our holdings of rare books and manuscripts certainly their preservation is one of our first responsibilities and should be taken into account in our microfilming programs in the design of our future buildings and in those detailed plans for evacuation which every prudent librarian in a major city must hereafter hold in readiness but perhaps of even greater importance is the protection of the capacity of our national library system taken as a whole to render essential research services our basic holdings in slavic and asian materials for example are dangerously concentrated in a few unusually vulnerable institutions and a wider distribution of critical materials must be one of our essential measures but we cannot be content with the protection of american holdings only we are the sharers of a civilization whose principle cultural treasures are in other and even more vulnerable countnres and one cannot escape some sense of responsibility for their preservation the obvious
 the library quarterly and attractive proposal is a vast microfilming program which will at once assure the safekeeping of the texts of materials abroad enrich and broaden the resources of american scholarship and facilitate the duplication of materials for use anywhere unhappily the grandeur and simplicity of such a proposal are surpassed only by its impossibility i do not in fact think that there is any step american libraries can take which will make measurable progress toward assuring the preservation of the generality of unique and important research materials abroad we can of course help to film selected bits of transcendent importance for the rest perhaps our wisest course is to concentrate our efforts on doing what we can toward restoring and maintaining the vigor of institutions abroad dedicated to the continuity of enlightenment recognizing this as far more important in the long run than the safety or loss of any particular documents  we need to apply all our bibliothecal skill to certain critical problems of documentation in the field of science and technology for a variety of reasons the normal patterns of communication in those fields have broken down or have become inadequate to present needs the research report often confidential always in few copies and addressed to a supenor or a contracting agency rather than to one colleagues is tending to supplant the journal article as the characteristic record of scientific and technical discovery the accessibility of this vast sub literature is of critical and growing importance in addition the greatly enlarged and highly organized prosecution of scientific research has set up demands for the bibliographical control cf scientific literature of quite a new order of intensity and detail library classification schemes and subject heading lists including those of the library of congress have responded inadequately to these demands a consequence is the effort of individual disciplines or even individual agencies or projects to solve their own bibliographic problems individually and without the aid of general competence in the field the attainment of bibliographic order in the fields of science and technology is an essential in our national defense to which librarians can make an indispensable contribution  a third war measure is to improve radically our holdings of foreign materials not only extensively in the sense of developing collections from those countries such as thailand or rumania now very poorly represented but intensively in the sense of acquiring from countries already liberally represented such as france those informal and nonacademic publications outside the book trade which are so indispensable to that detailed knowledge of other countries which our growing responsibilities require again it is not a matter only of acquiring the sole or few copies necessary for intelligence or related research needs it is a question also of developing a network of research collections capable of sustaining the greatly enlarged teaching and research program which must be developed in the universities to enable us to deal intelligently with the remote areas that have become of such critical importance to the united states related to this aim is the necessity of greatly improving the organization and bibliographical control of collections in other languages than those of western europe because we have had few users and fewer catalogers of these materials they are under deplorable control in most institutions and the difficulties are compounded by the absence or inadequacy of
war measures past and future  bibliographical tools in those languages we need intensified and co operative cataloging programs and area accession lists in those languages  a fourth measure necessary to the execution of the preceding three is the establishment of more effective machinery for realizing the united potentialities of the national library system viewed as a whole the board on resources of american libraries of the american library association the board on cataloging policy and research of that association division of cataloging and classification and the farmington plan committee of the association of research libraries all fill important parts of this need but we need some more general body representing government and scholarship as well as librarianship capable of giving thoughtful and continuing attention to the co operative measures required to make national research resources most fully responsive to national needs a promising beginning is shown in the creation of the committee on national needs of the association of research libraries which may be a step toward the more comprehensive and permanently staffed body that the situation requires  a fifth measure in response to the times is a fuller participation by american libraries in developing and executing programs for assistance to and collaboration with foreign libraries and learned and technical institutions a strong library system can aid those countries friendly to us in all the ways in which it can aid our own more particularly one of the most crucial perhaps the crucial point in our race against chaos is rapid improvement of the technology of underdeveloped areas in order to avert collapse and to draw them into more equal participation in the benefits of western civilization even the puny gestures we have hitherto made in the point four program have demonstrated how staggeringly inadequate to this task are our resources of expert manpower and how fully every auxiliary means of technical instruction and training and of self help must be employed the nascent library system of those underdeveloped countries particularly the libraries of institutions of technical education can be a very powerful instrument of technical assistance one of the most fruitful measures of american libraries will be to aid such institutions through every possible channel private and official and to press for a far more vigorous and intelligent use of library materials and methods in technical assistance programs  finally we come to what i am satisfied is the most important measure of all that american libraries can take in response to the demands of our time that is to continue to be themselves as i tried on another occasion to express the idea every great library in the discharge of its elemental function of bringing together in a single collection the products of minds of all countries is not only a symbol but an embodiment of a universal commonwealth a part of the indivisible fabric of knowledge of which civilization is formed and by which it is sustained that voluntary association of human minds toward a common end which must be the basis of any free world order finds no clearer expression than in the work of such a library in the troubled years ahead it will almost certainly be a task of great difficulty to maintain in adversity the scope and strength of our major libraries and to preserve from the attacks of bigotry and hysteria their essential freedom but as long as we do the war against darkness will not have been lost i lacy op cit p
