the library quarterly volume xvi april  number  the american library abroad a medium of international intellectual exchange richard h heindel the american library in london is country has pioneered in expanding library services for its own public it turned naturally and wisely to exploring the uses of libraries as an instrument in an international program the american library in london conceived in august and established in december i by the office of war information in the united states embassy was the first official library outside continental united states it has been preceded by the privately managed american library in paris  and the benjamin franklin library opened in mexico city april  i through a grant to the american library association by the department of state thus it became a pilot project for other office of war information libraries and information centers throughout the world it was the first library energetically open to the public in any embassy anywhere in the world nvhen the office of war information went out of existence the american library in london along with other informational services was transferred to the jurisdiction of the department of state assistant secretary benton now places an objective of sixty five library centers high in the program of international information and cultural affairs in january  a division of libraries and institutes was established in the department of state the objectives of these outpost libraries have been the same they deal in facts and solidly documented explanations on the assumption that the more the truth about america is known and understood the better for all concerned in varying degrees depending on their origins adaptability to foreign situations management size and experience they blend the familiar characteristics of reading rooms public and special libraries reference centers and information offices the american library in london now has among its constant users all branches of the united states government and all british and other government agencies and subdivisions in great britain it has built relations with about eight hundred organizations and societies and three hundred and fifty business firms it has worked through and with about a hundred and seventy five libraries it has touched most of the schools larger private schools training colleges on through to the universities with some regard for regional coverage 
 the library quarterly the library s reiationship with the british press by systematic use a very large portion of the american library collection has become the basis of printed comment perhaps in england more than anywhere else it has been shown how much library material can become source material for current comment if some effort is made to assist the whole range of publications to whose use it can be adapted one dare not undervalue the significance of such spontaneous comment especially since the library has no branches and since the office of war information did almost no mass distribution of its own within the british isles nearly all the daily the sunday and to a lesser extent the provincial press and magazines including the trade and technical press have become regular clients of the library in spite of the fact that because of a division of labor with other sections of the british division of the office of war information certain areas are not directly cultivated by the library staff the library does not write special articles or make extensive original research reports it blends and suggests the raw materials the office record of printed comment is unsystematic and incomplete because nothing short of a cumbersome and expensive clipping service would give adequate coverage some of the items issued for example through the news division turn up in print several steps removed from the library and are difficult to document nor is it easy to ascertain the use made of library materials by authors who have drawn on these resources for their books or by agencies charged with preparing publications for europe the staff must rely on imagination spot checks on british newspapers and periodicals and correspondence to appraise the trends perhaps it should be explained before proceeding further that the staff examines nearly every page and item which comes into the library with this question in mind what four or five persons in great britain should be notified immediately that such and such is here and who can make the most use of it often but not exclusively this assists the publications which put some value on news on freshness and this is true especially where so much print never reaches the cables or where many items are missed and hence remain for some time unique or rare all of this may seem like dull work it is not a thorough examination of the whole process becomes an appraisal of intellectual cross currents as exciting as being on crowded cross roads of life and mind flowing in is the wealth of american life in print sifted by such vagaries as the atlantic passage war wartime shipping and budgets and one works within the british community which never lends itself to easy explanations the raw materials with which we work are books magazines and documents published in the united states each item has its own peculiarities and each class of publication its own more general characteristics it is not that one has to make translations but rather adjustments for use and questions continually come up what will critics do about american books not yet generally available do the british specialists already know the american specialized magazines do they know the general magazines that might occasionally be of greater interest to them where do hearings before congress fit in with the ponderous monographs there is the cold fact or information or experience unaltered inthe text clear and subject to
the american library abroad  international consideration but where does it stand in its country of origin irrespective of such matters which can be explored there is always the problem of using the diversified materials wisely especially those records which the united states produces normally for its own use or enjoyment to record its life experience achievements its critical explorations no one country can absorb all of another country not even its print one fundamental question now that we are interested in the free flow of data and in the understanding overseas of our country is whether we should be nervously concerned with our domestic output lest it completely mislead the world or be interpreted to mean what we think we do not mean on the basis of our experience in england the answer is that we need not be unduly concerned certainly not to the extent of making potboilers for export we ought not to trim and cut and especially not to tailor to suit the whimsies of foreign countries one may have to alter the sound track of our movies but not the printed page nothing that has happened in england need lead us to censor ourselves severely in order to contribute our share to the total international flow of data at the most it has indicated some areas in which we could usefully add to our national output the range of subjects and types of documentation surrounded by a pocket of americana in an american embassy one is forced to muse on developments in the homeland to what extent has the war forced or retarded the expression or cultivation of fields of knowledge clearly some ground has continued to be plowed that england had to neglect after long years of war but the output remains varied confusing satisfying annoying slightly biased slightly strident here and there much man power even thought power still goes into expression new experiences are being put into print censorship at home has not been such as to cause misgivings overseas more than any other country we air our dirty linen and show how we are washing it there is still a luxurious padding upon original research and thought the work of the years of i  is still creeping into print one becomes proud of the vigor shown often the appeal is sufficient to draw the emphasis away from science technology economics and american opinions toward thought belles lettres general literature even sociology very often the commonplace is not commonplace when exported the very local unheralded item may have a place just as important as the best seller the well thumbed desk handbook may be a great discovery in foreign parts the wares are good and they are getting better no student of comparative history would hazard the guess that everything has universal meaning or relevance but the wares make the purveyor proud especially in a community in which one can also be proud of the native products the chances seem good that in the vast quantity from an articulate country there will be many items of quality that strike a response beyond our boundaries and at the worst sometimes what is meaningless in content is suggestive in format the american book output is not out of line with the trends of interest in england indeed given the opportunity certain books could probably swamp the british market in spite of many obstacles because the native books have been delayed by the shortage of paper or
 the library quarterly of authors moreover the american university presses and many of our organizations and institutions seem to have a wider range and a greater wealth in output this is one way of saying that in a pinch one seems able to find an american book on any subject or area of lifea fact which makes it easier to share our experience and which frequently leads to fruitful foreign appraisal a book once launched is very much like an idea no one can quite ascertain the result it may not be known at all abroad or it may regardless of merit contribute more abroad than at home in the two and a half years since the library began probably no book as influential as das kapital or the origin of species or the institutes has passed through the mechanism yet we may be wrong in making this judgment without overemphasizing the value of current products or accepting publishers blurbs we must admit the possibility that in their applicability to this generation in their bearing upon important events some of them may turn out to be works of comparable stature one observation is reaffirmed by work overseas namely that american scholarship writing ability and good publishing with few exceptions have not got together to produce the short broadgauged expert well illustrated easily translatable exposition of any aspect of american life or thought our magazines will hold their own and so will the heavy monographs and the basic histories running to  pages and more and more the pamphlets but there is a gap in the middle zone the ioo page region which would help the foreigners to begin and which surely would not harm the domestic population an exception can be made perhaps by citing some of our textbooks used for collateral reading but it is not very complimentary to rely solely on material addressed to juveniles juvenility is not the same as brevity or simplicity there is a definite lack of short but adult books on for example american agriculture sports rivers history medical progress clubs birds music literature lakes states politics courts eating habits women or any of the five hundred industries if our concern with explanation overseas forces the growth of this mature distillation and writing we shall be lucky here and there now and then some subjects are covered more fully in american writings this is true of certain fields of science and technology of fuller explanations of industry and social life and of the detailed study of mass education and communications sometimes a problem met with early in the united states has produced a useful account for london as a center of an empire the tva many portions of agricultural bibliography race relations and the like sometimes it would seem that an unduly large portion of our sociological studies never escape from the specific problem into a broader social context but this does not necessarily displease the expert our simple technical handbooks as well as many of our school textbooks equipped with various teaching devices are sometimes suggestive clearly great credit accrues to the united states as our native publishing industry and scholarship widen their coverage of knowledge of other countries it should not have to be repeated that overseas it is just as important in our contribution to know not only the rivers of america but what the people on those rivers write about rivers of the world this may explain why such items as the two volume eminent chinese of the chng period or the letters of mary
the american library abroad  w shelley or the scholar and the future of the research library or english social history written by an eminent english historian but available first to the american public can interest the daily press of london and in a context which stimulates further exploration of whatever is in the american library general and trade and technical periodicals form the two major classes of the six hundred american magazines received at the library both reflect less wartime austerity in size staff content and illustrations than do comparable british periodicals naturally the general more popular magazines are used constantly for background data and for special articles many of our popular magazines in native editions are well known here especially the national geographic but are not so widely available as in peacetime in this sense the library copies have a premium value and much can be done to draw these magazines to the attention of journalists editors and others who often find them of important professional interest in carrying on their own jobs it is probably true that american magazines are being cited more frequently within copyright limitations in both classes there has been an increase in requests for exchange copies very often the flow of these magazines to important editorial points in england is not so comprehensive as one might expect hence the increased value of working with a wide range of such periodicals in one place there are many american magazines of both classes which do not have opposite numbers in england but this does not imply that there is not an important even though small audience for such journals the presence of this variety of magazines also encourages and helps british writers to judge possible american outlets for their products generally the aim has been to acquaint more of the british public with the variety of the american periodical output perhaps higher returns have come from directing attention to magazines that do not have mass circulation at home and do not seem to be sufficiently well known in england in this category one could mention saturday review of literature federal reserve bulletin foreign commerce weekly business week hospital corps quarterly public opinion quarterly american literature national parent teacher school and society monthly labor review infantry journal survey graphic book review digest books a broad journal of home economics editor and publisher public administration review and indeed nearly all the specialized journals in every field often conscientious students of american opinion have not seen a sufficient sampling of our magazines of controversy and opinion british editors of religious periodicals do not always see even their denominational counterparts our publications in the social field offer outlets that do not exist in england at the moment this may make less easy the formal reporting of the contents of such journals but the long term influence is great even though such social reporting is not yet so highly specialized in great britain in any one or two magazines our trade journals have an added appeal because they seem to reflect the fuller reporting which is often described by foreigners as a special characteristic of american industry american magazines represent a very rich mine that requires more digging than can be expected even from the foreigner who is enthusiastic or personally
 the library quarterly committed to following the world output in certain subjects or types of magazines abstracting may help a few but someone like a traffic manager with few prejudices and a personal touch has here a job to do for some years to come special overseas editions at their most expensive development would be possible for only a very small part of the american output britons and americans not concerned with publishers gymkhanas can nevertheless foresee no contusions from any improvement in circulation even at home the range and location of official publications of the federal government are bewildering if to this we add the many significant items from the forty eight states we have a major problem of unfreezing frozen documents yet in these official publications of which the library has a fair sample are recorded many of the most important aspects of our life in a rich though sometimes forbidding way if we recall the endless possibilities of extension of remarks in the congressional record there is almost no subject which is not covered the scope has remained wider than that of the publications of his majesty stationery office under war circumstances the federal documents are not copyrighted which means greater freedom of use overseas they are also very frank to the extent that one must be cautious in countries where libel laws are strict it is quite true also that unlike those of some other countries our official publications are so varied that these documents cannot always be described as statements of policy more often they are the preliminaries for the conclusions they are in many ways the public tutor of a vast and democratic country the existence of the publications of the national resources planning board is still an important fact despite the death of the issuing body as at home but of course to a greater degree many types of documents have been practically unused in england hearings before congress court reports our intelligence reports on other countries and so on there are often news and human interest in these documents which vary from one page to a few thousands they are not always so statistical as allegedwitness the marshall report on the army and the first report by the director of war mobilization but a traffic manager is needed here even more than with magazines it would be too much to say that one could have a good library composed solely of our official publications but it would not be useless we have not been in the habit of making these inexpensive documents easy for the american to buy it has been different in england where the population is accustomed to have the official publications offered for sale through official shops as well as through booksellers this makes even more interesting the arrangement whereby his majesty stationery office acts as a sales agent for the publications of the government printing office but more relevant to the topic of this essay is the fact that from time to time during the last two years the stationery office has reprinted united states official publications ten to date now and then where the reprint has been wanted for a smaller or more specialized audience the reprinting has been done by an association for example the report on interregional highways which was issued in england by the cement and concrete association there is every reason to believe that several of these documents have sold more widely in great britain
the american library abroad than in the united states this sales and reprinting agreement has emphasized in the information program the use of the normal not the ad hoc government document perforce the news significance of many of these documents when issued in the united states is missed by foreign correspondents who anyway could not cable in great detail the editor and the journalist often prefer the full text for study and it has happened frequently that with a little regard for local needs publications as much as two years old have been brought to light one could cite many examples such as the various temporary national economic committee hearings and monographs which have only now received the study they merit obviously there is a rush for any item which has been mentioned in cables from the united states and this is usually an opportune time to draw attention to several other documents which have not been so honored this clearly illustrates the point that the fuller the examination of such documents in print at home the more probable it is that such documents will ultimately receive attention abroad hence anything which expedites the sharing of the federal documentation with the whole american public sooner or later makes the dissemination overseas that much easier also the cabling of full texts wherever possible should be encouraged but there are obvious limitations to this process quite frankly with the exception possibly of the daily weather charts practically nothing issued by the federal and state governments should be considered as too local to be of possible interest and even the daily weather charts which happen to drift in can put reality into the classroom study of the united states the bureau of labor statistics for example has prepared studies on various communities and the impact of the war on such communities as an aid to local planning groups these on first sight seem very local indeed yet they show how federal resources can help and when the communities under study are matched with communities with similar problems in great britain or with industrial specialities trade and local journals will squeeze space for comment the wide range and hidden wealth of unofficial pamphlets documents reports and the like require even more attention and are more difficult to use fully generally these categories have never been handled by commercial channels because of little hope of profit and it is difficult to see any improvement in the future whether pamphleteering has increased and improved in the united states during the war may be a question but certainly much of the life of america is put into this form and into many organizational reports and limited near print editions one might presume that american pamphlets and particularly organizational reports would have some circulation because of the natural interest of corresponding groups or organizations in england and there is a great value if contact between such groups can be established outside of the library here we are citing primarily those vast numbers of publications which transcend the group for which they were written in the united states many of our booklets and pamphlets are examples of the vast enlightenment or convincing process that must go on in a democracy and these often are important for both method and content there are wide areas of publications
i the library quarterly which are difficult to follow in the united states even with such an index as the vertical file service or various tradecatalog services but this is not a reason to suppose that special attention should not be drawn to such items overseas it is often the ten page mimeograph report that properly handled results in a healthful two way exchange and the pamphlet often more easily understood abroad than a book and sometimes more adaptable for translation should not be snubbed merely because it is as difficult for a library to handle as a book also without trying to estimate their numbers not many annual reports of our more national organizations are so barren of interest as not to strike a response given some special care many of these publications are either free or very inexpensive and hence are not given much care by commercial agents in using such documentation full explanations are frequently needed to guide the foreign users to place such publications in true perspective this is a heavy responsibility because of the great variety of issuing agencies yet this very variety of purpose size representation and methods is one reason for the world significance of american life and the process of explanation can become a practical way to approach american history further once there is a fair number of overseas libraries the home servicing base gets more returns for the pains taken to canvass this field and the issuing agencies themselves should attempt to meet legitimate overseas interests the range of british publications before discussing the wartime peculiarities of the british publications let us first look at the general characteristics as they affect the work we have been trying to do there is not much language difficulty there is a national daily press which tends to obscure the very important role of the provincials the press is a free press there is a great variety which may not however include certain specialities for which the united states has become well known the printing and publishing industry which has its ups and downs as does ours is a proud one and perhaps is much more conscious of the importance of overseas readers the tenor of much of the publishing is slightly different from ours because of the libel laws the industry even in normal times would seem to achieve its output with fewer persons and lower costs in all branches of the business but it is the severe print and staff shortage coincident with the war that is important this coupled with an abnormality of communications has been the principal wartime influence which conditions this aspect of our work these factors are at work in newspapers periodicals and books in house organs members bulletins and the like the print shortage means that newspapers economize carefully on what could normally be turned into background and feature material magazines cannot always do justice to data which otherwise would appeal to them book publishers cannot let themselves get excited by a wide variety of books they would like to import or publish both the staff shortages and the abnormality of communications tend however to increase the value of whatever the library can do in spotting and circulating information in addition the library must have some knowledge of the editorial preferences and readers interests this is more important than a close scrutiny of audited circulations where they exist the writers and free lance
the american library abroad ioi journalists as well as the editors can be helped by the library so far as our own work is concerned we must sense the diffusion and pulling power of the various outlets often that appraisal must lead us to suggest data which do not at first sight seem directly of interest to this or that outlet for example a substantial study on housing by a trade union may be wanted for evaluation by an architectural a general labor a trade union or an adult education paper and even under peacetime communications one can be fairly certain that such an item does not reach overseas the entire professional audience which desires to know obviously the london daily press is interested in cabled information from their own correspondents or the press agencies or the news division which works closely with the library often the news division can supplement its cabled output by general releases to the press based on documentation which comes by mail on occasion as with willkie one world the press is informed that a complete text is available for consultation in the library there are always limitations on what can be brought by cable by any agency in war or peace and this would indicate that the library can always perform certain news roles as far as the daily press is concerned over and above the reference queries the answers to which filter into print that are but a part of the daily library routine the press has browsed through the library or has been informed of certain new accessions and both of these activities will net ever increasing results as the papers gain more space and specialties the sunday press which is based in london does not differ much in this respect except that perhaps it will always be more receptive to data which can make or help features except to the extent that library data reach the provincial press through agency releases the library service to that portion of the press must be done in a more intimate way usually by correspondence but here there is always an x quantity of service that may be performed of a type which illustrates further the active role of interpretation which is encouraged on the part of editors and writers who have adequate data before them there are a few columnists who write for a string of provincial papers one of them augur has constantly referred to our books and documents and where it has seemed possible for us to cope with the demand he has asked readers to get in touch with us by way of their local libraries our lending by post has often proved its value in print the general weekly monthly and quarterly magazines have different needs some have mass circulation others have very little they are more likely to benefit by the breadth of the documentation available here is where a specimen selection of publications on some topic often results in a basic article the technique of spotting specialized information does not profit so much as with the trade and technical press it is in this latter field that much has been accomplished these journals often editorialize more than do similar american magazines so that such data are used for something more than technical abstracting or reporting such use also stimulates the requests for illustrations i would not care to discuss the relative diffusion power of the general magazines and those magazines which appeal to specialized audiences some british observers lament what they call the weak power and status of these general maga
 the library quarterly zines especially those of opinion they say the weeklies the monthlies and the quarterlies have slipped new magazines are always being planned some of them seem to represent a combination of appeals which closely resembles that of certain american magazines and as in the field of social work previously mentioned they may conceivably furnish new outlets for american items that at the moment are not easily marked for special attention there is a tradition which has some merits that magazines will not review books our reference copies which are not given to them as review copies or are not available to purchasers immediately in quantity with shipping and shortages what they are this is a most serious block to an appraisal of the american output american publishers and their british literary or publishing agents often have good commercial reasons for not wishing a preliminary listing or noting that such and such an item exists even though experts and other consumers might want this knowledge one must remember however that even under conditions of normal supply the greater percentage of american books will not be published in england or even imported in any quantity and many of these are news and vital to the flow of knowledge and to the projection of the united states and should not go unnoted for each item that suffers in remaining unpublished or unimported because of some preliminary appraisal which might be critical to state one of the strongest arguments for this tradition one could adduce a hundred contrary examples which would have benefited commercially both british and american principals to say nothing of the general public obviously there are good reasons if one can manage to have a spare copy or so to help in this process which may often take the form of encouraging interested editors or reviewers to apply for review copies directly through established channels where appropriate some of these books are treated as news or a basis for comments rather than as formal reviews which may or may not usually not come later this technique lessens the irritations of the readers who we are told would rather not know a book exists if they cannot get it and safeguards editors who think they might be sued for commenting on something not sent directly by the issuing agent for comment perhaps the wide range of our collection is most useful to british literary agents book importers and publishers who serve in a long term way so long as our collection is up to date and comprehensive perhaps more so with nonfiction than with fiction which tends to have more momentum of its own all such persons have a wider area upon which to exercise choice and discrimination and to calculate profit this applies both to well established firms with impressive lists and long connections with the united states and to newer firms which no doubt may have more need for guidance the selection of books for publishing overseas or translation has always seemed a haphazard process governed by many motives and factors and anything which can assist or stimulate even modestly will help both the industry and the public nay even the creative writer on both sides of the atlantic thus the library helps provide stimulation for more american books with bntish imprints but this is not its only service to the book trade in the books by british authors in yearbooks in revisions of encyclopedias and standard
the american library abroad  reference books the use of our collection often tums up in acknowledgments prefaces and footnotes we need not labor this point because all libraries of any significance attempt to give special help to the writer there are association bulletins house organs wall newspapers abstracts and bibliographies which are often more important than their appearance would suggest for example the editor of a confidential mimeographed bulletin which goes to at least fifty leading executives draws heavily and wisely on our resources and his advice brings requests to us for borrowing and to his own office for spare copies from every part of the british isles this particular bulletin did much to convey ideas those which were public property not secrets to benefit the joint war effort hansard which is like our congressional record contains the proceedings of parliament where one may often find american items referred to by members in question time or debate where members on their own initiative do cite some document or book the general response would show that this is an important bibliographical citation because of the foreign language press in england much of the library material has become familiar to continental editors and readers who often for the first time have been brought into touch with the american output one might mention the biuletyn of the association of polish technicians in great britain sometimes because of the facilities of london as a communications center press agencies travelers and others have carried by print the information they found in this library into india egypt new south wales switzerland sweden and west africa in all these activities connected with these many outlets copyright and the proprieties have been maintained the role of the library and trends in its use this institution can be described in part as a special library for the british community it could have been merely a reading room or a lending library within limits it attempts to give to the components of the community the same attention as a company library may give to its directors naturally there are limitations to the amount of personal service but common sense would dictate that the press which serves this nation should get high priority as one organism in a framework of international information programs and intellectual co operation no one can minimize the practical working base that a library can give to real and reciprocal co operation it can be something of a common meeting ground appealing to all types and tastes likewise every effort is directed toward stimulating an active native interest in the documentation and not toward pauperizing by doing detailed research or other chores which other people are paid to do it might be impressive if we could give countless items to editors and the like it might be alleviating if we re wrote here and there but certainly the end result is better if we have encouraged and helped others to put this documentation into their native channels in their own idiom and sometimes by ways which have been not usual but certainly not dishonest in time these methods might recapture something of the universal world of information which the encyclopedists dreamed of and which some early scientists tried to convey by handwritten correspondence there might even in time be devices
 the library quarterly such as the microcards books and documents co operatively classified on cards with the text photographed on the reverse side which could cope with the problems of copyright and research and the wealth of print all at one stroke we have tried by reading conversations hints and rumors to gain some indication of the fields of interest of the british publications and those who write for them we have tried to watch incoming additions with their possible interests in mind and have without burdensome insistence drawn these items to their attention we have watched for news pegs in short as information specialists we have conceived of our job as that of an editor or reader for a great chain of publications and the library collection as a vast reservoir of manuscripts which are seeking readers american and other readers of an analysis such as this are always strongly curious about the trends of inquirieswho wants this or that information and why two and a half years experience in the library has indicated several general trends which i shall try to summarize briefly documentation is being referred to for increasingly serious purposes the proportion of elementary questions has declined rapidly persons who are becoming at home with publications which they had never used express surprise and some regrets for their previous oversight presumably this may have happened because some of the data have possessed a scarcity value which evokes a response even in a tough skinned journalist almost without exception users of all shades of opinion have examined and used this material within a framework of good journalism and professional integrity even though the item in question may have been counter to theiror our staff opinions or knowledge great britain has had a coalition government but i doubt whether this has any bearing on what i have observedthat we are used about equally by the conservative labour and liberal press the subject fields of military affairs industry economics education science international relations politics and american opinions have attracted more attention than art or music or literature but not much more than the very broad aspects of american life which might be classified as history a few persons are averse to using american documentation but i do not detect any common charateristics among them they may be professional people or they may be free lancers they may be poor or rich radical or conservative there is another thing that awakens interest in american life and that is the periodic examnination of social questions in parliament and public a debate on housing or education or health insurance in parliament starts a great many questions as to how we deal with these matters in america to say that one cannot predict with assurance the tenor of the conclusions that will be drawn by british commentators with american data before them is not to say that an information program is haphazard the dynamic influence of sound information is justified in the long run if we define the impact of the united states so as to include i the knowledge of or interest in the united states  the opinions and attitudes about the united states and  the imitation modification or use of the american experience we may apply this analysis more limitedly to the role of american

the american library abroad  the british booklet will be at least as comprehensive and easy to understand as the american counterpart some of the technical manuals produced by our war department might just as well be marked secret because they are usually an unknown quantity to civilians editors have been glad to see these i am certain considerable good was done for anglo american relations by getting long notices on tm lo  which was another name for cooking dehydrated foods  but enough of these illustrations there are two general observations in conclusion judging from the few appraisals one can find the american people cannot yet be fully aware of the overseas influences exerted by the printed matter which is so familiar to them the influences will differ in every quarter of the globe in a community as sturdy and sophisticated as great britain one can be certain there will be healthy absorption not an addled overabsorption for mutual advantage the second point is that libraries or should we stress the human element librarians can view the years ahead with a renewed sense of imagination service and vigor granted this they can claim to be one of the proudest and liveliest of the works of man
