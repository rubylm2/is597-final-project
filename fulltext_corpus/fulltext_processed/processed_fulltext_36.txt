behavior of librarians in school and public libraries with adolescents implications for practice and us education mary k chelton a study of service encounters between adult library staff and adolescent users drawing on the communication theories of erving goffman michael lipsky and hartmut mokros is reported from three data sources a content analysis of professional guides to conduct group interviews with adult library staff and adolescents and taped observations of professional and clerical encounters in a high school library professional guides to practice are predominantly prescriptive advocating the avoidance of behaviors admittedly prevalent in practice adults and adolescents are congruent on what they want out of ideal encounters but admit to stereotypical views of the other based on age and appearance service is found to be multidimensional primarily clustered in very short interactions when classes change more predominantly concerned with help with equipment and less than half of what staff do in the high school library an equal amount of time is allocated to enforcement activities none of which is alluded to in professional guides to conduct influences of technology on practice and rhetoric on reality are discussed service encounters have become a major concern of contemporary organizations nearly  percent of new jobs created in the s were in services and  percent of private sector employees now work in service businesses osborne devotes much of reinventing government to ways in which government can improve services to citizens and there has been persistent interest in total quality management tqm for improving service quality in the public sector including libraries for the last decade recent library and information science lis research includes a study measuring the service quality of academic library services addressing service solely in managerial instrumental terms however understates the importance of this activity especially when it is becoming one which occupies a significant portion of any given individual time in modern society as a basic form of social interaction spring  
 journal of education for library and information science about the author mary k chelton is associate professor graduate school of library and information studies queens college flushing new york this article is based on the research for the author dissertation which was a cowinner of the  alise doctoral student dissertation competition in everyday life service encounters signify human relationships where a sense of the larger community is fostered through a familiar shared ritual harris suggests that the service ethic of the profession is being eroded as librarianship becomes more aligned with the information professions with an increased emphasis on information technology gutek speculates that the current transition toward anonymous or pseudorelational technologically enhanced or substituted service encounters in all fields may possibly help account for contemporary society lack of kindness random acts of violence and pervasive alienation and disaffection such observations should be of particular concern to lis educators preparing practitioners to serve youth since they appear to be identical to current social indicators for that population goffman calls the service transaction the paradigmatic exemplar available for analyzing the interaction order or face to face interactive domain this is where social life  who we are in relation to each other  is constructed service encounters draw upon a wider and often taken for granted cultural context involving government protocol traffic rules and other formalizations of precedence that create expectations of equal treatment this is apparent in the variety of interactive resources employed to cope with different social statuses to manage queues fairly and to display a courteous demeanor underlying these rules are a variety of unstated assumptions about who can qualify as a serious candidate for service goffman suggests that four critical diffuse statuses in our society  age gender class and race  provide a cross cutting grid on which individuals can be placed and offer identification markers in social situations where no other identification is available the study reported here looked at how age enters into the qualifying rules of the service situation especially how one is recognized as qualified or disqualified for service through seemingly mundane communication practices the age categories examined were adolescent library users between twelve and eighteen and adult library service staff analytic framework this study drew primarily on the analytical perspectives of erving goffman michael lipsky and hartmut mokros lynn mullins and tefco saracevic these theorists view the social situation as a ritual that is choreographed by unseen largely unconscious and taken for granted rules through which people fit their developing lines of conduct to one another goffman  work emphasizes the nature of face to face interaction how one presents oneself socially how one frames redefines and transforms social situations and how discrediting social attributes attached to one are socially managed lipsky is interested in how frontline service workers in public sector organizations use their discretionary power in institutional client control routines mokros mullins and saracevic examine ways in which communicative activity volume  number

 journal of education for library and information science simultaneous but different levels of analysis of the service encounter phenomenon from a communication perspective the professional guides provided the overall public discourse within which practice is taught and conceptualized or in foucault terms an archaeology of recommended idealized practice within which actual practice takes place the interactive data set provided the analytical level of lived experience or the display setting for professional discourse observing face to face interaction provided a window on the hidden or virtual discourse of practice this is the level of analysis where the institutional constraints noted by lipsky collide with idealized rhetoric so that any working accommodation between the two might best be observed a third data set addressed perceptions of service held by adults and adolescents providing insights into how individuals have reflected upon and given meaning to past service experiences these data offer access to yet another level of influence on interaction  self reflection the pubyac e mail responses provided other examples of the continued disconnection between promulgated and enacted theories of practice as well as adult provider attitudes toward adolescents their purpose is primarily illustrative although they add corroboration to the perceptual data from the focus group interviews analytic approach the specific method used was microanalysis of naturally occurring everyday library service encounters for comparison with both user and provider perceptions of recalled service encounters and professionally recommended standards of practice for such encounters the emphasis was on how language is situated in particular circumstances of social life and on how it adds or reflects different types of meaning expressive instrumental and structure eg interactional institutional to those circumstances the primary microanalytic method employed in this study was ethnographic that is the creation of a detailed description of observed behavior from which the meaning of the behavior for the participants could be interpreted this process observed what the participants seemed to be accomplishing by their communicative actions in particular the ways in which the interactive situation was being defined detailed codings of the content categories in the transcripts of each interaction were aggregated under work activity types to describe exactly how time was spent by library staff findings and discussion what service should be professional discourse seven widely distributed lis policy statements on professional conduct and related texts adopted and published by ala between  and  were analyzed for what they said practice should be see appendix in essence these documents say that service may be summarized primarily as all the ways one provides links between users and resources learning understanding interpretation of the resources etc are individual assets generally expected to be present in or acquired by the user after being provided the link with the right material or service these guides to professional conduct also say that library staff are expected to initiate contact with and relate consistently and equitably to individual and diverse users with courtesy energy enthusiasm understanding respect and tolerance users are persons who bring to staff wants and needs which are then to be filled to the satisfaction of the user five out of the seven statements are volume  number

behavior of librarians in school and public libraries with adolescents  about them the same is true with enforcement queries implications for practice and preservice education concepts of service while there is nothing inherently wrong with promulgating idealized standards for practice they do not help practitioners whose everyday life can never meet the standard none of the texts examined alludes to the pass system in schools which has become so ubiquitous and normalized that several school librarians were amazed at the researcher surprise over the amount of time the school library staff spent enforcing it in discussions with the librarian at the research site she made it clear that she had to live with the pass system as district policy and tried to make it as unonerous as possible for all concerned which the observational data fully corroborate the lack of attention to the daily reality of school libraries in this regard negates the effect of the rhetoric of the guidelines and may be a reason why they are frequently ignored in practice in information power for example had some attention been given to the possible distractions and labor costs of as well as the time allocated to managing an enforcement system school library media specialists might have found other recommended changes in their professional roles more palatable the entire issue of what equal treatment means in practice needs more attention than now provided in published guidelines especially since most of those texts promulgate barrier free service at the same time they admit that discrimination based on age is a prevalent barrier but do not describe in detail how these two things might be reconciled the selfcongratulatory nature of most professional library practice publishing encourages librarians to believe and repeat their own idealized rhetoric while client control routines in libraries go virtually unexamined and discussion of them either doesn take place or goes underground libraries with homogeneous and heterogeneous clientele ages may have different magnitudes of the same problem with age category stigmatization or they may have different problems the relationship between problems of practice and type of audience has not been examined within this framework idealized generic rhetoric or theory that pretends that all types of libraries are alike regardless of their service audiences is not particularly helpful to practitioners like those studied here who are trying to provide ideal service in a far from ideal everyday world there needs to be more attention to distinctions among library contexts rather than a continued and possibly faulty assumption that they are all alike in that they are a type of information system it is long past time that standards of practice and research studies took specific notice of the clerical presence in most libraries instead of subsuming or ignoring it under discussions about policies if lipsky is correct in his assessment of how street level bureaucracies work a great many idealized policies promulgated in published standards of practice get distorted into something else in discretionary clerical processes for many adolescents the adult clerk whom they first meet at the circulation desk is the institutional representative of the library and its policies the methodology used to gather naturally occurring data would help researchers and their practitioner audience to better understand what happens at clerical service desks in libraries multidimensionality of service concept based on the activity types amalgamated from the content coding of work activities spring 
 journal of education for library and information science of the librarian and library clerk this study shows that library service is a multidimensional concept encompassing many activities of which providing information may only be a small part while the current positioning of library work as part of the information professions may be politically useful in some areas in actual practice open to the public view of users information work is not all that librarians do in fact the data here suggest that some librarians do not provide information at all but define their role as assisting people to find information on their own given this frame the librarian bias toward user competence reported by radford is understandable but it is also not necessarily what professional rhetoric says that library practice is there should be further studies observing and comparing what those who call themselves information professionals actually do in practice division of labor in practice the question that arises from a comparison of the librarian activities and the circulation desk activities is why the professional and clerical division of labor categories is so blurred in this library and whether this is normal one explanation here is responsiveness to waiting users by whichever staff member is free and near the circulation desk especially since one staff member was sick the observed day another explanation is obviously the absorption of a technical support role by the librarian regardless of explanations in this particular context these data suggest that the librarian work rests atop a pyramid of other kinds of work which will be absorbed by the librarian if other workers are not available to do them enforcement of the pass system for example would have been delegated to a clerical staff member rather than to the librarian had the person not been sick the real everyday problem though is that staff can be sick frequently and if there are not enough of them propping up the librarian role it devolves into clerical or technical support work immediately how often this happens should possibly be a matter of concern otherwise the labor categories professional and clerical are observably meaningless to others this may be why so many users think anyone who works in a library is the librarian case studies of how this hierarchical arrangement works and where it has successfully been modified would give practitioners and their governing bodies a better idea of how work is or may be legitimately organized in libraries while it is obvious from table  that the average length of service encounters is generally longer than enforcement encounters the sheer number of the latter raises the question of the labor cost to the library and the school district of doing this especially when the activity devolves to higher paid staff when lower paid are absent even with a full complement of staff though it would be worth knowing how much of the labor cost is devoted to enforcement activity something totally unacknowledged in any published standards of practice influence of technology the distribution of activities under service suggests that the influence of increased technology has changed the service role of the librarian to a sort of technical assistant to users helping them to help themselves find information on machines by showing them how to make the machines work this is not information retrieval or teaching and instruction but rather a de skilling of real information work and possibly the inevitable result of a self service competent user framework embedded in the definition of library service particularly volume  number 
behavior of librarians in school and public libraries with adolescents  but not exclusively in school libraries regardless of what is causing this however this service activity as observed is not the information literacy work described in professional standards of practice and suggests that paraprofessional technical support for users is emerging in the library workplace but is being subsumed by professional librarians audits of work activities using the methodology and typology of the interaction part of this study may help working librarians not only to document the changes in the kinds of activities comprising their work but also the data needed to justify different positions summary library practitioners would do well to note that users remember more how they are treated in a service encounter than what they get from it regardless of the instrumental purpose of library service encounters they are also occasions of social engagement or what goffman would call status rituals of conduct which have symbolic implications for those involved these little everyday ceremonies not only include acts of service but also acts of deference in which the worth of the other person is conveyed since libraries share similar structural constraints with other public sector bureaucracies as well as constraints unique to library settings which affect the timing and nature of service encounters practitioners might look for transformative opportunities within them by acknowledging the existence of the constraints discussion can follow in classrooms and professional meetings about creative coping mechanisms including in some instances the possibility of dismissing them comments from the interview data show that adolescents already feel demeaned in many of their service encounters with adults and many adults assume that adolescents are already or are going to be problematic there is often little trust between them and adult service providers because of past negative experiences and stereotypical attributions being part of a stigmatized group adults find suspect is a normalized social experience outside the family for adolescents the separateness of belonging to an age category others want to avoid is reinforced in schools by age segregation and in public libraries either by delegating organizational responsibility to a special unit by architectural exclusion or by a standard of equal treatment which ignores adolescent individuality goffman calls this having a governmentally ratified personal identity and discusses those who deviate from the stigma attached to them by resistance in which they act irregularly and somewhat rebelliously in connection with our basic institutions he calls them the disaffiliates a possibly accurate description of adolescents and the problems libraries have with them giddens suggests that a stable sense of self identity is bound up in being able to trust others as part of building a coherent personal biography trust interpersonal relations and a conviction of the eality of things go hand in hand in the social settings of adult life each of the everyday experiences of ubiquitous service encounters is part of this process of learning who we are and how we are to live together helping an adolescent to use the photocopy machine or checking out a book or asking to see a pass may seem mundane and tedious to someone who does it constantly the young person receiving the service however is neither mundane nor tedious but rather another person who wants an emotional connection and respect providing library service spring 
  journal of education for library and information science without it is otherwise a very empty and possibly meaningless activity no matter how service is idealized within professional standards real service occurs in everyday settings where practical theories of how work is done and who it is done for are enacted in every encounter unless those practical theories are addressed in more studies that actually look at what happens in everyday contexts and how people on both sides of the encounter feel about it writing standards for practice becomes an exercise in futility at the association level for bridging a chasm that is possibly already too wide where adolescents are concerned references  robert reich the work of nations preparing ourselves for st century capitalism new york knopf     david e osborn reinventing government how the entrepreneurial spirit is transforming the public sector reading mass addisonwesley   william e deming out of the crisis cambridge mass mit press  danuta a nitecki changing the concept and measure of service quality in academic libraries journal of academic librarianship      john a czepiel michael r solomon carol f surprenant and evelyn g gutman service encounters an overview in service encounter managing employeecustomer interaction in service businesses ed john a czepiel michael r solomon carol f surprenant lexington mass lexington books   erving goffman interaction ritual essays on face to face behavior new york pantheon   roma harris librarianship the erosion of a woman profession norwood nj ablex   barbara a gutek dynamics of service reflections on the changing nature of customerprovider interactions san francisco jossey bass   erving goffman interaction order american sociological review    mary k chelton adult adolescent service encounters the library context phd diss rutgers university  llerving goffman presentation of self in everyday life new york doubleday  stigma notes on the management of spoiled identity new york simon  schuster  interaction ritual essays on face to face behavior new york pantheon  frame analysis an essay on the organization of experience boston northeastern university press  michael lipsky toward a theory of street level bureaucracy in theoretical perspectives on urban politics englewood cliffs njprenticehall  street level bureaucracy dilemmas of the individual in public services new york russell sage foundation  hartmut b mokros lynn s mullins and tefco saracevic practice and personhood in professional interaction social identities and information needs library and information science research     from information and behavior to interaction and identity in information and behavior vol  interaction  id en tity new brunswick nj transaction    deborah schiffrin approaches to discourse cambridge mass blackwell    michel foucault archaeology of knowledge the discourse on language trans a m sheridan smith new york pantheon   anthony giddens central problems in social theory berkeley calif university of california press    michael lipsky street level bureaucracy dilemmas of the individual in public services new york russell sage foundation   deborah schiffrin approaches to discourse cambridge mass blackwell    young adult library services association directions for library service to volume  number
