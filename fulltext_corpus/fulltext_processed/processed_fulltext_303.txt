  journal of education for library and information science life however there is less geographical and physical limitation and more mobility in sl which makes it an open field for experiences that are difficult to obtain in real life this appeals to educators in that it generates constructive experiences for students to reflect on and learn from for example one respondent mentioned that she organized class discussions where students talk about how feminist research methods can be applied in understanding gender and race formations and interpersonal interactions in sl another respondent had his students document and report their experiences with regard to accessibility for persons with disabilities in sl in both cases the students learning was advanced by the reflection on their sl experiences the second most popular n    motivation for educators to involve sl in their teaching practice is to use it as a venue to chat with all students at the same time the d virtual environment in sl is certainly a richly interactive venue for communication especially for classes where students are geographically dispersed furthermore the choice of meeting locations is quite flexible for example one respondent commented that he often took his students to a relaxing location for class meetings to create scenarios and simulations for students to practice skillsknowledge imparted in class is a popular reason to bring classes to sl as well n   as mentioned earlier sl is an environment for virtual reality and constitutes a solid basis for experiential learning thus educators design exercises and activities in sl for students to practice what they learn in class for example one respondent asked his students to use the skills learned in class to respond to business clients proposals produce deliverables and make presentations in sl another created simulations in sl so that his students could practice skills such as interviewing reporting journalistic researching publishing and circulation in other words sl is a fertile ground for field experience educators are also attracted to the possibilities of using sl as a venue for group projects and team building activities given the abundant resources available in sl n   one respondent talked about using a convenient sl feature note card to distribute topics of group discussions and asking each group to write their discussion summary in a note card and return them to the instructor another one mentioned the most popular team building activity in her sl classroom was a speed building challenge where the class was split into teams and each team was given just two hours to reconstruct a local landmark using their sl building skills however these collaborative experiences in sl are not limited to such intra class group work some instructors bring their classes to sl to meet with students and faculty from other institutions who share their teaching and learning interests for instance a respondent in china collaborated with a teacher in germany so that their english as a second language esl students could meet in sl and practice their english skills via discussions and exercises a number of respondents n   designated sl as a venue for students to

  journal of education for library and information science another two respondents considered sl to be an engaging environment the result of the creative and engaging aspect of sl is the increased student enthusiasm in learning one respondent mentioned that his students end products of the class have been ten times better than the same type of project run without any involvement of sl advantage  being a multi channel distance learning platform distance learning can benefit from sl as well three respondents reported that sl is a rich platform for distance learning and one of them even explicitly claimed that the ability for learner to learner interaction at a distance feels more resent than other distance learning venues this feature relates directly to research conducted with text chat which shows that a greater sense of presence leads to greater satisfaction advantage iv providing an informal and relaxing educational environment in sl classes can meet in non classroom settings where the environment is informal and relaxing for learning two respondents mentioned that the informal way of communicating the relaxed learning attitudes and creative and engaging aspects of sl motivated students active participation in class in terms of the difficulties and problems encountered when teaching in sl the opinions of respondents can be grouped into the following categories disadvantage  technical problems the first and foremost obstacle to bringing classes to sl is technical difficulty about  n   of the respondents mentioned a technical concern of one kind or another the three primary technical problems reported by respondents are lag time requirement for frequent updates and inadequate hardware equipment on both the student and the school end disadvantage  steep learning curve and slow student acceptance learning to skillfully navigate in sl is not an easy task six respondents reported that students have to go through a steep learning curve before they can comfortably have classes in sl disadvantage iii distractions in sl sl is a d virtual environment and it models the real world in its running thus the non educational part of sl can become distracting in the learning process among the three respondents who acknowledged this problem one stated that his students got distracted by avatar creation and other sl elements that are not related to education and another mentioned that his classes which were not held in a private space sometimes were interrupted by random people
