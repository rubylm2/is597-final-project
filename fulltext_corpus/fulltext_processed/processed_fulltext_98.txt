in  the gerberhart lesbian gay bisexual and transgender information resource and archives in chicago opened its doors to the public only five years later the quatrefoil library in st paul minnesota with assistance from the minnesota civil liberties union went public with more than fifteen hundred volumes of lgbt lesbian gay bisexual and transgendertransexual literature collected by david irwin and dick hewetson together they have become two of the largest lgbt circulating libraries in the united states followed by smaller sites and collections such as the stonewall library and archives in fort lauderdale florida and the james c hormel gay and lesbian center at the san francisco public library these spaces serve as the de facto guardians of collected lgbt knowledge heritage and historynarratives accessible for public consumptionbut in order for these spaces to benefit the lgbt community beyond their role as repository and site of private reading and contemplation readers must come together to discuss the texts whether informally or through the organized structure of a book club since oprah winfrey exposed her book club to international audiences in   commercial web sites such as book browse and the reading club have profited from advertising a host of advantages of joining discussion groups lifelong learning polished communication skills inspiration to write creatively the unification of families and so on as arbiters of cultural authority these clubs profess to guide participants through pleasurable and suitable reading experiences the literary guild and the bookofthemonth club since their inception have chosen appropriate books and provided advice on reading them in order to uphold bourgeois american values furthermore teachers rely on book clubs for shaping reading habits  and publishers such as penguin and harcourt administer reading guides to continue the effort once students leave the classroom  many studies suggest that these social and intellectual venues may also complement grassroots political movements by constructing the identities of the historically underrepresented readers who resist oppressive sources of power that have reduced them to a less equal status  in part book selection often opens the established commercial literary canon to legitimize lgbt womens and ethnic voices in fact as june dwyer argues book clubs transcend selected authors and texts to focus on book club participants and discussion in this way defining part of the postmodern movement where accepted authority has been undermined and voices from the margins have gained authenticity  p  reminiscing about a gay mens book discussion group that he once frequented ed cohen reveals his own ambivalence toward identity legitimation one reading group participant recently characterized his feeling about gay bars in the sthat gay and lesbian studies was a place where we didnt have to explain to anyone who we are however my visceral response belies this characterization the more often i find myself at these collocations the more often the nausea in my stomach seems to tell me that i have no idea who we are  p  if grassroots democracy tends toward designing political processes from the lowest level of organization cohens anxious discovery clarifies that these gatherings contribute to the multiple political debates over identity formation by considering dwyers postmodern reading spaces and cohens collective identity crisis this study addresses the reluctance of five gay mens book discussion groups throughout wisconsin to utilize the institutionalized setting of the public library as a venue for debating over and constructing a gay identity via their reading selections according to the mission statements of the states public libraries these institutions seek to provide open access to cultural and intellectual resources that meet the changing informational needs of a diverse population for example on a local level the portage county public library in central wisconsin provides equal opportunity access to information high quality materials programs and online resources to meet the needs of our diverse community for lifelong learning cultural enrichment and intellectual stimulation  on a broader level the eastern shores library system which includes thirteen member libraries seeks to improve and extend public library service to all residents of the library system  however according to statewide book discussion groups catering to the gay male populationarguably one of the diverse populations addressed by these mission statementspublic libraries must work more diligently to provide access to the appropriate resources for these patrons as it stands the gay community and public libraries seem to uphold a rather tense relationship whereas librarians admittedly would like to accommodate them gay male patrons reinforce the conclusions of many ethnographic studies detailed below as they interpret the librarys role as unsympathetic to their social movements in fact many find public libraries as cultural institutions complicit with overlooking homosexual histories cultures and reading habits hence the need for community dialogue as gay book club member michael confessed in my fortyodd years in madison ive never seen a library display books by gay authors in observance of gay and lesbian pride month i mean when has a public library ever marched in a gay pride parade as our ally methodology and participants such articulation of political movements and identity construction inspired this investigation into how wisconsins gay male book discussion groups perceive the social cultural and economic spheres inhabited by themselves and others and how this perception affects their relationships with public libraries as an english professor in the university of wisconsin system president of the friends board of trustees at hedberg public library in janesville wisconsin and volunteer at outreach incmadisons lgbt centeri chose to focus on the states public sectors that i directly affect and that affect me and those i seek to benefit many of the  member public libraries in the eight public library systems throughout wisconsin enjoy providing meeting space to book discussion groups but the genderspecific groups focus specifically on women readers and texts for example the city of muskego public library in the southeast hosts the womens view book discussion group and the neenah public library in east central wisconsin hosts the girlfriends read book club and the girlfriends read teen edition which feature books with strong female characters by women authors however no book discussion groups for the gay male population that is discussions for the community and its allies and centering on gay themes as defined by the group members meet at any of the states public libraries furthermore scholarship on book discussion groups and on relationships with public libraries gives prominence to women in general and lesbian readers thus opening a space for the perspectives of gay men as well studies of several hundred womens book clubs reveal that middleclass welleducated employed women over age forty dominate these gatherings in a stimulating search for knowledge the creation of social bonds and a yearning for fervent discussion in other words these women find occasional refuge from their quotidian obligations of marriage family and career to investigate their interests differences and political allegiances via metaphorical progression through both fictional and nonfictional terrain in this context women who belong to book discussion groups collectively interpret their selections via processes of creating meaning simultaneously informed by and informing both public and private spaces including the book club community itself  i received ninetyfour responses  percent to a threequestion survey distributed to  wisconsin public library directors via surveymonkeycom regarding interest in organizing gay book discussion groups in their outreach efforts see app a of the ninetyfour eighty came from libraries in small cities towns and villages with populations under  with directors who acknowledge the budgetary and political difficulties that would complicate such a project first for budgetary reasons we do have some lgbt titles but in a collection of less than  books total we dont have the ability to provide a large number of titles in any category beyond the very general ones and right now we do not host any book discussion groups in our town of  its been difficult to keep any discussion going second based on circulation records i have regularly purchased a variety of books with the lgbt population in mind and the number of checkouts after six months on the new shelf is always very small  and there is obviously no way to tell if the users were or were not gay in order to use those statistics as a gauge third and most prevalent stands the problem of geography and political alliances of the local patrons in one instance our library would certainly not be opposed to hosting a lgbt book group but given our population and our location im thinking there might not be much of a demand for it more disturbing though is the prediction that as a librarian in a fairly conservative community i would have to consider that a lgbt book group may lead to the loss of some patrons and may or may not attract others in defense of these libraries each of the ninetyfour surveys included a welcoming version of the following statement if we were approached to host an lgbt book discussion we would accommodate their request by providing public meeting space and placing books on hold for members these are services we provide for other book clubs in the meantime gay men and the broader lgbt community seek out literacy enhancement in what they perceive to be more welcoming environments both electronic and brickandmortar  additional seminal work on lesbian library patrons conducted by janet a e creelman and roma m harris and others systematically investigates the information needs and expectations of this population which seeks more updated collections broader genres and more accommodating subject indexing  at the same time through the lens of michel de certeaus theory of the practiced place of space paulette rothbauer challenges the heterosexist concept of the public library as metaphorical closet and banal storehouse of books while citing studies of anxious lesbian patrons clandestinely browsing the stacks for and reading materials on sexual orientations while stifled in dark corners rothbauer argues that the social power embedded in the act of reading these print and electronic texts within public library walls contributes to the creation of a safe community space  literacy fundamental of course to identity culture and survival allows readers and writers of all abilities to challenge and reinforce power dynamics both inside and beyond traditional and nontraditional learning environments subscription databases such as teen health and wellness sirs knowledge source and opposing viewpoints resource center acquaint wisconsins library patrons with current debates definitions opinions scientific research and commentaries of interest to those seeking information about what it means to declare ones sexual orientation or identity however these studies on the librarys role in identity construction focus primarily on the lone patron while steven joyce and alvin schraders empirical study of the needs of gay men from the edmonton public library provides interesting data pursuant to this population  my qualitative study of gay male book discussion groups carefully examines the complex questions that can be difficult or impossible through quantitative methodologies i began my search for these groups with the lavender salon reader the online forum for gay and lesbian reading clubs because the last site update occurred on october   much of the information was outdated however through this database i successfully contacted the owner of outwords bookstore in milwaukee who refused to allow me to interview his mens book club because of concern that the participants might move their discussions to the public library and borrow rather than purchase their selections in june  i turned to outreach inc which through a series of email and telephone channels led me to five gay mens book groups who meet in various locations other than public libraries in madison milwaukee green bay and kenosha i mailed photocopies of the outline of my study and approval from the university of wisconsin colleges institutional review board to each contact person who distributed the documents among the book club participants in each city by the end of august  i had been invited to interview the members during their scheduled gatherings between september and december  about the rationales behind holding all discussions in homes or in openly gayfriendly environments rather than in public libraries and about their perceptions of public libraries because the participants were hesitant about documentation via digital camcorder i recorded only audio group conversations and individual interviews with the thirtyseven participants and kept copious field notes finally i analyzed the data through processes of open and selective coding through the lens of grounded theorya qualitative research method designed to gather a thorough and detailed understanding of human behavior from small focused samples  the discussion begins with an introduction to the library systems group members and their recent reading selections all names are pseudonymous and unless

activist for more than twenty years eddie discovered the book through the list of lambda literary award winners and revealed that i was living in san francisco in  when dan white shot harvey milk and lets say that the injustice and need for community involvement just stuck with me isaac also in his fifties appreciated the selection because a lot of young people think that gay liberation started after stonewall so i i dont know i want to give credit to earlier movements bruce enjoyed the selection because i like to keep my mind sharp but prefers lighter reading because i sit in a cubicle all day and wear a tie and answer a phone and look at a computer so i need some down time and its good to get away from those serious straight people for that reason he asked the group to read george

winecoff addresses the actors sexuality in the age of joseph mccarthy an era preceding the births of the book club members but distressingly relevant to the contemporary united states for me the book was about more than just perkins reveals calvin also an old hollywood aficionado and volunteer at the milwaukee lgbt community center we can still be discriminated against for being gay in too many

how gay people in marketing see us since straight people have been trying to figure that out for years greg a middle manager for a vilified corporation agreed that the selection helped him better

and jack if it was senior citizens night its a completely different culture each decade adds connor an alcohol and drug treatment counselor the book didnt insult me so much but it helped me realize that youth culture isnt the only gay culture and i dont want to hang out with young guys they can be nice to look at until they start thinking and speaking adds jose who asked the group to read michael thomas fords my big fat queer life  two months earlier i got my copy at a signing he did in new york a few years agothe guys got it this yearning for comedy inspired jake to request david sedariss book of essays when you are engulfed in flames  following the ford and frank to return to the essay form with edmund whites the burning library  after the bout with midlife crises according to arthur an auto mechanic who admittedly reads only because it gives him and frank time away from television the condensed form of an essay appeals to his short attention span especially when it reflects on the amusing idiosyncrasies of gay life rather than on serious contemplation the politics of gender and reading group dynamics according to the interviews and conversations the link between public library space and book discussion groups in their collaborative roles of building community developing individual and collective identities and expanding literacy remain ambiguous paul keith general collections and technology librarian reveals the important connection between book club meetings and community relations at the gerberhart like groups sponsored by book stores the whole point of having the groups is to bring people into our space in the past people have looked on gerberhart as a safe space where people can explore their sexual orientation and we were often contrasted with public libraries which were not seen thus however i do not think that this comparison still holds up the gay book discussion groups i interviewed however disagree with keith which opens a window into a healthy debate the clubs themselves appear definable as safe spaces for the community to gather exchange ideas and construct queer identities however the problem stems from their perception that public libraries as much as other public institutions signify homophobia and heterosexism   personal email from paul keith regarding book discussion groups april   exclusive spaces for gay men the five groups themselves and their reading selections revealed telling absences of women members and authors i love my lesbian sisters and i support all of their causes since many of them are ours chimes in jack but this club is for gay men to talk to other gay men about topics of interest to gay men like the womens groups detailed in the literature the men in their own book clubs agree that participation aligns with identity formationas jack arguesand with political interest and action the acrimonious relationship with conservative factions the movements predating the stonewall uprisings nostalgia for a time before aids the cult of gay celebrity and so on such an articulation of political identity suggests that the reading material proposes general group identities providing room for individualistic response through autonomous reading however the discussions serve a more important purpose for these readers first they act as a means of acquiring cultural capital for whitecollar professionals such as josh derek and greg for educators such as philip wes and michael and for volunteers such as devin roger and jason second these men interact daily with the dominant capitalist heterosexual american culture but choose to seek solace by secluding themselves with other gay men on a social and intellectual level of course the need for solidarity among peers is understandable book discussions foster friendships support systems socializing and mutual respect  sociologist peter nardi carries the ramifications of friendship into a larger political and cultural public sphere for new social movements to become mobilized and continue personal networks of communication mass media and high interpersonal interaction density among members of a value community must play central roles  p  the men in this study also argue that the prevalence of gynocentric spaces inspired their own segregation according to dustin from green bay sometimes its nice to be away from my women friends because i have more in common with these guys owen from milwaukee concurs but with misogynist overtones i hate it when women talk about their bodies and that nonsense they wouldnt want us talking about penises if it came up during one of our discussions so well call it a courtesy such separatism persists as a significantly active and vocal element within many facets of lgbt communities and can certainly extend to misandry misogyny andeven within queer culturebiphobia and transphobia owens statement suggests that particularly he but also the other men who prefer to meet only with other gay men perceive the inclusion of other sexes and genders as a formidable challenge to both their personal identities and movement politics travis for example agrees with owen on a more political level i respect the lesbian communitys concerns about the place of women in society and the obstacles they face but men have different obstacles  like people thinking were promiscuous recruiters pedophiles and all that thats why we read books about subjects of interest just to gay men owens particular hostility toward women appears to define this culture of gay readers and to influence the relegated social and discursive gay spaces from madison to green bay both determining and determined by the reading selections the readers refrain from negating or erasing the political concerns of the lesbian community but the refusal to include them in discussions and selections appears to serve as an index of the political threat that lesbians and other queer communities pose to gay male identity and culture while each group demands legitimation they push one another aside topical interest and competition from alternative cultural venues the reading club members relationships with libraries reveal an additional separation between their activism and the broader community of the thirtyseven members present for interviews none would prefer extending the meetings to a public library although most of them receive mailings about library events support programming and occasionally contribute financially to foundations none visits more often than twice per year according to roger who voices the sentiment the majority of programs target children families and senior citizens and none of that concerns me rogers local brown county public library web site reveals his accuracy with links to childrens programs and events the teenzone an evening book group that discusses the traditional great books and another that broadens the canon but meets at  am on the second thursday of each month when the men are working competition from cultural venues also determines visits to public libraries according to isaac theres already more than i can attend on campus indeed the university of wisconsinmadison is rich with athletics exhibits lectures performances workshops and an active lgbt campus center hosting speakers and sponsoring a variety of activities when isaac and i perused through the madison public librarys web site to see what might interest him we discovered many compelling wellness and financial workshops we also found an extensive list of titles and kits for book club discussions at branch libraries but to isaacs dismay many focused on race and ethnicity but none on sexual orientation eg diane ackermans the zookeepers wife chimamanda ngozi adichies half of a yellow sun and amy blooms away furthermore as isaac noticed madison public librarys list of ongoing programs and partnerships listed american indian heritage month and a former observation of african american history month but no events to commemorate gay and lesbian pride month travis and i made a similar discovery on the milwaukee public library web site with a searchable library calendar the terms gay lesbian lgbt and glbt revealed no hits from a possible  events numbers of titles available book selection at the libraries however proved unproblematic after reviewing the catalogs of each public library system with its geographically corresponding book club many of the members did applaud the number of gay titles but not the numbers of each title shown in parentheses for their book club discussions south central library system  searss behind the mask of the mattachine   baxts a queer kind of death   katzs the invention of heterosexuality   moores tweaked   savinwilliamss the new

flames   fords my big fat queer life   koodens golden men   whites the burning library  furthermore when gerald tim wes isaac and i discovered this dearth of their chosen titles in the south central library system we found that the madison public library distributes book discussion kits with multiple copies of the same book with discussion questions and author information after contemplating the absence of gay titles on these extensive lists tim vocally observed a perceived lack of knowledgeable library staff and the librarys willingness to accommodate reading selections i think established groups would want to continue to select books to be discussed rather than relying on a library staff member to create a list from books in their system do you think madison public would order gay books for a gay reading group according to the survey of directors public libraries would accommodate these book clubs with their selections to the best of their abilities but at the core of tims question lies a popular concern about what is at stake if public libraries successfully define what and whose knowledge is of most worth to the larger community marginalizing particular discourses while valorizing others perpetuates the cultural dualisms of which public libraries profess to disapprove in their mission statements proclaiming inclusivity safety in numbers and in private a more urgent discussion emerges because of an absence of safety discretion and shelter at public libraries personal amenities provided instead by private homes and gayfriendly businesses the group from madison once considered holding discussions at a bar or restaurant but according to stephen the main reason we decided against that would also apply to meeting at a library bookstore or any other public place some of us are still partially in the closet and the lack of confidentiality might be a little unsettling furthermore according to philip madisons reputation for being openly gay does not apply to several public institutions including the public library the significance of the public library to many of these men contributes to an intuited separation between city and county services and local gay populations as a cultural institution the public library has constructed channels of social interaction and created a discursive space encouraging conversation and debate  but in the collective gay memory cultural and political institutions primarily deny inclusive rights as best expressed by frank from kenosha everything from local to the federal government bans gay marriage underfunds aids research challenges gay adoption and prevents us from visiting our partners in the hospital i use government resources and public utilities because i have to but ill never go out of my way to support them essential here are the communicative and institutional frameworks contributing to the creation of institutions such as museums historical societies and libraries these institutions attempt to capture and celebrate the solidarity defining an authentic local character through collecting preserving arranging and exhibiting artifacts in order to structure a branch of culture in the sense of what is materially available and of the individuals who respond to the invitation to create and fund these projects quite often the quest for an explanatory authentic past generates a conservative institutional framework laden with ideology and attempting to capture and memorialize the communitys common heritage because politics shapes interpretations of memory and heritage as cultural commodities friction often intensifies between their possible sources for the construction of broad cultural myths often determines and is determined by hegemonic perspectives on universal truths and values isolating those of historically underrepresented groups however the attempt to provide structure to culture often complements rupture fracture and conflict for cultural institutions occasionally stage opposing and multiple debates and developments both legitimating and questioning values and ideas in particular spatial and historical contexts  patrons cannot simply read local narratives from library displays for example rather ideas of the community are mediated through the complex interrelationships between exhibition and viewer such as isaacs disillusionment with the madison public librarys observations of american indian heritage month and african american history month without commemorating gay and lesbian pride month while isaac finds the absence homophobic many wisconsin library directors argue that their conservative patrons may resent acknowledging this population and history in such a community display which of course opens further space for discussion perhaps we must follow david carrs advice when we examine cultural institutions we ought to consider their purposes missions and variations their programs espoused advocacies and public dimensions the forms of assistance and access offered by each the ways we have of interacting with others in them and how thoughtful use of cultural institutions can overcome the occasional barriers of elitism and distance that might discourage learners  p xiv approaching their public libraries about meeting space may actually begin to elicit a favorable response and clear paths for future programming indeed part of the burden according to members of the green bay and kenosha groups falls onto the public libraries outreach efforts to taxpayers according to eric who shelved books in a public library while in high school public libraries are public and should represent the broad array of public interests and being public and having the readings on the librarys regular calendar and in display cases raises awareness although vince admittedly abhors paying taxes he agrees with eric the benefit is that gay people pay their taxes like everybody else and the public library is a community space supported by taxpayer money so it should encourage gay community participation the second milwaukee group which meets in a private home broadens the implications by admitting that public libraries might attract more members to the discussion group but the men are comfortable with their current six for the purposes of manageable discussion however as jeffrey suggests i think meeting in a public library would lend authenticity to our purpose a sentiment supported by josh who adds that it might help build a connection between the gay community and city if we could pull fringe citizens into the larger community to make them feel welcome and valued we might even show the city that were allies instead of pariahs joshs suggestion that alliances require dialogues emphasizes the potential for transformative effects between gay groups and city institutions this suggestion also provides a crucial example of how the material and ideological conditions of daily living form and reform social movements and alliances a critical understanding of the senses of all social actorsthe gay community and the policy makersmay enable us to avoid the essentialism and reductionism entering into our work on the nature of enduring struggles over equal rights and legislation and the possibilities and limits of strategic alliances in a time of social and political conflicts conclusion and application pursuing dialogues as the work in lgbt library service has long proven public libraries must continue improving in areas such as the archiving and cataloging of lgbt texts and overcoming heteronormative employee relations  at the same time as noted above public library directors must tangle with operating budgets and the political philosophies of the communities they serve hence again the need for dialogue by understanding the expectations of gay book discussion groups public libraries may increase the diversity of their patrons and reinforce the philosophy that the library is a welcoming space open to all individuals in the community in fact work published by the american library association encourages library staff to continue working diligently to link to community cultures even those deemed hidden or nonexistent  likewise by understanding the concerns of public library directors gay men and the broader lgbt community have the potential to help these institutions diversify patrons collections and services indeed although recent opinion polls refreshingly suggest that most people oppose removing gaythemed books from public libraries  culture wars will continue between groups who arguably hold widely differing moral visions and ethics of justice and see one another as a menace to american society  furthermore as we know longterm change happens slowly and in small increments public libraries have the ability to support various underrepresented communities by utilizing their role as a focal point of the city as a physical site of information gathering and dissemination furthermore max kirschs concept of the partculture appropriately defines the need for gay mens book discussion groups to meet in the settings of established cultural institutions for the benefit of their own and the broader community partcultures comprise those norms and behaviors that are specific to groupings that hold beliefs and practices significantly differing from the ideology of the dominant culture they form communities and direct energy to further their own ends energy that is all the more effective because of
