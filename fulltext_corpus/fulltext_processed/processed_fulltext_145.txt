multi cultural graduate library education jane robbins carter in the united states almost everyone knows that a librarian is a middle aged white woman two times out of ten she will be a man and once every  or  times she will be other than white but chances are she is white few other occupations are more middle aged more female andor more white the major purpose of this paper is to discover to what extent during the past eight to ten years the student bodies of accredited library school programs have changed from the predominately white demographic characteristic it principal focus is upon the activities and problems involved in higher education for us minority students but it also briefly discusses concerns specifically related to canadian library schools and the education of foreign students in american library schools what is discovered is on the one hand heartening for a number of schools have undertaken effective recruitment programs and there are now more non white librarians for example in  there were only  black students and  svudents of spanish heritage enrolled in accredited programs while in  there were  black and  spanish heritage graduates of these schools on the other hand there is cause for despair because for the most part the progress has been the result of one time efforts supported by dollars from outside of the library schools regular budgets there is in fait little indication that racial diversity is indeed a priority in graduate library education with the myriad of other problems facing the schools problems such as altering curricula providing continuing education programs encouraging faculty to do research to name but a few and considering that it is truly an herculean task to recruit and finance students other than those who select themselves it is not at all surprising that student bodies remain predominatly white carter is associate professor graduate school of library science louisiana state university baton rouge la  
journal of education for librarianship although understandable the bottom line still amounts to institutional racism during the summer of  at an american library association preconference on the recruitment of minorities into the profession much of the conversation naturally centered on library education what was said then is still valid library schools should be charged with the responsibility of changing the racial and ethnic mix of their student bodies to be more representative of the population which their graduates serve what this profession needs is commitment to the recruitment of minorities until we have this commitment backed up by money we only play the game of institutional racism the money is shrinking and what commitment there was in the early  is waning the crisis is still with us now rather more acute than it was then minority education in the us as context it is important for library educators to become familiar with the history of minority education in general and more specifically with postsecondary undergraduate education because of the requirement for master of library science degree candidates to hold the baccalaureate degree further it is useful to be conversant with the experience of other graduate programs especially professional ones with regard to minority participation to that end the following information is presented since its earliest beginnings the american public school system has been deeply committed to the maintenance of racial and ethnic barriers higher education both public and private shared this outlook so states meyer weinberg director of the center for equal education northwestern university and professor of history city colleges of chicago in his  book on the history of the educational experience of black mexican american native american and puerto rican children in the united states even the most noted defenders of public education in america john dewey and horace mann remained silent on the subject of minority participation in public schools the pattern of discrimination against minorities was national and is reflected clearly not just by circumstance and neglect but by statutory exclusion andor statutory separateness the exclusionary pattern was developed for elementary and secondary education in the north and its transfer to the south was facilitated in part by the development of the national education association there is really no room for argument the evidence is abundant and clear there is prodigious writing and discussion about why and how such blatant discrimination can develop in a society which claims to value equality of opportunity this great mass of writing unfortunately has become a base of evidence for explaining away its reality although web dubois and c g woodson graduated from harvard harvard never invited dubois to deliver a

journal of education for librarianship problems encountered when attempting to change professionalism librarianship is an occupation built on the base of education the mls is a credentialing procedure which is accepted because it is assumed that the procedure assures a better professional that those who successfully go through the necessary steps to gain the credential are better suited for the occupation than those who do not despite a lack of evidence to support the assumption we proceed as though it were irrefutably true one reason we adhere to the mls is that we desperately want to believe that librarianship is rational scientific and professional we assume that the mls is the optimal route and shift our concerns to determining how best to choose the people who can make it through the credentialing procedure presuming that we know enough to identify who has the ability and the potential to succeed in the occupation of librarianship we place our confidence in testing educational achievement objective measures such as the gpa and the gre remove irrationality in favor of objective rules and help us to avoid the exercise of judgment because of the difficulty of measuring the effectiveness of our output we continue to accept our historically exercised input measures and further because the profession is so relentlessly concerned with its image it uses high educational standards to bolster whatever little prestige it can muster it becomes increasingly important that members of the profession are able to put on a good front for the public so we count on higher education to exclude those who are not readily observable as highly educated to help us win respect thus we find ourselves back in the elitist educational system shifting the cause for the lack of minorities in the profession away from our own inability to question our credentialing procedure one means of diversifying the racial class and ethnic character of librarianship is to accredit the bachelor degree in librarianship in a delphi study of libraryinformation science education initiated in march  by the university of michigan in cooperation with aals the probability of such an action by  was considered highly improbable furthermore the responses suggested that emphasis on excellent academic records of applicants was both highly probable and highly desirable in addition respondents who indicated the desirability of lengthening the master degree program slightly outnumbered those who were opposed all of the above findings of the michigan study put new mortar in the exclusionary foundation of librarianship an occupation which lacks an attractive image to the majority culture is understandably reluctant to welcome as members minority groups which though on the one hand are proclaimed as having equal access to the privileged educational system are on the other hand widely though quietly known to be discriminated against by it it is possible to accept the exceptional member of a class or race into the profession but surely not possible to encourage parity that would obviously cloud further the already murky image it is only those who see the value of librarianship for all classes in

multi cultural graduate library education order to make more certain that racial factors do not militate against an applicant or on his behalf whether or not the us supreme court will rule on the substantive issues in the bakke case during  is uncertain therefore implementation of special programs for minority students will continue to be inhibited however they need not be precluded it should be the belief that minority participation in graduate education ought to be promoted because our society will be strengthened when the talents of the minority population are more fully utilized therefore it is important to press on during this period of legal ambiguity while it is difficult to design programs which on the one hand are intended to encourage minority participation and on the other hand avoid the use of racial criteria it is possible to develop such programs curriculum content it is easier though demonstrably difficult to alter the nature of professional library education by recruiting into the profession persons of diverse racial ethnic andor experiential background than by changing the curriculum however without changes in the curriculum the educational program will hold little appeal to the different recruits just as foreign students complain that foreign language titles are notably absent from us bibliography courses so also minority group students complain that titles relevant to minority group concerns are ignored a large number of federally sponsored institutes have been held to try to provide both librarians and library school faculty with the information and sensitivity necessary to alter curriculum content the impact of these institutes has been equivocal perhaps the most effective curriculum addition can be found in the area of intercultural communications institutes such as those directed by david cohen at queens college of the city university of new york and by w b lukenbill at the university of texas at austin provide much useful information and many workable suggestions all library schools should continuously evaluate their curriculum from a number of directions one of these should be the relevance of the curriculum to the changing constituencies which today librarian encounters course content emphasizing intercultural communications is essential in today librarianship curriculum it can help sensitize the predominately white middle class student body to the perceptions of minority groups to the profession of librarianship such course content is especially useful when ethnic students such as italian or polish interact with minority group students it is important that differences between race based discrimination and cultural or economic based stereotyping be confronted in the academic setting the purpose of integrating such course content into the librarianship curriculum is not to forward a particular view of what us society ought to be but is rather to equip students with the skills in communication which they will find necessary as members of a servicebased profession 
journal of education for librarianship continuing education a final problem which faces graduate library education in relation to altering its student body is the growing concern with continuing education just as the concern with the legal ambiguity surrounding affirmative action programs is inhibiting the development of and commitment to minority recruitment programs so the shifting of concern to continuing education may become an inhibiting factor there is no argument that many of today library practitioners need access to courses which will increase their effectiveness but the primary responsibility of graduate library education is to provide the profession with new librarians who are able to fill the positions which continue to be needed community outreach and minority librarians are in demand so long as the demand for these types of librarians remains high students who wish to pursue these types of librarianship should be recruited and trained in accredited library school programs in the past and continuing into the present some of the most successful programs for training minority and community outreach librarians have been unaccredited eg california state university fullerton and the university of toledo in preparing this paper information was solicited from schools which are members of the association of american library schools the response rate was slightly less than  per cent this fact alone could be used as evidence to indicate that the response of library schools to the need for minority librarians and the willingness to educate foreign students has been at best half hearted as josey a tireless and eloquent spokesman for minority librarians states it the history of non whites in america has been essentially that of a struggle for survival in a hostile society against a racist white culture the brutal chronicle of attempted extermination slavery segregation and discrimination is well documented in myriad sources throughout the country in spite of this wealth of information on the plight of nonwhites including the vast outpourings of the last decade by the victims themselves little change has taken place in their condition in american society minorities still suffer from the crippling disease of racism and its malignant attendant discrimination one of the areas where this is distressingly evident continues to be the job market the failure to provide equal job opportunities for minorities is the chief cause of their low position in the economic system although the library profession has paid lip service to the recruitment of minorities there has been no real commitment what is sought is accredited library school programs which  reject prediction of educational achievement based on racial or ethnic identity economic status or sex  assure that differences between the minority makeup of the school and the community from which the school predominately draws its student body is a result of choice and not of injustice and  develop a self sustaining process wherein minority participation is the accepted norm rather than the result of special effort it is fervently hoped that those of you who have read this paper will turn now to vigorously pursue a program which will meet the conditions listed above and will encourage the aals to initiate a scholarship program it is time for library education to seek out and celebrate diversity among practitioners
