introduction storytime programs for young children are ritual events in the everyday life of the public library although storytimes serve diverse purposes for the library as well as for the families who attend them professional literature for librarians tends to focus only on the ways that storytime supports early childhood literacy  and highlights the work of the program leader  in this article we take a somewhat different approach to argue that storytime is not only the product of work carried out by librarians but also of work carried out by adult and child participants and indeed by other social actors who may be unknown to members of the local setting but whose work in other settings affects the education and development of young children and the work of the adults who care for them as do researchers working in the ethnomethodological tradition   we define work broadly to include anything people do that contributes to the accomplishment of the social order of a setting wayne wiegand observed that constrained definitions of information learning and education have inevitably led the lis community to think primarily about the user in the life of the library  p  we likewise argue that constrained definitions of work in organizations such as public libraries render important activities invisible and taken for granted even to those who do the work this article draws on data gathered for an ongoing observational study of early learning programs for very young children and their adult caregivers our study identifies and analyzes work that enables storytime to take place including for example the social networking of parents and caregivers at storytime the article builds on studies of the public library as a physical space   and of the library in the life of the user  by describing the often invisible work that goes into accomplishing social settings within the physical space of the library moreover it complements largescale longitudinal studies that track indicators of childrens wellbeing and evaluative studies that map community assets or assess program effectiveness by illuminating the social processes through which the goals of storytime are realized we contend that at storytime many kinds of work including literacy work and information work are integrally linked and sometimes conjoined with other kinds of work especially caring work several researchers have demonstrated the relationship between information work and caring work particularly those kinds of caring work more often than not carried out by women in the home marjorie devault  p  found that the work involved in sustaining mealtime conversation has typically been regarded as trivial as one of the unremarkable ways that women pass time when they get together she argued that in fact new ideas are important for each womans work and their talk provides one of the ways that they can learn about the essentially private household practices of their peers  p  pamela mckenzie  found that pregnant womens accounts of seeking information provided important evidence that they were becoming appropriately prepared for motherhood rebecca tardy  p  suggested that the mundane conversations occurring when mothers and children gather together serve to construct the womens identities particularly as mothers she emphasized that the actual talk independent of any outcomes was part of the evidence of the caring work of good motherhood literacy work too is often carried out in conjunction with caring work rosamund stooke  investigated the intersections between literacy work and caring work and reported that childrens librarians identified relationship building with families as a necessary component of the work they carry out on behalf of young childrens literacy as one librarian responded to stookes question what do you do that supports young childrens literacy the value of taking five minutes and not even doing the reference work just saying to them how are you today and are you in school or speaking to the mother youve made a connection and then theres a bit of trust that seems to develop im just noticing because ive only been at this library for a few months and people are now starting to come up to me and say could you recommend something and you had to earn their trust before they were willing to bring big questions  because even if youd had the formal training the opportunity to make use of it wouldnt have presented itself  you know it just wouldnt have worked it took them coming to me and then i could use that formal knowledge but i had to build the relationship first  p  our analysis is framed by a collectivist perspective which understands both public library use and information needs seeking and use to be a part of or embedded in a cultural social or organisational practice  p   we work from the premise that storytimes come into being against a backdrop of staffing schedules room bookings fire regulations and the like the very existence of storytime therefore depends on decisions made earlier and elsewhere we further propose that as program participants interact socially over a period of several sessions their interactional work serves to construct each program as a complex communicative space and at the same time to construct its participants as an emerging discourse community indeed we contend that this process has begun before participants arrive at the first program session participants may not have met one another prior to attending a program but their voluntary attendance references specific ways of coordinating words thoughts deeds values bodies objects tools and technologies and other people at appropriate times and places so as to enact and recognize specific socially situated identities and activities  p  that identify them as members of a discourse community for example they may share assumptions about the role storytime plays in the construction of family life  or they may share the need to be the right sort of parent who gets the child ready for school and all that implies for the child as a future wage earner  collectivist approaches question the validity of universalistic models and argue against studying users in general  p  and therefore move away from the perspective of an individual user within a context a monologic actor affected by environmental variables  p  instead the focus of analysis in collectivism is the group rather than the individual and attention during the research process is focused externally onto the characteristics of the environment  p  we accordingly attend to the arrangement of the physical space and the form and tempo of the activities carried out in the space before during and after the formal programs we aim to accomplish two tasks first we provide an account of the kinds of work carried out to produce a public library storytime program second we demonstrate ways in which information work and literacy work are conjoined with or embedded in other kinds of work including seemingly inconsequential activities such as discussions about childrens clothing by so doing we aim to contribute to critical conversations about everyday life information seeking  and to illuminate takenforgranted aspects of the work of childrens librarians  and adult and child library users methods our data were collected as part of a naturalistic investigation of early learning programs for very young children and their caregivers three members of the research team observed storytime programs targeting young children birth to thirtysix months hosted by two neighborhood branches mariposa and st stephens green of the public library system of a canadian city of over  people the city where we collected data is typical of central canadian cities its demographics attest to the preponderance of british among its first european settlers and to later emigration from elsewhere in europe and more recently from asia africa and the middle east the library branches were both located in residential neighborhoods and were selected for the different demographic characteristics of those neighborhoods st stephens green library is a freestanding building located in an established and affluent neighborhood within walking distance of downtown the neighborhoods residents are more educated and more likely to speak english as a first language than residents of the city as a whole  mariposa is a somewhat newer suburban neighborhood where a number of recent immigrants have settled its average income education level and proportion of native english speakers are lower than those of st stephens green and it has a higher visible minority population its library shares a building with a neighborhood community center in both locations between eight and sixteen babies and toddlers attended each of the storytime programs with their caregivers each week two caregivers were grandmothers one a paid babysitter one a father and the rest mothers older children sometimes accompanied caregivers and young children both programs were led by a professional childrens librarian the research team observed two complete sequences of storytime sessions one in each branch for a total of eleven thirtyminute storytimes the team employed three data collection methods first program sessions were observed and audio recorded during each storytime two or three observers stood or sat in various parts of the room as unobtrusively as possible and made field notes second members of the team observed and talked informally with participants before and after storytime and recorded these data in field notes finally the team conducted semistructured individual and focus group interviews with adult caregivers of children attending storytime interviews were semistructured and questions were developed following the field observation  interview guides contained questions such as why do you come to this program what other things do you do with your children is this program different fromsimilar to other things you do how all audiotapes were fully transcribed the study conforms to the ethical guidelines of the social sciences and humanities research council of canada and the nonmedical research ethics board of the university of western ontario and we have used pseudonyms throughout to protect anonymity consistent with the goals of naturalistic inquiry we used several strategies to ensure the trustworthiness of the analysis including prolonged engagement triangulation of researchers sites and methods observation interviews member checking sharing emerging results with a subset of participants and peer debriefing conferring about ongoing analysis with other members of the research team  we specifically chose a naturalistic research paradigm as it will allow us to explore research questions about which little is now known enable us to see and understand the programs through the eyes of the participants themselves   and provide thick rich descriptions of the processes involved  analysis the authors have analyzed the data both thematically in keeping with a grounded theory approach   and relationally to identify links between work carried out by individuals at storytime and work carried out elsewhere  our analysis conceptualizes storytime programs not only as settings in which social life is conducted but as ongoing productions in their own right we do not wish to convey that the programs we observed are unbounded in time or space it is clear that the formal component of each session has a ritual opening and closing that separates it from the informal activities that take place before and after it is also clear that the program is created within limits conferred by the characteristics of the program room and by organizational restraints such as staffing schedules and room availability as in any stage production the performance of the actors temporarily transforms the production space our analysis therefore first addresses aspects of preproduction work and then identifies some ways that program participants like actors on a stage construct and rearrange the space to facilitate certain kinds of activity and constrain other kinds planning a library program for young children embeds administrative work for librarians  librarians must first schedule the programs and publicize them for potential participants they must also decide whether or not to limit attendance to registered participants at mariposa and st stephens green libraries participants are required to register one week prior to the first session although attendance is free of charge and nominally open to all at both locations the high demand for places in a program makes storytime a scarce resource unlike programs for families deemed at risk where repeat attendance is encouraged the programs we observed were planned to end after five or six sessions and in subsequent programs first timers were accommodated before returning families some caregivers traveled across the city to circumvent this problem one caregiver joked that you can almost do them one right after another if you are willing to drive to other locations but even first timers sometimes needed to deploy whatever economic social and cultural capital   they had at their disposal in order to participate they described registering their friends children along with their own and they noted that they relied on one another for information rather than on the librarys promotional flyer mother we also knew that you had to sign up first thing and friend was busy so i signed up for both the kids you know cause i know somebody who phoned up at  after the signup period began at  am and they couldnt get in focus group transcript st stephens green mother the brochure just told me what time to register and when the sessions would be but the mothers are they give you the true scoop laughs of whats good and whats bad what to avoid what to seek out more of its gotta come from you gotta get your story from real people followup interview transcript st stephens green having surmounted the obstacles presented by the registration process caregivers routinely sandwich their attendance at library programs into busy schedules that include innumerable other activities not only adults paid work but also other educational and recreational activities for the children mother ok monday swimming tuesday swimming wednesday library thursday kindermusik and sometimes swimming in the afternoon and friday i go to a playgroup at commercial playspace with other mothers with similar backgrounds um and sometimes swimming again in the afternoon followup interview transcript st stephens green two mothers are chatting mother  guess what we saw yesterday in the wagon we went to intersection and saw a whole lot of tractors theyre widening the road and we stayed and watched for half an hour mariposa library researcher  r field notesweek  two mothers are chatting baby may start day care in november one or two days a week and her mum tells two other mothers how that feels very sad she says that she and her husband are going to talk to the daycare people on tuesday she then begins to talk to other mum about how busy she is these days and says that they just bought an apartment building so were doing all that tenant stuff st stephens green library researcher  r field notesweek  both programs took place in rooms designated by library administrators as multipurpose spaces these rooms were situated apart from each librarys public area they contained storage cabinets stacking chairs and multipurpose foldable tables but were otherwise unfurnished with walls painted in neutral shades and few additional decorations a distinguishing characteristic of both rooms was their bareness and the obvious attention paid to child safety features conditions that afford a librarian an opportunity to create a safe space for very young children and a welcoming one for caregivers in library parlance the work involved in creating a program space within a multipurpose room is known as doing the set up the librarian may not do the physical work of setting up the room but she configures the space in accordance with her vision for the program her configuration of the space serves a semiotic function by conveying to participants where to place themselves and their things as well as how to participate for example both librarians placed a low stool against one wall to sit on and stored all the props and books unobtrusively nearby a large rug or small mats indicated the area where families should sit the librarians did a great deal of work to identify and prepare appropriate materials to support their programs for each storytime session librarians identified a theme related to the lives of very young children their creation evaluation and selection of good books rhymes and other materials therefore allowed them to create a plot for each storytime around that theme and based on understandings of child development appropriate to the ages represented in each individual group a nearby table bore handprepared name tags for each participant pamphlets on library programs extra copies of the books used in the program and other books on the same themes a visit to this table was an almost universal arrival ritual for families child  and mum are talking about name tags child  is wanting child  and his mother who havent yet arrived to have their name tags child  and his mum walk in child  says names of mother and child  child  walks over toward the door and gives name tags to child  and mum child  holds his triumphantly over his head and walks toward his place mariposa r field notesweek  we noted that the childrens librarians had also created program spaces such that an outer area of the room functioned as a cloakroom strollers and clothes could be stored there but children were encouraged to remain in the inner circle formed by the adult bodies of course the ongoing space was created and maintained by children as much as by adults and a safe space from an adults perspective may be seen by a toddler as an invitation to check out the limits of the space and to challenge them toddler has disappeared from the coffee room caregiver urgently careful dont pinch his fingers sprints through the door between the coffee room and the programme room  i notice that fouryearold accompanying toddler and caregiver isnt here any more im guessing that she went into her storytime and toddler headed after her as the door into the storytime room was closing mariposa r field notesweek  librarians were not the only participants who created spaces within larger spaces we observed that some families regularly staked out territory while others changed position from week to week they created family spaces which were hardly noticeable until a fouryearold at mariposa contested the arrangements by placing herself between two mothers rather than beside her own caregiver we also observed that caregivers brought with them an array of domestic supplies and equipment that constructed programs as extensions of domesticity  p  child who is sitting in front of me has discovered her mums purse which was tucked just inside the larger alcove of the wall she is rooting around in it and pulls out a photo of a group of people child crumples it a little in her hands then hands it to her mum green r field notesweek  as storytime began the circle formed by the adult bodies became less easily permeable by children and adults both the song is interrupted by the arrival of two babies and their mums who cut across the circle and sit down in front of me  the arrivals create sufficient disruption that the song trails off and librarian apparently not the least bit thrown off moves subtly and expertly into the next element of her program to recapture the attention of the mothers and babies green r field notesweek  far from being controlled entirely by the librarian the form and tempo of storytime were given an ongoing shape through countless negotiations among participants apart from late arrivals adults breached the circle only when tending to children either moving about to soothe a fussing infant or more commonly moving to retrieve a wayward toddler some elements of storytime are constructed like a performance for which the caregivers and children are the audience librarians read books aloud holding them open toward the children and caregivers seemingly inconsequential details such as how an artifact is presented can make important differences in the way storytime unfolds the mariposa librarian routinely walked around to show each child a page of a book a practice that afforded a great deal of both casual conversation and activity but compromised the librarians ability to control the form and tempo of storytime we had a lengthy discussion with librarian she talked very reflectively about the balance of facilitating conversation without letting parents unrelated talk take over  we talked about the logistics of passing out shakersbells whether to go around and pass or to pass the container to the caregivers and have them pass it aroundthis is a problem because not all caregivers know what to do and the librarian loses control we talked about pacing and the fact that you can control the pacing if you stay in charge of the puppetsbells or whatevers being passed green r field notesweek  at other times all participants are performers both librarians used large stuffed animals to be their baby and demonstrated the rhymes and bounces on them either with or without additional verbal instruction and caregivers responded by repeating the actions with their children librarian wheres your nose all three mothers touch their babies noses librarian ears all three mothers touch their babies ears green r field notesweek  librarians read childrens bodies and gaze as informative of childrens engagement and thereby of the success of their attempts to provide developmentally appropriate programs librarian this is probably my favourite storytime to do and lots of people say what do babies do with books for babies do they pay attention do they inaudible the stories what do they do and i feel like ive got the best place in the room ause im right up at the front like this and i see when they sit on your lap facing us i see their expressions and their eyes and its beautiful green transcriptweek  caregivers work during the formal program served primarily to support the librarians work by ensuring that children could hear the story coordinating childrens gaze was an important practice that contributed to this work by verbally instructing their children and physically moving their bodies caregivers share powerful consensual understandings about how one ought to behave at the zoo such consensus includes the understanding that the animals behind the bars should be the object of focus rather than the bars themselves  at storytime caregivers work both explains and constructs appropriate audience and performer behavior librarian everybody got their baby on their lap in a place where they can see mother of toddler  groans softly mother of toddler  no laughter and general background noise librarian that looks great  and inaudible the circle  general background noise mother of toddler  shes gonna tell us off no she specifically said you have to sit down look at the book look at the book now book green transcriptweek  the physical management of artifacts communicated transitions and indicated appropriate activities for various times and places toddler  had left his spot on the floor beside his mother to stand directly in front of the librarian toddler s attention is attracted by the clear greenlidded plastic container of tickle puppets sitting on top of the storage unit he points to the box saying doo doo mum calls to him name librarian to toddler  i think your mums got one by this time toddler  has arrived in front of librarian and librarian has made the decision to stop the rhyme she was getting ready for she takes down the box opens it and gives each of them a tickle puppet putting the box behind the storage unit green r field notesweek  by removing the puppets to a place inaccessible to the children the librarian signals that it is time to look at the next book caregivers communicated this message to children by physically showing them where they needed to be or moving them there bringing hidden objects into view likewise informed participants of impending transitions the ending of the formal program was marked by ritual activities involving previously hidden objects and spaces passing out cookies opening the door to the room where coffee and cookies would be consumed putting a basket of board books onto the floor librarian okay im going to put down some board books now and ill come around and trade tickle puppets for a cracker if your child can have one ive also got some booklets over on the side table if anyone is interested theyre called books for babies and they talk about the importance of reading to babies theyve got some examples of good books to read for the very ambitious its got patterns for finger puppets in the middle you can bring those next week if you like lots of laughter from adults caregiver ill get right on that librarian and a few parenting resources and things like that so those are there for you to take with you and ill get some brochures for you next week on some of the rhymes that we do in storytime green transcriptweek  the librarians narration of these activities embeds several kinds of work in support of storytime first the librarian simultaneously acknowledges and challenges the authority of the dominant discoursethat mothers job is to support literacy by such activities as reading to babies and producing finger puppets second and related the laughter and ironic response from a mother is indicative of the librarians success at positioning herself in solidarity with the community of caregivers simultaneously however her expert knowledge about the importance of reading to babies and knowing what are good books to read positions her within that discourse as an authoritative information source for caregivers third the librarians selection of materials to share both demonstrates her own information work and affords further information work in describing the crackers the librarian named a common canadian brand with the understanding that this would give the caregivers some information about the cookies then i know that she offered the box in case anyone wanted to read the ingredients green r field notesweek  this small gesture demonstrates that the librarian shared a community understanding ie that caregivers might be concerned with nutritional information and that reading a cracker box is an appropriate activity and provided information sources based on that understanding fourth the librarian chose materials that counted as good books to read indicated the librarys holdings reinforced the content of todays storytime and had been evaluated for their physical condition librarian was setting out the basket of board books and she and researcher  were talking about how she decides about the board books each week does she just put out whatevers in the library on the day of storytime she was telling researcher  that no she picks the ones that relate to the theme of todays storytime and those that are in good shape i asked librarian about the observation i made last week when she put the board book basket down and put the books out on the floor she put one book back onto the table instead of on the floor she said it was because that particular copy wasnt in very good condition and she likes to put nicelooking ones out she lamented that it had even been i went walking the implication was that this was a good and ontopic book that otherwise would have been an excellent addition green r field notesweek  finally it is worth noting that although the librarians work bears traces of an earlier social organization of childrens librarians work captured in dee garrisons phrase genteel library hostess  p  it in no way references the nineteenthcentury childrens librarians proclivity toward moral guardianship as the formal activities end the circle of adult bodies dissolves into looser and more fluid configurations the librarians leave to prepare for other programs but most caregivers stay in the room to chat breastfeed babies read to toddlers or watch them play babies and toddlers need for food and sleep coordinates the adults activities some families leave early for nap time as i come into the coffee room and set my things on the table beside the door infants mum is getting him bundled up to leave hes wailing i say grumpy infants mum hes tired its his nap time infant and mum leave mariposa r field notesweek  while others remain longer in order to breast or bottlefeed or provide a snack both our observations and the tape recorder caught an example mother  and mother  are talking about bananasmother  has just produced one from a bag and is feeding it to her child she says bananas are good because they are sweet and easy to eat the conversation quickly switches to how long it is taking these days to get their babies dressed now that the weather is cooler and more layers are required green r field notesweek  mother  is she eating her banana mother  yeah mother  big old banana mother  yeah we figure theyre sweet and easy for babies to eat green transcriptweek  the room has been transformed by the work of all participants from a sittingandwatching space to a movingandtouching space librarian well have a little time to just chat amongst ourselves and you can have a look at some books that are good for babies and get to meet each other youll notice that the babies names are on the top of your name tags and underneath that is the name of the person whos brought the baby today so it makes it easier to talk to them and get to know them a little bit green transcriptweek  the work undertaken by storytime participants does not end with the formal program it merely changes in form and character but it remains embedded in both the ongoing social accomplishment and the emergent discourse community there is no official set down but caregivers and some children tidy the toys so that the librarian can return and set up the next program from scratch findings our analysis supports the view that the work carried out to produce a library storytime is both discursively bound and value laden for example both librarians and caregivers work to assess and maximize childrens engagement in the stories and rhymes their actions point to a consensual understanding that literacy work is the work here and this takenforgranted valuing of literacy work establishes a hierarchy of appropriate activities at different times during the program and in different parts of the room during formal activities initiated by the librarian children within the inner circle created by the adults and their belongings were encouraged to pay attention to the librarian moreover information sharing among caregivers which is ostensibly work commensurate with the information mandate of public libraries was carried out only in the interstices between librarianinitiated activities it is noteworthy that the librarians did provide parenting and consumer information during formal activities in both settings for example the librarians communicated their sensitivity to caregivers need to know about the ingredients of the snack crackers they offered to the children librarians also alerted caregivers to inexpensive sources of childrens books and finger puppets paradoxically they appeared to be using the authority accorded them through program leadership to minimize the asymmetrical relations of power between themselves and the participants those actions worked to position them as caregivers like everyone else on completing the formal activities the librarians relinquished control of activities to the adult caregivers the librarians in both settings articulated a view that commonalities and connections established among participants through informal talk are valuable outcomes for public library storytime programs commonalities and connections are valuable outcomes in their own right but they are valuable too because they support the librarys efforts to provide literacy opportunities for young children in planning and conducting storytimes both librarians aimed to create spaces for informal conversation among the adults they also visited with participants before and after the formal programs and made sure that the storytime spaces remained available to participantsdespite the many competing demands for their time and the competing demands for the use of the physical space as noted earlier the st stephens green librarian remarked that storytime aims to provide both access to literacy for children and access to parenting networks and information for adults the work of establishing commonalities was distributed among the librarians the caregivers and the children whose appearances and actions provided the impetus for and the topics of much of the conversation among caregivers for example after one session at st stephens green several mothers were engaged in the exchange of birth stories but they adapted their conversation to include another mothers adoption story when it became evident that she did not have a birth story to share the baby whose skin was a different color from her mothers had been adopted from another country a discussion of the babys shoes started a conversation that included the mothers story of how the baby had come to live with her family it is worth noting that the conversation provided an opportunity for mothers to discuss the babys origins without drawing attention to race while simultaneously establishing a very new mothers credentials as one of us mother  i love those shoes mother  we got them in other country actually mother  really mother  oh my god there were so many pairs of shoes ause they were allthese were all leather shoes and they cost  mother  oh my gosh mother  theyre so expensive here so i got some for when shes grown too mother  inaudible shes doing okay though mother  yeah shes doing really well weve been together since two months ago so uh she seems to be attaching to me inaudible baby cries mother  how old was she mother  she was  months mother  right so did it take some time to adjust mother  it was very hard inaudible mother  she looks very happy mother  yeah shes got a great personality green transcriptweek  it is also worth noting that in addition to establishing commonalities among participants the mothers conversation worked to construct a shared understanding of normal child development and to validate this mothers work   the purchase of distinctive shoes for such a good price presented the mother as a savvy shopper capable of broadening the options ordinarily available to her at home however the cost of travel and any costs of the adoption were not factored into the bargain price of the shoes the caregivers talk interpreted and defined the childs clothing for one another enabling a child unable to talk on her own to inform through her appearance as in other settings in which caregivers and young children gather together  participants developed and maintained boundaries that defined the range of topics open and not open for casual conversation whereas literacy work was privileged during the formal part of the program the informal conversation among participants largely covered topics related directly to domestic life and child care eg consumerism homemaking and household hints caring and family life and health it is instructive to consider what was not talked about although mothers shared birth stories we did not hear discussions of postpartum physical and psychological changes although there was much talk about childrens clothing and footwear we did not hear much talk about adults clothing or about the material resources required in order to acquire clothing indeed the tone of the conversation was generally light with few references to the kinds of topics addressed in parenting programs mother  and the other programs are a resource for the parents as far as any discipline problems you are having they have resources like people who know about taking care of children you can ask them about stuff where as this is more like learning from the experiences of other mums mother  theyre ece workers with special credentials in early childhood education that run them r so people who are trained mother  yeah theyre ece workers that run them and they have other people come in like special needs resourcing and things like that or they have hearing clinics and do the testing for threeyearolds and all that stuff mother  yeah and like inaudible baby they have postnatal depression classes and you know things like that green focus group transcript as did the librarians we contend that the literacy work carried out during the storytime program is often conjoined with information work andor caring work and that these are mutually constitutive while harris cautions librarians against confusing activity with purpose  p  we argue that literacy activities afford opportunities for the acquisition of social capital through informal information seeking giving and use  conversely information and caring work carried out by all the adults creates a fertile ground in which caregivers and children can cultivate family literacy practices conducive to childrens future success in school the diverse activities that constitute storytime therefore contribute in many ways to the purposes of the public library and also to family life conclusion we have characterized the public library storytime as a complex communicative space in addition to introducing caregivers to library resources and providing very young children with a printfilled environment a public library storytime affords and embeds many kinds of social activity at first glance much of the work of storytime which is accomplished through the use of talk bodies and artifacts is not visible however a collectivist perspective and a generous definition of work allow us to adjust the scope of our lens in ways that bring previously hidden work into view additionally a collectivist perspective allows us to begin to identify ways in which actions carried out by individuals at a storytime are linked to actions carried out by social actors in other settings the work of ceos and library planners is linked through the creation and use of organizational texts such as building blueprints staffing schedules and strategic plans to the work of frontline professionals and library users moreover the work of administrators and planners is linked through the creation and use of government documents advertising and other media texts to work carried out in government offices and corporations there is evidence too that activities at storytime are organized through the ongoing creation and maintenance of its discursive boundaries it is not as easy to recognize this work or to apprehend its extralocal organization as foucault has argued discourses are practices that systematically form the objects of which they speak  p  they lack the concreteness of texts even digital ones and they eschew critique indeed discourses are powerful for precisely that reason nevertheless we identified events in which discourses that are active in diverse sites appear to be organizing the activities of individuals at a storytime a caregivers efforts to orient a babys gaze toward the librarian for example can be linked to an unstated but widely held expectation that children should arrive at school with the ability to attend to instructions and to listen well nothing may be further from the caregivers mind of course but the action references ideas about early child development and care work that permeate parent advice literature and policy texts such as the organization for economic cooperation and developments starting strong  finally a collectivist perspective and a generous definition of work allow us to catch a glimpse of the complex and sometimes contradictory roles that public libraries play in the lives of users while it is fair to acknowledge the role that storytime plays in preparing children for future success at school it is also worth noting that storytime survives as a ritual event in the life of the public library because it provides a space for spontaneity and joy the st stephens green librarians off the cuff remark about finger puppets serves to remind us first that storytime affords opportunities for participants to contest takenforgranted ideas and turn them on their heads and second that no definition of work should underestimate the value and importance of play
