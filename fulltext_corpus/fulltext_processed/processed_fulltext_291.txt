the udc and fid  a closer and more intensive historical study than is normally given to fid a full scale history is not possible here but fid could be shown as a bibliographic organization gradually and almost involuntarily precipitated from its immediate historical context a european and a more general background would help more precisely to identify and determine the significance of the individual and institutional decisions by which fid was created and developed the ready acceptance in at least the french speaking parts of europe of the hydra headed bibliographic monster would need to take into account the proposals of jullien danjou and van der haeghen the more general background would be in terms of a widespread intense preoccupation in europe as well as in england and america with the idea of universal bibliography near the end of the nineteenth century was added the ideal of international subject bibliography examined not only by internationally oriented learned societies but even by government the general purpose of this paper is to provide an approach to the kind of historical study described above by examining udc in a number of different but historical ways the importance of fid lies in its being the major impetus for the development of a true bibliographic internationalism embodying and explicitly encouraging the development of a new concept of bibliographic organization called documentation udc was developed as a tool of european documentation by otlet and la fontaine and others initially documentation was a rationalization of iib and its work provided a theoretical base for it udc as well as iib or fid needs to be studied in the knowledge of that theory usually udc is considered basically apart from iib but that it could have been structurally affected by this origin is little realized specifically then this article aims to provide a brief exposition of the theory of documentation as developed by otlet and others in relation to iib the rbu and udc it will then consider some of the problems historically presented by udc and provide a new kind of historical perspective for them all of this will reflect back upon fid itself in a greater awareness of the complexities involved in dealing with it and of the nature scope and difficulties presented by the bibliographic problem generally  d j foskett science hutmanism and libraries new york hafner  chap vii  w e a axon danjou scheme of universal bibliography library journal     project for a general catalogue of french libraries library journal    translation of an article in the revue bleu august   over the initials r r l for an account of english attempts at a universal bibliography see w boyd rayward towards a history of systematic bibliography in england   occasional paper no  urbana university of illinois in press  the royal society is the most famous of these but in england the society of arts and the bibliographical society in its formative years cannot be neglected in america as early as  the american association for the advancement of science set up a committee to consider the indexing of the literature of the chemical elements library journal jan   nor should the bodies that produced the engineering index and poole index and the ala index be ignored here  the us signal service prepared an international bibliography of meteorology a bibliography of science library journal   reprinted from science sept   the us patent office had a considerable program of indexing see howard l prince patent office indexing library journal    above all there was the index catalogue of the us surgeon general library billings catalogue a fascicule of which appeared as early as 
 the library quarterly ii in defining the work of iib schneider observes that it desires primarily to serve documentation that is to say to combine organically by means of raphic marks all things that deal with one subject one thought one thing or one impression regardless whether these be books pictures or musical scores this is reminiscent of the opening of one of the first important statements of a theory of documentation by documentation is meant to day the putting to use of all of the written or graphic sources of our knowledge such as are constituted by documents of all kinds especially printed texts these documents comprise all of that which represents or expresses with the help of whatsoever signs writing pictures diagrams symbols an object an event or an impression in this view documentation is considered explicitly as the complement of other methods of investigation observation experimentation and deduction supported by an integrated and timely documentation libraries and collections helped by instruments of research bibliographies exercised according to rational and reflective processes criticism of sources the documentary method permits truely the collaborative assistance of all who have worked previously on the same questions in the early theorizing of otlet many statements appearing in the early publications of iib are unsigned but probably written by him perhaps with collaboration from la fontaine documentation was intimately linked with iib the rbu and udc everything flowing ultimately from or to the repertory this theorizing has two important aspects the one relates to the systematic and worldwide organization of graphic materials irrespective of form through universal co operation for unification of methods and the other relates to a tendency to locate primacy of bibliographical concern in the literatures of science and technology in the first case institutional limitations to bibliographic organization such as are inevitable in libraries and similar focused institutions were to be completely transcended the rbu on the one hand would provide the rallying point for documentary work anywhere and the udc on the other would present a general scientific tool for achievement of the much desired internationalization of methods and general standardization of results in the second case one can only describe a tendency for strictly documentation was to be neither materials nor subject limited rather it was to provide an organized system which would mediate between the public and documents on all matters whether scientific technical historical social or industrial nevertheless and especially the word ocumentation expresses a function such as that which must satisfy scientific and technical writing transformations may occur in the book or modifications may befall the internal arrangement of organizations charged with its conservation and distribution that which is most important that which remains permanently is the necessity for rapid complete up to date  georg schneider theory and history of bibliography trans ralph shaw new york scarecrow press  p   paul otlet la documentation in lrganization systematique de la documentation et le developpement de institut international de bibliographie iib publication  no  pp  
the udc and fid  information    that is the need for documentation one might argue that it was primarily the difficulty of obtaining information from scientific and technical literature that initiated the bibliographic movement of which documentation was part if documentation with its emphasis on real information and only incidentally on bibliographic information could adequately cope with this material it could cope with any otlet though constantly arguing a special theory of documentation in the thirties apparently became convinced of the need for a more generalized theory initially iib was set up very definitely and was heartily applauded for this by francis campbell of the british museum himself a neglected but forward looking student of bibliography as an exclusively scientific association  which was to devote itself to the scientific study of bibliography it is high time wrote campbell for the institution of such an association  confusion of tongues is bad enough but confusion of books is worse for him what most recommended the iib as distinct from the royal society enterprise begun at the same time was its attempt to deal with literature as a whole according to a rationalized and systematic plan on a worldwide basis the science lay in the plan almost forty years after the founding of the exclusively scientific association otlet attempted to transcend the rationalization of the particular that characterized his theorizing to that date he attempted rigorously and logically to elaborate in precise terminology a general theory of documentation that would have an organization and development as close lucid and self sustaining as any mathematical or scientific exposition such a theory considers documentation as a social phenomenon and attempts to set it as firmly as possible in epistemology we need now not only bibliography the description of books but bibliology that is to say a general science and technology of the document the traite and the systematique are extraordinary documents apparently never available in english the nearest approach to their theorizing is that of shera and egan in the various papers culminating in foundations of a theory of bibliography and the introduction to bradford documentation the former makes a plea for a new kind of social epistemology on the continent some attempt was made to continue the conceptual development and refinement of documentation brought to such a high point by otlet most ideas about documentation however subse henri la fontaine and paul otlet ltat actuel de questions bibliographiques et lrganization internationale de ia documentation iib bulletin  p  iib actes officiels statuts article l reprinted in manuel de repertoire bibliograpkique universel brussels  p   f b campbell lnstitut international de bibliographie the library   paul otlet la systematique de la documentation documentatio universalis annexe  p  tlet traite de documentation op cit n  above argaret egan and jesse shera foundations of a theory of bibliography library quarterly april     jesse shera and margaret egan a review of the present state of librarianship and documentation in bradford documentation op cit n  above pp    see for example g a von riemsdijk bibliographie et documentation essai de definition de ces idwes fid communicationes    and robert pages transformations documentaires et milieu cultural essai de documentologie review of documentation

the udc and fid  approach a subject from different points of view different angles if firstly all these approaches are provided for in a number and if classification can occur by the successive recombined elements of that number the auxiliary tables with their signs of association actually fix the order of elements and thereby reduce their capacity for reversal and recombination the difficulty is one arising from a confusion between subject indication on the one hand and a tendency in the classification on the other to encourage document codification the one being limited and hampered by the other this attempt to create a notation for udc that would in otlet phrase express all shades of ideologico bibliographical analysis of a document brings udc in metcalfe mind into the same category as analytico synthetic classifications of which ranganathan colon classification cc is typical and to metcalfe anathema ranganathan himself finds considerable fault with udc essentially because it is not cc while not doing full justice to the historical background of udc he observes that by  when the world congress of universal documentation met in paris dc was still able to negotiate    the specific subjects that got embodied in books and the library profession did not practice documentation work to any great extent but in the field of documentation the faults of the dc are now handicapping the udc the dc core of the udc has at present become too decrepit to stand the pressure even of books and still less therefore of documentation the inadequacies cited against udc when it is compared with cc have a sonorous but unintelligible sound it does not for example have the capacity to impregnate the digits with the deeper unscheduled mnemonic quality    as freely as the c c   the criticisms of metcalfe ranganathan and shera against the dc core a rather misleading concept even though udc initially derived from dc are of a certain kind they relate to the philosophy or systematics of classification in general they are also in a sense criticisms of outsiders taking some kind of overview of the system more concrete criticism tends to come from within the ranks of udc users themselves this deals with the classification itself its present subdivisions their inadequate specifications and the illogical or erroneous conjunctions they present one might say that the first kind of criticism is more closely related to bibliographical application of the classification and the second to the derivation of the classification in the systematics of science and other kinds of s r ranganathan classification and international documentation review of docuimentation    ibid  bradford for example states that udc is nine times as extensive as the dewey code and instances organic chemistry as showing the sorts of development typically occurring in udc it has two thousand entries compared with twenty in dewey see universal decimal classification in his documentation op cit n  above p  one should of course on the other side also note the attempts made to gain correspondence between dc and udc at least to the first three places bradford was one of a committee of fid which had fruitful conversation with dr godfrey dewey on this matter see f donker duyvis report of the international committee of universal classification in fid proceedings of the fifteenth conference  pp c  the matter was still of interest as recently as  see g a lloyd comparison of the dewey and universal decimal classifications at a minimum figure level fid publication  the hague fid 
  the library quarterly knowledge the scientific specialists working on the revisions extensions and improvements of udc are not concerned with the auxiliary schedules or with their use in relation to the main tables in order to obtain the greatest possible degree of bibliographical specificity but with the elaboration and relation of subjects in the main tables themselves the problems they encounter there are mainly subject problems but they inevitably lead to the more basic awareness of the difficulties of extending and changing the notation of the main tables to permit intercalation of new subjects and rearrangements of the old at the same time ranganathan was formulating what might be thought basic criticisms of udc as both a bibliographic classification and one necessarily attempting to reflect the organization of knowledge scholten an insider was considering the latter aspect very closely from the point of view of the iuture development of the classification his observations and conclusions are very interesting the latter being similar to those of ranganathan when subjected to close logical scrutiny and confronted with the development of science and technology the order of the main divisions is illogical he concluded and parts of the classification have been wrongly developed or are now clearly antiquated but he recognizes the enormous difficulty of holding in balance the need to adjust the classification frequently so that it follows the trend of changing knowledge but becomes difficult to use and the need to hold the classification fairly stable so that it can act as a standard but thereby becomes antiquated and for that reason difficult to use too he also makes the extremely important distinction that the classification is not the decimal notation even though it is true that it was the determining factor which induced la fontaine and otlet to adopt dewey system in the present state of development of the system it can no longer be said that the decimal notation constitutes its principal characteristic above all udc is a classification ie a system which should be divided according to principles of consistency mutual exclusiveness and collocation that secondly it is a univcrsal classification and that thirdly this classification is divided according to a decimnal notation bradford upon encountering this kind of criticism or more specifically particular instances which it generalizes would agree that the classification may well be all of this but he would assert that it is primarily a bibliographic classification and would demand that the original purposes for which it was compiled be kept in mind before essaying criticism of it his comments on the criticism of the classification by j v jacks in the field of soil science are in this vein bradford stresses that the classification is not philosophic nor is the order of the subjects the main concern we must not forget that the primary purpose of the classification is not to put the literature of a science in order but to arrange all documents in such a way that they can be found as quickly as possible and to enable the many workers to collaborate in making a single comprehensive index of all knowledge in which all the references  w scholten the future development of the universal decimal classification reviewx of docaimentation   ibid pp    j v jacks the use of the universal decimal classification at the imperial bureau of soil service with discussion by bradford and others bsib proceedings   
the udc and fid  to the literature of a small topic can come together it is interesting that shera and egan were able to conclude that one consequence of bradford support of udc has been to encourage its establishment as a standard medium of communication that transcends the barriers of nationality and languagethis being in their view one of the important contribuitions of classification to the international world of scholarship these few but representative criticisms suggest that there is a continuing difficulty in understanding just what udc is trying to do the confusion arises from udc notation every bibliographic classification whether principally bibliographic or not has at least three important aspects the classification must relate to the world of knowledge and give it some meaningful structure every classification embodies willy nilly a philosophy of knowledge or is philosophical it reflects and represents the systematics of science and of knowledge in general it is taxonomic it must also permit subject specification and be sufficiently flexible to identify and relate to its main structure subjects meaningfully related bibliographically or not precisely enumerated in the classification itself it must also permit document specification each of these three aspects platitudes perhaps of classification theory depends upon the classification notation and though one must agree with scholten and with metcalfe who constantly urges that the distinction be kept clear that a classification is not its notation nevertheless for the classification to be known and used it must be represented symbolically by a notation one might generalize and say that different classifications tend to emphasize one or another of these aspects dewey with its rigidity of ordering the procrustean bed of the decimal ten from which it constantly tries to escape is oriented more to a world of knowledge whose unbridled growth has increasingly strained its categories and subdivisions to bursting point it is less capable of flexible and complex subject specification granted its necessity than say cc with its emphasis on the synthesis of elementary particles as the basis of subject indication udc on the other hand has a different kind of division of emphasis this has been tacitly recognized by its proponents and its critics alike it is a vast systematic table of subjects it is nothing less than a method for expressing notions of the mind in figures it is one of the most comprehensive classifications ever published it attempts to cover all variations of points of view it is a universal classificationit is a practical system for numerically coding information it goes beyond document specification and subject indication to document codification the original importance of the notation must be recognized but its ibid pp    shera and egan a review of the present state of librarianship and documentation op cit n  above p   it is interesting in this context to note that as early as  just before the spate of publications by ranganathan began the first edition of cc was issued in  duyvis reviewed trends in science towards synthetism and examined and rejected the possibility in the near future that udc would have to be reconstituted to deal with polydimensional representations along lines similar in broadest outline to those of cc f donker duyvis th report of the commission de la classification decimale documentatio universalis  pp   pollard the decimal bibliographic classification    op cit n  above p   fid universal decimal classification bsa op cit n  above p 
 the library quarterly continuing importance under the exigencies of effective classification must be deprecated the classification is in a sense schizophrenic there is a division between the classification itself the vast ordered elaboration of subjects and its notation they rival and conflict with each other for domination as a bibliographical classification it was designed minutely to specify the subjects contained in documents by using its notation to relate a given document to as much of the classification as possible so that its different relevances might be known a machinery of number compounding and reversal is provided for this but the classification the schedules and the signs of association can be used actually to express all the shades of ideologico bibliographical analysis of a document the notation then becomes primary and subordinates the classification to its own purpose which is essentially linguistic not bibliographic pollard briefly adverts to otlet belief that the notation of udc could be used as a language the decimal numbers being regarded as number roots which may be converted into number wordslby coupling with them auxiliary numbers expressing grammatical functions thus a medical corps will transport by cargo boat the enlisted volunteers affected with asiatic cholera becomes      by scrambling pollard suggests that such a device could be made into an effective cryptogrammic code bradford commenting on this wrote that the use of udc as the basis for an international language ay be all very well but its use as a secret code is nonsense for him all of this is irrelevant the only end for which the decimal classification is essential is for bibliographic co operation nevertheless it is important to recognize that there are as it were two identities often at conflict within udc one bibliographic and the other linguistic a pursuit of the origins of this latter aspect generally neglected along with a full understanding of what otlet and even bradford meant by bibliographic co operation helps to provide a new kind of historical perspective for both udc and fid iv otlet attempted resolution of the linguistic bibliographic duality in udc puts him into a particular stream of european philosophy in its most impassioned expressions his vision of bibliographic organization completely transcended the practical limitations that must necessarily have been imposed upon any contemporary manifestations of it and he saw in his mind eye a great dynamic global encyclopedia with tributary streams flowing into it and swelling it from every country in the world he is therefore the fellow of chambers buffon diderot and the other encyclopedists but his conception of udc as the complement of this vast international venture that is to say as an international language as an international documentary information encoding device places him in the company of a group of seventeenth century philosophers of whom dalgarno and wilkins were the most important to both groups classification was essential but the conjunction of these two elements in his theorizing suddenly presents us with otlet in conversation with a par pollard the documentary uses of decimal numbers op cit n  above p   bradford universal decimal classification op cit see n  above p 
the udc and fid   ticular seventeenth century philosopher and encyclopedist leibniz in the seventeenth century there was great concern over the nature of language and its inadequacies for scientific work especially after the decline of latin the use of which had precluded all the linguistic vagaries of a vernacular a movement had been begun to devise a language to take the place of latin a universal philosophic and scientific language which would be firstly an international auxiliary language for communication between people with different native tongues secondly a symbolic language for scientific purposes truly expressing the nature of things and thirdly an instrument for scientific inference moreover the character of the language the word the sign was to be not merely an arbitrary symbol for the thing but should indicate the thing nature it should as it were represent its real definition hopefully it would be like the symbolism of mathematics in its simplicity precision and convenience a method of proceeding was suggested by descartes this was to isolate a set of clear and simple ideas from which more complex notions could be synthesized classification therefore would become central to the venture bishop wilkins who actually invented such a language proceeded to find and arrange the fundamental and other notions and things by traditional definition per genus et difierentiam and tried to fit everything into an hierarchical organization like the taxonomic arrangements of botany or zoology leibniz however wanted to go further than these linguists he recognized that learned men have long since thought of some kind of language or universal characteristic by which all concepts and things can be put into beautiful order and with whose help different nations might communicate their thoughts and each read in his own language what another has written in his but he goes on proposing something new no one has attempted a language or characteristic which includes at once both the arts of discovery and of judgment that is one whose signs or characters serve the same purpose that arithmetical signs serve for numbers and algebraic signs for quantities taken abstractly this idea long remained with him leibniz tells us for with a characteristic such as he proposes the human race will have a new kind of instrument which will increase the power of the mind far more than any hitherto devised an instrument as otlet was to observe in a similar context capable of acting powerfully on the very form of thought itself how to arrive at the characteristic was the problem eventually leibniz concluded nothing more is necessary to establish the characteristic which i am attempting at least to a point sufficient to build the grammar of this wonderful language and a dictionary for the most frequent cases or what amounts to the same thing nothing more is necessary to set up the characteristic numbers for all ideas than to develop a philosophical and mathematical course of studies as it is called based on a certain new method which i can set forth   much of the following except where indicated is taken from k sparck jones synonymy and semanttic classification cambridge cambridge language research unit  appendix i thesaurus and synonym dictionaries separately paged esp pp   e gottfried w leibniz philosophical papers and letters a selection translated and edited by leroy e loemaker no  on the general characteristic  vols chicago university of chicago press    otlet traite de documentation op cit n  above p

the udc and fid  properly called information retrieval according to shera and egan udc is extremely important because it attempted to divorce classification from the book as physical object and permitted the retrieval of even the most minute conceptual units   from large agglomerations of accumulated record in shera and egan view before cleverdon vickery faradane foskett and the others came ranganathan before ranganathan came bradford but as has been shown for bradford documentation was udc and udc means otlet and his encyclopedic repertories one can point up the relevance of this sort of genealogy by a simple translation if for the numbers expressing the various constituent ideas facts themes of a given document as closely classified by udc as otlet would wish one substitutes descriptors precipitated from exhaustively indexing it and if for the concept of a classified repertory of printed cards of a standardized size and format one substitutes the concepts of punched cards or magnetic tape and mechanical or electronic sorting machines and especially the computer documentation otlet style may be seen to have a quite extraordinary contemporaneity this presents an interesting paradox for there can be no doubt that if the concepts discussed in the preceding pages were women fashions of an earlier age they could be described and dismnissed as quaint the paradox is heightened by other similarities there exists for both otlet style documentation and information retrieval a panaceatic literature both were regarded fearfully and unnecessarily as threats in traditional librarianship both were conceived of as enormous revolutions and completely new documentation had its visionaries and prophets and so does information retrieval and the prophets of both exclaim upon a promised land of complete bibliographical and information felicity into which their systems will lead the converted they provide a healthy corrective for each other the institutional aspect of documentation otlet style is important today for anyone interested in examining recent institutional developments in bibliographic organization in countries such as the united states and great britain and most interestingly in europe where supranational bodies having special information needs have appeared we are now witnessing after a period of natural evolution the gradual maturation of the information center the idea of such centers is far from being new as this paper shows its roots go back at least as far as otlet and the iib perhaps even to leibniz and his encyclopedia indeed the apparent permianence of this new kind of bibliographical agency now constitutes a belated justification for all of otletcs planning theorizing and striving but it were as though all this theorizing planning and striving with its strong global emphasis has gone for nothing information centers which in some ways i shera and egan a review of the present state of librarianship and documentation op cit n  above p   otlet anticipated punched cards edge notched as information storage devices and statistical machines permitting the development of a mechanically consultable book he also reviewed the effects for the transformation of the book of television the cinema sound recordings and above all of microphotography there was something of the bibliographical jules verne about him see his lvenir du livre et de la bibliographie op cit n  above pp   le livre microphotographique iib bulletin  pp   and his traite de documentation op cit n  above pp
