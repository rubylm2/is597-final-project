literature for children without marion edman t he title for this paper calls to mind a statement attributed to john ciardi fools give short answers to long questions certainly either literature for children or children without requires long answers it becomes increasingly clear as one tries to find published research and to tap the practical experiences of many people primarily teachers and librarians who for long years have tried to bring together the children in culturally deprived areas with the books in their libraries and school rooms the research is pitifully lacking and the reports of experience almost completely contradictory this is a not uncommon frustration in our age when we seem to know the answers but the questions we do not always know the discussion of this topic therefore might most profitably point the way to questions that must be raised before they can be answered only rigorous research highlighted by carefully evaluated practices in dealing with this special group of children and the ways that will lead them to books and reading can give us the answers we earnestly seek this does not discount the honest efforts many conscientious librarians and teachers have long been engaged in perhaps they were the first to discover what the sociologists and the politicians have recently become excited about the culturally deprived children in our society it is they who have really understood the importance of bringing these children into the main stream of american life which the politicians and sociologists now believe necessary if this country is to be transformed into the great society there are numerous generally wellknown sociological descriptions or definitions of the culturally deprived it should be pointed out that cultural deprivation is not monolithic this phenomenon has many faces and many degrees while there are no exact figures on what proportion of children and youth might fall into the category of general deprivation it is estimated to be between one fifth and one third of all our children the proportion is expected to increase many but not all live in the inner core of our large cities despite the disadvantages these children may suffer in varying degree it should be remembered that a considerable number do achieve success in school graduate from high school some even go to college and find a happy place for themselves in adult life they may find great pleasure in vicarious experiences far beyond their own circumscribed early beginnings including their pleasure in the use of libraries and books because a child grows up in an area where there is no grass does not mean ipso facto that he has become incapable of imagining a world that has luscious green fields sam levinson who grew up in harlem has promised  i wish to acknowledge the very considerable help i received from mr william curtis doctoral student at wayne state university who interviewed teachers librarians and students in the detroit area and wlio helped analyze questionnaires and answers from other cities thanks are also due the many librarians teachers and students who co operated with us 
literature for children without  to make this point clear in his autobiography everything but money claude brown in the story of his childhood in the same city manchild in the promised land and betty smith in a tree grows in brooklyn have demonstrated that a degrading sociological and economic environment does not entirely mold the mental and spiritual life of the child cultural deprivation may even bring children certain advantages these children may have seen more of the essential matters of life before they are ten than many more privileged children will see even as adults claude brown speaks of his own experience when i was very young about five years old maybe younger i would always be sitting out on the stoop i remember mama telling me and carole to sit on the stoop and not to move away from in front of the door even when it was time to go up and carole would be pulling on me to come upstairs and eat i never wanted to go because there was so much out there in that street you might see somebody get cut or killed i could go out in the street for an aftemoon and i would see so much that when i came in the house i be talking and talking for what seemed like hours dad would say boy why don you stop that lyin you know you didn see all that you know you didn see nobody do that but i knew i had while claude brown does not say in his autobiography that he found books an extension or an explanation of the exciting life he was leading doubtless there are today in the slums and in the deprived areas in the rural sections of our country numberless children who are able and eager to accept much of what we have in the way of books and reading to give them certainly many of them will look for greater sophistication in books than do usual children of their age but it is well known that these children are only a part of the total group perhaps a small minority and that it is probably most often this minority who come to the minds of teachers and librarians when they discuss the culturally deprived for these are the successes in the efforts of these workers who among us does not like to think about and talk about his successes the culturally deprived for whom books and reading might well be completely out of reach are those who are extremely deficient in their ability to use standard english the ordinary language of books those whose reading skills are so extremely limited that they have come to regard print as almost an exquisite instrument of torture those whose lives have been so warped that they cannot think of themselves as anything but failures in relation to what they believe society really wants of them those whose relationships with other persons have been so unsatisfactory that they find it difficult if not impossible to identify with real human beings to say nothing of fictional characters these are the children with whom this paper is concerned a brief discussion of their handicaps as they seem to relate to the children ability to understand and to find empathy with literature follows handicaps of speech in the area of speech handicaps there is good research let me review some of the more significant studies two studies by strickland and loban have attracted a great deal of attention the first is a horizontal study and the second is a longitudinal study of the actual speech patterns of children using the techniques of modern recording equipment modern linguistics and comput claude brown manchild in the promised land new york macmillan co  p

 the library quarterly snake this fish got a mouth like a big smile how and when to make the transition from this sort of language to the standard language of literary materials is a subject in need of a great deal of research the research now available suggests that much work must be done with children oral speech before change becomes easy ruth golden efforts in a detroit high school bears witness to this fact it seems important to point out one obstacle in initiating a program of producing and giving the children with deviant language the kind of reading matter that really communicates with them this is the intransigent position taken by those teachers librarians and leaders of minority groups who see the improvement of language as the sine qua non of upward mobility and release from slum status one linguist of note speaks rather bitingly to teachers on this point there is one subcultural factor which does affect the language development of these children and it is one which i wish to touch on now this factor is the set of attitudes toward language held by the teachers whom allison davis would call aspiring middle classas many teachers are these attitudes are partly learned in the school and college training of english teachers with its monolithic fixation on correct english as the main proper outcome of education in english and the language arts it is a fixation so deep that it is not felt as a subject for question it overrides whatever work in child development educational psychology or methods the teacher may have had even if these have been more enlightened about language than usual it is a fixation often nourished in the teacher own sense that only by parting with his origins learning correct english and moving out of the neighborhood has he been able to cut himself off from the foreign rural or working class ways of his parents and it frequently expresses itself as a demonstration of real love and concern for the children that they too should come up and out and away from a manner of life that is poverty stricken universally condemned and deadended negro teachers especially insisting that they cannot even understand the children whom they understand only too well bear down brutally on the divergent phonology grammar and usage of negro children communicating their own tension to the construction of the child ultimate trauma about language in most instances all the mores of the school sustain them in this unfortunate practice where they should resist it the alternative to this overemphasis on conformity to middle class speech too is unfortunate the idea that the children are so low on the intelligence scale that their case is hopeless and that the most the school can do is prepare them for the same manual occupations their parents engage in keeping them off the streets and out of trouble as long as possible in summary then the language disability of the culturally deprived child affects his use of books perhaps most particularly those of literary value as artley points out many children are in a position of learning to attach meaning to a printed symbol when the symbol lies outside their spoken vocabulary to understand a printed ten word sentence when normally they speak only a disjointed three word sentence to interpret a complex sentence when they have difficulty in using simple ones to follow the organization of a new story they are trying to read when they are unable to tell in logical order the events in i pond mississippi action for community education edwards miss mace press nd mimeographed  ruth i golden ways to improve oral communication of culturally different youth in arno jewett joseph mersand and doris v gunderson eds improving english skills of culturally different youth in large cities us office of education bulletin no  washington us office of edcucation  pp    donald lloyd subcultural patterns which affect language and reading ability in arno jewett joseph mersand and doris v gunderson eds improving english skills of culturally different youth in large cities us office of education bulletin no  washington us office of education  pp  
literature for children without  the familiar little red riding hood to read complete sentences with expression when they are unable to give emphatic expression to their own ideas to interpret punctuation marks when they attach no significance to gesture pantomimes and free play do not these studies of the modern linguists with their insistence that we respect the language of all children no matter how bad and that we learn to regard their speech as legitimate communication place upon teachers and librarians the responsibility to demand of authors and publishers the kind of language in books which these children really use do the studies not further suggest that we might carefully consider our attitudes toward proper language and finally do they not lay upon us the burden of discovering the techniques whereby the gradual transition from slum language to acceptable norms of speech is accomplished does this not all add up to the proposition that we help these children to become in effect bilingual handicaps of poor reading skills it should be noted that for those children who have not mastered the basic reading skills books of any sort are to be avoided because all they can do is to give the child a sense of shame and defeat while the contention of modern reading experts that johnny really can read is true it is equally true that an appalling number of children are so handicapped in reading ability that they must be classed at best as semiliterate in a recent newspaper release of reading levels for a high school in a depressed area of detroit the board of education indicated that in a graduating class of  seniors only  were reading at grade level on the standardized reading test given at the school one might well ask what kinds of books the students in such situations might read with guidance and help from teachers what sorts of books librarians could beguile them into taking for voluntary and recreational reading even though the tests given might not be a fair measure of each child real ability and certainly not of his potential as a reader harm has been done in establishing a label for him as an inadequate reader of which he himself is more or less painfully aware while there is a paucity of research that is truly diagnostic in determining the real causes why the culturally disadvantaged child usually has such tremendous problems in learning to read one fact seems quite clear and that is as was pointed out earlier that he has not begun reading with materials that make sense to him either in language or in subject matter he has never looked upon reading in terms of my favorite definition for that complex process a child definition reading is talk wrote down a reading program in any language at any stage in a student career is likely to be effective to the degree that it parallels the language habits that the student has acquired in speaking in terms of the language usage of all children in relation to reading many questions concerning needed research have been raised one writer in the field lists these  what is the process of learning to read in linguistic and sociological terms  what is dialectology  what is the general dialectical situation in american english  how a sterl artley oral language growth and reading ability elementary school journal  february    the detroit news may   p

 the library quarterly more to increase than to alleviate the feelings of insecurity and inferiority that the culturally deprived child brings with him as he enters into contact with this segment of his world a recent book describing this process is titled edutcation for alienation many psychologists and sociologists insist that the kindergarten child from the slums is a far healthier individual in his personal and interpersonal relationships than he will be at any later stage of his school life if this unhappy situation is now true and is to be reversed what shall be the role of books is it by identifying with others in like trouble or is it by identifying with individuals who were successes that these children gain a more favorable perspective of themselves and their rightful place in the society should this identification be with their own race or minority group should it be with those whose achievements are within the realm of possibility for themselves or with those who were the particularly fortunate unfortunates answers to these questions seem now in the realm of the unknown here is probably the area where librarians can help most but perhaps they will need the assistance of trained psychologists the universality of children interests all studies of the general interests of culturally deprived children show that they do not vary markedly from those of so called normal children they enjoy television and look at the same programs they laugh at humorous situations they understand tragic and disappointing ones they can be led with appropriate methods to enjoy rhyme and rhythm stories of adventure stories of animals stories of real life in other words their interests are as broad as life and as wide as the subjects dealt with in books the key to success here is now as it has ever been the interested and resourceful librarian who makes a real study of getting the right book to the right child a real problem is how to multiply the number of such librarians available to children the place of literature just exactly what literature should be provided for the culturally deprived child is still a debatable matter among teachers and librarians for this reason the following definition of literature for children will be used that body of children books which in the combined judgments of teachers and librarians has been included in the lists compiled by respected and reputable professional organizations such as the ala ncte acei and others these lists include books of a wide variety of formats dealing with a wide variety of topics and certainly far from equal in that elusive quality good literary style these are the books found on the shelves of the average public library the books in the school library or the classroom the books that are being purchased for the special projects now being set up for the culturally deprived these are the materials now available for use with children it is to our advantage in dealing with culturally deprived children that we have a broad spectrum of materials from which to choose rather than a narrow range of materials that somehow have been labeled real literature our clientele presents too broad a spectrum of special problems to be encompassed narrowly it may well be that research will indicate that we need an even athaniel hickerson education for alienation englewood cliffs nj prentice hall inc
