journal of education for librarianship exhibition catalogs a collection of exhibition catalogs can be a most useful source of information for teaching books and printing a number of these are generally available for sale at the time of the exhibition and also by order both from the descriptive commentaries and illustrations exhibition catalogs can be helpful as a source for the study of various periods or particular books their number is much too numerous to list here but there is one which has probably surpassed all others in its appeal and value in printing and the mind of man catalogue of the exhibitions at the british museum and at earvs court london july    london the british museum  which is also available in hardcover as john carter and percy muir printing and the mind of man new york holt rhinehart and winston cl  this is an  nvaluable catalog containing information on printing mechanisms and printed materials arranged to illustrate the history of western civilization and the means of the multiplication of literary texts since the xvth century dealers catalogs teachers of the history of books and printing also find dealers catalogs a most useful source for the descriptions and illustrations which they contain this relates to the catalogs of sale items published from time to time by the antiquarian book trade although their major purpose is for the sale of the items listed they are also invaluable source items there are a large number of such dealers catalogs constantly being mailed out to libraries and book collectors and it is advisable to request being placed on the mailing list for a select number which the instructor feels will be useful to students last year there was one dealers catalog which will probably rank as one of the most outstanding examples of this type this is the monumenta xylographica et typographica the cradle of printing part ii new york h p kraus  this catalog lists a dazzling array of the book world treasures which have been assembled by kraus the introduction to the catalog states that never before in the th century has so formidable an assemblage of great printed books been displayed and offered for sale in a catalogue perhaps it never can be done again the list includes the gutenberg bible cl the shuckburgh copy in the largest paper copy extant
