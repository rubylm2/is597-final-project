the library quarterly volume xxviii april  number  the national library of medicine ii dorothy m schullian and frank b rogers international recognition   the plodding years had had their vision which had in turn been realized volume i a berlinski of the index catalogue of the library of the surgeon general office united states army was published in  in fifteen hundred copies with authors and subjects arranged in dictionary order in a single alphabet it immediately elicited congratulatory messages from countless members of the medical profession the world over in his submittal letter to surgeon general barnes june   billings acknowledged in particular the valuable assistance which he had received from fletcher assistance which had gone far beyond mere routine or the limits of office hours and prudently called attention to a fact even now too often ignored that the index catalogue is not a complete medical bibliography but a catalog of what is to be found in a single collection nor has it ever been a full catalog of that single collection billings himself as year after year went by and volume after volume was published acknowledged sins of both omission and commission he granted also that in spite of a first rough assortment his nocturnal hours with the clothes basketsl much rubbish was perforce included in the collection for the proportion of what is both new and true is not much greater in medicine than it is in theology and a great national collection could only make the whole accessible to those who wished to use it in addition modern classifiers will find much to criticize in the system of subject headings and in the arrangement of books on the shelves while a single alphabetical arrangement by some two hundred rubrics liver cirrhosis of dispenses with inconveniences inherent in a system of arbitrary numerals it does not guarantee quick location of the book itself the important thing to recognize is that the library continued to grow that the index catalogue continued to appear and that in the year  when volume xvi w zythus concluded the first series which was not so termed in its course any medical student writing a dissertation here or abroad on the surgical treatment of epilepsy had under firm control the bulk of the literature which he needed billings and fletcher co operated in another venture which though never a government publication was intimately 
 the library quarterly connected for over a half century with the library of the surgeon general office they had seen early the need for a monthly serial which would index under subject headings current books and articles in medicine surgery and the collateral branches and they shrewdly turned their venture to the library advantage wrote billings in the first issue of january   all books pamphlets and periodicals sent by their author or publishers to the index medicus will after record and analysis for that journal be placed in the library of the surgeon general office and the hope that the contributions to the library from this source will be large and thus permit of the application of the limited fund provided by government for its support to the purchase of the many works still required to make it fairly complete has been my main inducement for undertaking to furnish the necessary data beyond the satisfaction in thus contributing to the convenience of medical writers and teachers and to the completeness of the library under my charge i have no personal or pecuniary interest in the enterprise on the title page he is inscribed simply surgeon us army fletcher simply mrcs eng within the pages of the index medicus it was stated the practitioner will find the titles of parallels for his anomalous cases accounts of new remedies and the latest methods in therapeutics the teacher will observe what is being written or taught by the masters of his art in all countries the author will be enabled to add the latest views and cases to his forthcoming work or to discover where he has been anticipated by other writers and the publishers of medical books and periodicals must necessarily profit by the publicity given to their productions such splendor of alliteration cannot have helped when as deplored in the second issue foreign journals were irregular and late in arriving it has been decided that the most practical plan will be to index everything as it is received or when a long established house in paris through which french periodicals were obtained suddenly suspended business immediate steps have been taken to insure the speedy transmission of the missing journals the venture was never practical financially subscription rates were high and private publishers can fail and can die place of publication shifted from new york to detroit to boston and washington during the first twenty years and as late as  there were only  subscriptions of which  came from the united states army medical department  from the rest of the united states and  from other countries but it served well those who received it and it brought to the library by special entreaty countless reports of hospitals asylums dispensaries and municipal boards of health as well as printed bills or ordinances relating to medical education or public health which had been introduced andor passed in state and municipal legislative bodies for billings comprehended the importance of documents and as the indexcatalogue and the index medicus went out that side the water so official documents showered in from liechtenstein and san marino haiti and greenland somaliland and zanzibar later an attempt was made to revive the index medicus in paris and for the long period   a solution was found under the patronage of the carnegie institution in  the index medicus was merged with the quarterly cumulative index of the american medical association and in  the quarterly cumulative index medicus was removed entirely from the library which had conceived its progenitor the library has now a quasi lineal and thriving descendant in the current list of medical literature billings renown had spread nationally and internationally whether part and parcel of the library or vice versa it is sometimes impossible to distinguish
the national library of medicine  to many he seemed to be the library in  william a hammond whose court martial by stanton had been reversed by congress and who had won for himself great professional respect in new york returned to washington irked by a statement in the minutes of the medical society of the county of new york that dr john s billings had founded the national medical library he informed the society that while he desired in no way to detract from credit due dr billings he himself had founded the library several years before dr billings was stationed at the city of washington billings on february   calmly set down a few facts in reply which he allowed to speak for themselves for many years there was a small collection of medical books and journals in the surgeongeneral office at washington which collection was commenced by surgeon general lovell prior to  at the commencement of the war this collection amounted to between three and four hundred volumes dr hammond entered on his duties as surgeon general april   and left washington august   after which date he was not on duty in this office during this interval three hundred and fiftynine volumes were purchased for the use of the office during the years  and  about  volumes were added to the library mainly works selected by drs woodward and otis when the library came under my charge in the fall of  it contained as shown by a catalogue made at the time about  volumes at this date it contains about  volumes and  pamphlets this whiplash given billings went serenely on his way year by year appropriations for both library and index catalogue eventually were made in spite of the rhythmic spasms as he once expressed it of partial economy with which some of our statesmen are afflicted accession figures climbed and were carefully printed for all to see in the annual report of the surgeon general and implicitly by numbers of titles in the submittal letters to the successive volumes of the index catalogue the ideal was to obtain as soon as published every new medical work great or small in all languages though the budget and other factors never permitted its full realization dealers learned to admire billings sagacity in purchases and to respect his belief that public funds were a trust from a list of old books sent by dr toner he would offer for example  for no   for no   cents for no  and  cents for no  is no  medical  as you know it is somewhat difficult to make offers for books without having an opportunity of examining them as so much depends on the condition of the copies etc nor were books in his library in the category of those rarely consulted except by one or two species of beetles loans went direct to physicians on payment of a deposit fee which was returned when the book was once again safely on the shelves in  two thousand letters were written in response to requests for medical information serious bibliographers were aided at every turn by this hod carrier as he called himself who brought together the bricks made by one set of men in order that another set of men might build therewith but when he received a letter stating that the writer was about to prepare a paper for his county medical society on tumors of the liver and would be glad to have as complete a list of references as possible to all articles reports of cases or statistics on this subject and that the paper had to be ready in two weeks he knew that what the writer wanted was one of the recent encyclopedias of medicine and he advised accordingly the cordiality of his relations with individuals and institutions of similar in
 the library quarterly tent is nowhere better expressed than in his remarks at a dinner of the college of physicians in philadelphia on april   i rise to respond with great pleasure an unusual thing under such circumstances as the pleasure usually attends the sitting down my pleasure is due largely to the fact that it gives me an opportunity to acknowledge the cordial sympathy and valuable aid which the medical departments he was magnanimously including the navy for was not his a national medical library of the government have always received from the college of physicians of philadelphia their relations have always been intimate as i could easily show you but this is not the time for a historical essay i will merely remind you that one of the founders of the college was the first surgeon general of the army namely dr john morgan from some of the remarks made this evening you will no doubt have inferred that the college of physicians has a branch library in washington the nation too went on its way though not always serenely and its development like that of medicine and science in general inevitably affected the library of the surgeon general office president james a garfield attended by surgeon general barnes as abraham lincoln had been died september   from the bullet of a disgruntled office seeker public reaction in combination with other circumstances forced the passage a year later of the pendleton act which in spite of its weaknesses became the foundation for federal civil service in its present form all government agencies were eventually affected and pitchforking disappeared along with greater evils chester a arthur succeeded garfield and retained robert todd lincoln as secretary of war in  edison developed the incandescent light and in the same year electric current was first used in arc lamps in washington with lister and pasteur came a new age in medicine military and civil in  george miller sternberg isolated the pneumococcus and photographed the tubercle bacillus in  also joseph h woodward became the first army officer to be honored with the presidency of the american medical association the act of june   compelling retirement for officers and soldiers after forty years of active service or when an officer had reached the age of sixty four hit immediately surgeon general barnes who was already nearly a year beyond that age limit and billings lost an active and steady advocate george a otis who had been a moving spirit in the army medical museum and the medical and surgical history of the war of the rebellion died in  and joseph h woodward of whom the same can be said in  after several years of poor health on december   surgeon general murray consolidated the army medical museum and the library of the surgeon general office into the museum and library divrision billings was put in charge of both units the second and third floors of the building on tenth street were assigned to the division and all the clerks engaged in library work were transferred there he accepted the new duty as he had all others since he first received his commission in  familiarized himself with it and in  made it the subject of a masterly presidential address before the congress of american physicians and surgeons surgeon general barnes once publication had been assured for the indexcatalogue had begun hammering away at another objective suddenly in his annual report for the year ending june   appears a caption a new fire proof building a necessity for the army medical museum and library it is repeated for  for
the national library of medicine   and by his successor for  the condition of the building at nos   tenth streeth nw was overcrowded and unsafe whoever has even a small personal library will wonder how much the weight of the books had contributed to this condition space was inadequate not merely for proper display of the collections but even for satisfactory storage the building was surrounded by inflammable houses and sheds on private property over which no official control could be exercised the smithsonian had already had a sad experience with fire in  the patent office in  and a fire which did occur on the private property next door in january  had been subdued only by the exertions of the employees of the building fortunately before any damage was done its walls were both weak and out of plumb if the roof went they would fall the museum collection on the third floor would already have been involved and the destruction of the contents of the lower floors including the library the record and pension division and the division of surgical records would result a new building adequate for present needs and reasonable future expansion was a necessity such a building added barnes should be absolutely fire proof but no expenditure for mere architectural display is required i find on inquiry that a suitable structure can be erected at a cost not to exceed two hundred and fifty thousand dollars  while ideas on what is fireproof and what is not can change in fifty or sixty or seventy years these words apart from the sum involved ring familiar to denizens of the present library it is not clear why something already a necessity in  could become more imperative two years later but so it did in the annual report for  after the president in his message to congress had given such figures as  volumes  pamphlets  specimens and  bound volumes of hospital records which are daily searched for evidence needed in the settlement of large numbers of pension and other claims for the protection of the government against attempted frauds as well as for the benefit of honest claims when it was pointed out that no advantage would accrue from merging the library with any other specifically the library of congress when phrases like world wide celebrity extreme jeopardy irreparable loss and constant peril began to be hurled and when the members of congress were bombarded by the verbal missiles of the entire medical profession of the country marshaled by samuel d gross austin flint and oliver wendell holmes and acting as one man it was finally enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled and approved by president arthur on march   two days before the inauguration of grover cleveland that a brick and metal fireproof building to be used for the safekeeping of the records library and museum of the surgeon general office of the united states army    be constructed upon the government reservation in the city of washington in the vicinity of the national museum and the smithsonian institution at a cost not to exceed  all jesting aside the action was taken none too soon and barnes and his successors had been justified in their predictions of calamity if not of fire on june   between  and  am mr ford building already of tragic history collapsed when a pillar which had been undermined in connection with electric wiring was left without shoring the pity is
 the library quarterly that  persons remained in the building from the records and pension division and that of these  were killed and  injured the contract for the new building was awarded to messrs bright  humphrey of washington working under supervision of the united states engineer corps and in particular colonels t l casey and j m wilson the reduction by  in the sum allowed necessitated the omission of a small back building and a number of other changes these changes inevitably resulted in a very plain and simple building somewhat reduced in size but not impaired in its security and it was believed that the building could afford space sufficient for all absolute necessities for some years to come estimates submitted on september   included  for stacks of bookcases in library hall together with iron supports stairs and perforated gallery floors  for cases for the museum  for carpets and furniture  for construction of a boiler house including latrines alcohol still room and coal vaults and  for gas fixtures by the fall of  the present building at the corner of seventh street and b street now independence avenue sw was completed it was occupied by the museum on february   the first bookwas accessioned there at  pm on august   cool and pleasant and on september   the library celebrated there somewhat tardily its fiftieth anniversary dribbling along in succeeding years come estimates for items not admitted by the original appropriations in  for ceiling screens for museum and library halls  in the same year for linoleum to cover the floors of the library offices and smaller exhibit rooms  in  for laying asphalt pavement between the center of the building and its wings in october  the army medical school opened in the building its first session occupying parts of the first and third floors its faculty included walter reed as professor of clinical and sanitary microscopy and john shaw billings as professor of military hygiene billings continued to represent the library at national and international meetings even when he had to file in the court of claims a petition against the united states for the sum of  which he had spent traveling  miles on the orders of the surgeon general and which was then disallowed by the second comptroller the money was indeed due him he had as ordered attended the international medical congress in london conferred with agents there and on the continent on systems of literary exchange and condition of books secured exchanges with leading libraries and medical schools examined hospital and library buildings and investigated methods of vital statistics in  and  his friends were active in his behalf for his appointment as surgeon general on neither occasion did he lift a finger in his own behalf on the first he informed president gilman that some lectures which he was scheduled to give at the hopkins might have to be postponed if he received the appointment if rumor is correct he wrote the president is inclined to appoint me as the best means of settling permanently the scramble but hesitates to jump so many men and also because it is urged on him that i am merely a scientific and literary man but of little executive or business capacity on the second occasion he expressed his gratitude for the efforts of his friends but
the national library of medicine  pointed out that this repeated contest for an office was very repugnant to him his renown resulted from many fields suffice it to mention here for a parallel in  that in   he had been consulting surgeon to the secretary of the treasury to assist in the reorganization of the marine hospital service but the labor of love was the library which as he reported in  in the final volume of the first series of the index catalogue contained then  books and  pamphlets practically all of which had been obtained in the preceding thirty five years and onesixth of which had been presented either in exchange or as direct gifts few were the medical writers then living who had not presented at least one pamphlet he appended a list of contributors among whom stood high mr thomas windsor of manchester england duplicates received through the index medicus had been useful for exchange purposes he conceded that this was probably the last volume of the index catalogue which would be issued under his personal supervision and expressed gratitude that he had been allowed to complete the series at this time appropriations for the library exclusive of costs of printing the index catalogue ran  or  in place of the  allotted for the several years immediately preceding in one of which  he had pronounced the condition of the library as fairly satisfactory and its future prospects as excellent he may have seen some handwriting on the wall and he complained in particular of two things there were in the first place difficulties in getting old books and to check off a catalog of a thousand medical books and find about four which were really desirable a dozen which could be accepted as filling gaps and about twenty small theses which were not in the collection involved an amount of clerical work which cost as much as if not more than the books thus obtained in the second place he would have liked a change in the law to permit the library to have its binding done in its own building and under its own control by this time the hospital corps had been established and permanently attached to the medical department of the army it participated in its first engagement at the battle of wounded knee creek in south dakota on december   bacteriology and hygiene had been accepted as existing facts the interstate commerce commission had been created the sherman antitrust act had been passed and growing economic distress and mass unemployment were soon to result in the march of coxey army on washington the library wrote billings bravely and modestly is not dependent on the skill or energy or goodwill of any one man it is becoming more and more known to and more and more used by the members of the medical profession and so long as they are interested in it the necessary appropriations will be made and the skilled force employed to increase preserve and catalogue it meanwhile on march   mr fielding h garrison later fielding h garrison md later colonel fielding h garrison mc usa was assigned to duty as clerk in the library at  per annum on past momentum   john shaw billings departed in  first for the new department of hygiene of the university of pennsylvania and then on the recommendation of dr s weir mitchell his warm friend since the war of secession to consolidate the
 the library quarterly astor lenox and tilden foundations and build where a reservoir had stood before the new york public library at the library of the surgeon general office business proceeded much as before he had already seen the need to commence a second series of the indexcatalogue based on books and articles which had been received too late for insertion in the first series his cards were up to date the manuscript for the letter a covering all that had accumulated since that letter was published in  was ready for the press congress had voted the appropriation and the reliable fletcher was at hand to carry on in one respect however and in a respect which would affect the whole future of the library his calculations were incorrect he foresaw for the second series five volumes of the same size and style as those in the first series this was in line with his opinion that although current medical literature was increasing in amount the rate of increase was becoming slower and that medical writers were not increasing in proportion with the population or even with the physicians among that population the second series ran on the contrary not to five volumes but to twenty one five more than the first series had needed and by its last volume which issued in  there was again a huge accumulation for example of everything received for the letter a since its first volume of  but no hint of discouragement no trace of doubt is apparent the index medicus was supplying current wants the index catalogue would eventually reach the letter z and the word backlog even when breathed seems not to have had the power to shame and terrify that it possesses today billings knew from abundant battle experience that medicine can make significant advances in time of war but he had not foreseen the destruction of the maine much less the sinking of the lusitania the problem of typhoid alone in the spanish american war called forth a flood of literature which with that on the same subject from other countries swelled greatly the fever section of the index catalogue which appeared in  yellow fever and malaria were being solved the dodge commission investigated the conduct of the medical department as of the entire war department in the war with spain and as a result various reforms were instituted an army nurse corps was created in  and an army dental corps in  the walter reed general hospital was opened in  in addition advances made elsewhere the roentgen ray and salvarsan were adopted by the medical department and as medicine progressed everywhere the library perforce amassed its literature by  it contained  volumes and  pamphlets exclusive of transactions of societies the current periodicals on file numbered  these apart from gifts and exchanges had been obtained on annual appropriations which rose again by the act approved on march   to  and continued steadily at that figure except for a reduction of  in   through  in the annual reports of the surgeon general over many years the holdings are divided statistically into bound items medical journals medical transactions theses pamphlets and other medical books and unbound theses and pamphlets there were never of course sufficient funds for binding but bound or unbound on shelves or in boxes the items required space and
the national library of medicine  rather early it became clear that the prediction of a sufficiency of space in the new building for some years to come had verged considerably on the optimistic other branches had also made inroads on what space there was the creation of the army medical school which held its sessions there until  has already been mentioned and in addition one large room originally designed for library purposes had been converted to the use of the record and pension office in  less than a decade after the completion of the new building it became evident that available shelf room would soon be exhausted and an appropriation of  was requested for the construction of six additional iron bookstacks it was not granted by  there was actual embarrassment in properly caring for the collections duplicates were crowded inaccessibly in basement rooms the large room of the record and pension office was needed for the display and care of the originals and the surgeon general requested that the whole of the museum and library building be restored to its legitimate purpose it was not restored year after year congress failed to make an appropriation for bookstacks wrote surgeon general robert m oeilly in  the amount of money asked for has of necessity been increased not because any more extensive construction is now wanted than when first estimated for but because the price of both material and workmanship seems to have doubled unless the appropriation now estimated at  is allowed without further delay the library will be unable to locate its own books without great delay and trouble new books for lack of shelf room are stacked upon the floors and piled on top of the rows as near as possible to the section where they would naturally be placed if there were room enough this library is recognized as the largest sic and most useful medical library in the world it is in constant use by nearly every american university medical library and society and by hundreds of individual workers the library force indexes practically all the existent literature of medicine in all its branches the index catalogue of subjects as well as authors is a handbook in every great library at home and abroad the shelves asked for are now absolutely necessary to the continuance of the efficiency of the library and will it is believed if granted be sufficient for the present collection and its increase for ten years the sum of  was finally appropriated and the six additional bookstacks sufficient to accommodate the regular increase of the library for several years as it was estimated in  were completed earlier there had been a movement to transfer the library to the jurisdiction of the smithsonian and later there was pronounced agitation in favor of union with the library of congress with the addition of the new bookstacks however all was seemingly quiet until  when the army medical school departed the rooms which it had vacated were pressed into service in what seems to have been the nick of time and the sum of  was obtained for the renovation of the entire building including repainting of the interior extensive repairs to the roof and heating plant and installation of completely new plumbing this was the era in which the science of librarianship was coming to the fore the library was in constant touch with other libraries and with new methods the name of melvil dewey is numbered among its correspondents from the very accident of its birth however it held itself apart even later from the new movement which emphasized special training for a young man or woman embarking upon a library career granted that it was the national medical library it was first military and its librarian was an army officer de
 the library quarterly tailed to it sometimes for a relatively brief period from duties which usually had little connection with books he would ordinarily be transferred from it to other duties which were likewise divorced from books with the best will in the world he could scarcely further its interests in the manner which had been vouchsafed to billings in his thirty years of service walter d mccaw was permitted to remain for ten years champe c mcculloch for five and their names are honored on the library rolls in other contingencies the librarian would be shifted thrice in a year and walter reed who once said that it was the highest ambition of his life to be billings successor had only a few days in the office before his sudden death greater continuity prevailed in fletcher who was still laboring valiantly for the library almost to his death in  at the age of ninty in fielding h garrison in albert allemann who edited the index catalogue from  until much against his will he was retired for age in  and in a number of faithful servants in other positionsthe names of edward shaw f l apel h  hall thomas a wise felix neumann charles g toepper f w stone and baruch israeli come at once to mind here were no trained librarians however an acquaintance with medicine sufficient to determine the subject headings for the index catalogue and an acquaintance with languages sufficient to list the foreign books for the index catalogue and to furnish translations as needed were the controlling factors in appointment in addition the library was suffering severely in the first decade of the twentieth century from the loss of old clerical employees who as stated in the annual report of the surgeon general had been with the institution from its inception and whose expenrence and special knowledge made possible the conduct of the library with a minimum clerical force the places of these men have been filled by new clerks from the civil service list who however promising had not specially qualified for library work and who must necessarily consume time in familiarizing themselves with their duties much time is lost in filling vacancies as about a month is required in each case to obtain certifications to make the selections and to appoint the candidate the force is also crippled by age and infirmities of several of its members still in service the work of the library both in its service to the public and in its cataloguing has therefore gradually and inevitably dropped behind yet a comparison recently made of the catalogue work of different years shows that compared with twenty years ago fully twice as many titles are now carded and indexed    volume xvii of the index catalogue is in course of preparation and will appear in due time but owing to the weakness of the clerical force from conditions already mentioned the appearance of the volume is delayed here then is admission that there were weaknesses in both the library and the federal civil service and year after year the pleas are repeated for more dependable and more numerous personnel there is scarcely a mention of previous library training at present continued the surgeon general the loss of a qualified clerk of the higher grade experienced in library work a graduate in medicine or a bibliographer results consequent upon promotions in the surgeon general office in a vacancy in the grade of clerk at  and it is hopeless to expect to obtain a specially trained man at such a low salary in  the principal assistant librarian was receiving   the assistant librarian  and two translators  each and here at last we read that these positions for which increases were requested are with one exception filled and must be filled by graduates in medicine who are also linguists

the national library of medicine  in  the present then and now building was termed obsolete crowded and non fireproof said the surgeon general there should be no delay in erecting in some central spot in our capital city a modern fireproof structure adequate in every respect to house for all sic time in safety what is justly considered to be the most useful as well as the most extensive collection relating to medicine and science ever achieved omitted perhaps deliberately is any designation of this central spot in any case a request december   for an estimate of  for plans was disapproved the following month and the library claim to land to be purchased by an act of july   contiguous to walter reed general hospital for the final location of the army medical museum the surgeon general library and the army medical school remained in abeyance the museum meanwhile had become more and more dissociated from the library in  it was functioning under the laboratory division of the surgeon general office adjustments in the present then and now building included conversion of the room underneath library hall vacated at last by the adjutant general and his record and pension office into a combined public reading room and repository for the collections of bound and current periodicals bookstacks were erected there a staircase was constructed to lead to the upper library hall and the bookstacks on the upper floor were accordingly relieved for visiting research workers who require space and quietude cubicles and private tables were set apart in library hall reclassification and permanent shelf listing along approved modern lines were undertaken said the surgeon general partly because the old shelf classification of many years standing is now obsolete and partly in view of the possibility of the acquisition of a new building for the library at the walter reed general hospital with a modern reclassification of the alcoves and definite shelf lists it will be possible to transport the books under any given subject intact in packages and place them in definitely selected positions in the enlarged bookstacks of the prospective building without any change of alphabetical order or loss of material six hospital corps men were detailed by the surgeon general for this work which has gone on continuously through the year the year was  and plans were actually under way for the move across the city which was never consummated the third series of the index catalogue had been promised in the last volume of the second series and by the cooperation of herbert putnam at the library of congress all titles of books and pamphlets accessioned in the library after july   were to be printed by the library of congress and kept in library hall in special file cabinets duplicate copies of these cards can be obtained from the library of congress at small cost and both libraries and private collectors were encouraged to purchase them succeeding volumes do not repeat the invitation volume i of the third series appeared in  the other nine volumes in succession at oneor two year intervals the expectation voiced in volume i that the new series would be as extensive as the first and seconfd was soon shattered by the discouragement and doubt which a now recognized backlog of titles occasioned pamphlet volumes it was decided should be omitted even from volume i under the names of the authors for the reason that such reprints when not representing a complete set of subject titles under an author name have never been given in the classical bibliographies of

 the library quarterly  dr beatrix bickel and dr claudius f mayer were carrying on in  his duties and those of dr allemann the civilian personnel of the library consisting of one principal librarian one senior librarian one chief library assistant two junior librarians twenty clerks and two messengers attended the celebration in full if not numerous force it is gratifying to note that three former librarians were also able to be present colonel james m phalen colonel percy m ashburn and major later major general edgar erskine hume the librarian of the army medical library at the time of the celebration was newly appointed colonel harold wellington jones who entered on duty september   had seen service in the philippines mexico and france and from  to  had been commanding officer at tripler general hospital in hawaii the reader librarian wil already have comprehended the problems which he faced on his arrival personnel was insufficient in  it totaled thirty vacancies were constantly occurring replacement through civil service was slow and the library was kept chronically short handed even with authorization granted there could be no material enlargement space was at a premium and the army medical museum was still occupying a substantial portion of the museum and library building any considerable additions in personnel could quite simply not be accommodated the number did rise by  to thirty seven and at various times a handful of appointees from the national youth administration were temporarily employed on specific projects each for a maximum of eighty hours per month it was clearly recognized also that the organization of personnel dictated as it was by tradition and custom was inadequate and that in the event of removal to a new building an entirely different arrangement would be necessary in  in fact one timid organizational step was taken by consolidating into a single office the book accession department and the periodical accession department again and again the secreary of war had to be reminded that a regular appropriation of  a year was necessary in order to keep current the collection of medical literature for   this was granted whereupon since on it neither rare books nor any technical apparatus could be purchased  was requested this figure is of course only approximate but certainly is a moderate one and does not err on the side of liberality it too was granted accessions increased substantially in  by which time the european war was seriously interfering with the flow of material from the continent the holdings passed the mark of a million and in the following year colonel jones acquired by special arrangement an outstanding collection of arabic medical manuscripts it is scarcely necessary to point out that to house the new accessions repeated and enormous ingenuity was required of the staff emergency shelving was inserted here there and in every corner where fire regulations and precautions on weight permitted in   to the amount of  after which steel shelving was also purchased to replace makeshift wooden shelves nor is it necessary to touch on the problem of binding which was like the poor for it funds never sufficed even as regarded current needs and in addition thousands of the library books which had had hard use through the years andor had suffered
the national library of medicine  from washington atmosphere the smoke and dirt of a century a leaky roof and ill fitting clerestory windows were in dire need of rebinding one new problem had arisen in years gone by the library had depended on the army medical museum to fill with its photographic equipment the few requests received for reproduction of a title page or of a specific passage usually from some old classic of medicine but in the thirties that great wonder microfilm was beginning to revolutionize the habits of scholars by encouraging them to consult in their own studies or laboratories entire books reduced to a few inches or feet of film the library saw the wisdom of keeping pace with other libraries in this new development in  the annual report of the surgeon general contains its first mention of bibliofilms when the bibliofilm service of the department of agriculture sent a man to the library two or three times a week to operate a microfilm camera furnished by dr atherton seidell by the next year the american documentation institute was operating in the library as in certain other government libraries a microfilm service on a non profit basis  orders were filled in that year to a total of  pages of material it was soon apparent that the service would eventually become a far more integral part of the library activities in the developing stages it was taken under the wing of an organization specially formed to foster it the friends of the army medical library thereupon encouraged by every means within the power of dr seidell its generous and indefatigable sponsor it grew by leaps and bounds in the first ten months   orders to the number of  were filled on  feet of film for  customers including  individuals  universities medical schools hospitals and research institutions  commercial firms  foreign countries and  government departments to assist users of the medicofilm service the friends began in  to publish weekly and privately a modest but highly convenient current list of medical literature which under forty four broad headings listed current journal articles available for filming over the lusty infant which like the index medicus could not have been conceived apart from the bibliographical resources of the library colonel jones watched anxiously and fondly in january  the child was officially adopted privately published under the auspices of the friends of the army medical library reads the title page of volume ii but below stands solidly the imprint the army medical library th st  independence ave sw washington dc in june photoduplication service became a fundamental part of the library and in january  the decision was made to supply microfilm without cost not only to the surgeon general office and apo addresses o the postmaster whether new york or san francisco but also to all government offices and to all individuals connected with accredited institutions it was an unusual experiment in library economy the statement read the library recognizes that microfilm copying is a service which publicly supported reference libraries may well perform on an equal basis with that provided for readers and by interlibrary loans in the pursuance of such a policy microfilms will be sent without charge in lieu of the loan of books to those who prefer them or where books or journals cannot be loaned volume i of the fourth series of the index catalogue had almost died
 the library quarterly aborning promised by colonel ashburn in  it was actually printed in that year through page  only when the needed appropriation of  was denied and not even the proverbial washington parrot trained to say to every visitor in his home what about the appropriation could have helped it appeared finally in  when major hume was still librarian but its first  pages of course contained no references to the literature of   otherwise the fourth series attempted to catch up journal articles which had appeared after january   and had been omitted beginning with volume vi of the third series various efforts at economy were made some commendable some productive of confusion in interpreting the entries these changes resulted in a space saving of one fifth so that additional material to that amount could be added and a thinner but tougher paper permitted almost twice the number of pages for a volume of the traditional size the appearance of the first volume happily coinciding with the centenary of the library was received with nothing less than enthusiasm by the medical profession of this and other countries congress had limited the edition to a thousand copies about eight hundred of which were distributed free to domestic and foreign scientific institutions the library continued to be plagued as in the past by requests for both free and sale copies which it could not furnish volumes appeared at oneor two year intervals through volume ix  k lyxose sixty five copies of volume vi  shipped to the british isles were lost by enemy action and were partially and temporarily replaced by microfilm meanwhile the difficulties of the indexcatalogue were being increased by new terminology and classification as medicine itself shifted emphasis wrote colonel jones to work with all four sets of the index catalogue as a single bibliographical tool is  difficult    since medical knowledge has changed considerably with a flow of new scientific terms and new groupings of diseases these changes and the shifting emphasis on medical research problems necessitate the constant reshaping of the bibliographical classes of the catalog so that even the homonymous terms of the four series are not always equivalent and for completely recent terms there seems to be nothing analogous in the older sets of the catalog the building problem remained in  colonel jones warned that additional accommodations would soon have to be obtained elsewhere even if a new building was immediately voted in  the seventy fifth congress passed bills authorizing a new building for the library and museum at a cost not to exceed  in the spring of  a collection of duplicates bound and unbound to the weight of approximately fifty five tons was packed into boxes and moved by truck to the army medical center for dead storage in june  the seventysixth congress appropriated  for plans for the new building in  an amendment authorized an additional million dollars for acquisition of a site this time on capitol hill plans but not details for working drawings were completed for a fitting structure near the folger library and the library of congress annex the national parks planning commission approved the fine arts commission approved but the essential funds had not been voted it was a race against time time and world war ii won emergency measures were taken in  the national archives had offered to store in limited accessibility 
the national library of medicine  inactive volumes after december   colonel jones became increasingly mindful of the dangers to which the library rarest volumes were exposed not only from improper housing in crowded conditions with more modern books but also from enemy attack on july   lieutenant thomas e keys was sent to set up in rented space at the allen memorial medical library the cleveland branch of the army medical library this installation now the history of medicine division was never intended for dead storage its thousands of books through the year  have been checklisted and then cataloged physically restored and consulted for reference service from the very beginning and accessions have been steadily added as the budget allowed later the library moved portions of its collection which had been housed in the washington auditorium to the fisheries building and the fisheries building annex across seventh street from the main library later still these were moved to tampa and escanaba halls temporary barracks structures across independence avenue gone for a time was the dream of a building on capitol hill the library had a war on its hands and as before it was ill prepared wartime conditions did permit however expansion of personnel fifty eight in washington nine in cleveland in  and some progress in departmental organization was made in the period   colonel jones was greatly assisted by the professional acumen of captain francis r st john a trained librarian hastily summoned in  from hennepin county medical society library found a fantastic situation in library hallthe place humming with activity everyone wanting journals the journals all too often successfully eluding the searchers miss helen norris was not one to take the situation casually and in the reference services efforts at improvement came early with the help of dr archibald malloch at the new york academy of medicine who called dr alan gregg and with the unceasing encouragement and support of colonel jones who was fully aware of the situation the national medical library during the year beginning june   was made the object of a survey financed by the rockefeller foundation and executed under the auspices of the american library association these pages have already made clear part of what the surveyors keyes d metcalf janet doe thomas p fleming mary louise marshall l quincy mumford and andrew d osborn found their report was published in  by which time colonel jones had already taken additional steps toward reorganization these pages have also made clear what some of their recommendations would be a new building is an absolute necessity wrote mr metcalf it is difficult to give added force to so strong a word as necessity while surgeon general barnes in  had made a similar necessity more imperative mr metcalf set before it the word absolute construction said the surveyors should begin as soon as possible after the war and should be completed within two years meanwhile colonel jones bearing the new title of director should continue the divisional lines which he had already drawn in   and should make responsible to a career librarian as far as technical administration was concerned the acquisition administrative catalog index catalogue rare books and reference and circulation divisions gone
 the library quarterly the twenty clerks who could serve as jacks of all trades emphasis in these divisions was to be rather on professional library personnel gone the prerogatives of the index catalogue section it was still to produce the index catalogue but in an editorial capacity only its existing card catalog was to be scrapped and a new one prepared by a new catalog division according to standard library practice development of a classification scheme was strongly recommended the library was urged to acquire on publication all new publications in all languages directl y relating to the science of medicine when all these recommendations had been acted on it was thought that the reference and circulation division could function admirably but above all larger and steady appropriations were needed the support of the library wrote mr metcalf is not something to be turned off and on like a faucet if the war department the report continued is not ready to supply that support year in and year out another sponsor must be found or the library cannot remain a great one so the library had examined itself and had been examined by qualified consultants the surgery both major and plastic had already been initiated john shaw billings who once performed surgery on a faltering marine hospital service would have approved new resolve   one of the most appalling revelations of the survey committee was that the acquisition of purely medical monographic and textbook material has by no means been comprehensive  and the situation with regard to periodical holdings is all too often deplorable it was estimated that only about  per cent of the medical book production of the decade of the thirties was to be found in the library and that the   current periodical titles received came to about four fifths of the number being acquired by the next largest american medical library which in total number of volumes was half the size of the army medical library out of  titles added to the list of titles indexed by the quarterly cumulative index medicus between january  and june  only  titles were in the library over a period of a decade under the successive able ministrations of scott adams joseph groesbeck and samuel lazerow a revolution took place and material poured into the library the acquisitions staff was quintupled the acquisitions budget was trebled and entries in the current serial record soared to  of which  can be described as periodicals month after month and year after year the library added an average of a hundred new serial titles monthly to its holdings an exchange program was undertaken soon the number of titles being received in exchange for the current list alone exceeded the total number of titles currently received during the survey year a mass disposal of duplicates was begun in the heydey of this program over a hundred shipments per month averaging  pieces per shipment were made war devastated libraries throughout the world were aided the nuclei of newly established medical school libraries were formed and to a lesser degree the library was enabled to fill in some of the dreadful lacunae in its own collection new methods were tried blanket orders were placed world wide originally effective this plan was largely superseded in  with the return to something like normalcy in the world
the national library of medicine  book trade by exhaustive searching and selection from over fifty national bibliographies and from other sources photographic methods were extensively employed to speed the searching process and found increasing usefulness in other areas in the midst of all this activity the library was forced to reconsider and redefine its collecting policies everything medical had once been the watchword in practice this was not a particularly helpful rule a careful and detailed statement of policy was worked out in   and revised in    not only was current collecting policy reshaped by the application of these canons but also the pruning of the old collection in accordance with them was undertaken some census material was transferred to the library of congress some basic chemistry went to the john crerar library and military manuals were turned over to the national war college out the window went arrowsmith and dr serocold and a host of mystery novels in which physicians presumably figured prominently also disposed of were a book on diseases of high altitudes which turned out to be a satire on the political situation in peru and a troubleshooter handbook on krankheiten of lead storage batteries which was found classed under electrotherapy the dust flew thick and fast and the catalogers were forced to don gloves masks and smocks as they went about their work ruth macdonald took hold of the newly organized catalog division and set about the task of bringing order out of chaos not only did the new stuff pouring in have to be coped with but the survey committee facing up to stern reality had recommended recataloging of the entire collection the state of the old catalog was disquieting typewritten cards handwritten cards library of congress cards cards clipped and pasted from the index catalogue all were jammed together in what was often a curious and baffling filing arrangement entries were sometimes equally curious as when a publication of the child study association of america was found entered under america an absolute defect of the old catalog was the absence of location symbols once the catalog was made to reveal the presence of a book it was frequently a matter of great difficulty to locate its exact whereabouts and occasional hints scrawled in pencil on the backs of the catalog cards such as third shelf behind me to the right were rarely helpful with the help of mary louise marshall of tulane a shelf classification scheme was drawn up tested revised printed and put into use new procedures were established descriptive cataloging rules were modified no longer was includes bibliographies to be used as a drop note on the assumption that this was a general characteristic of most of the books in the library size was not to be mentioned whether by fold or by height periodicals were to be cataloged under the title current at the time when titles changed the old entry was to be closed and a new entry opened with a connecting note corporate authors were to be given in the form prevalent at the time of publication as soon as a basic catalog was established personal authors were to be established on a no conflict basis in ten years of operation  titles were cataloged of which  per cent represented recataloging the new catalog was divided into name and subject sections with the subject section limited with a few exceptions to entries for works of the preceding twenty five
