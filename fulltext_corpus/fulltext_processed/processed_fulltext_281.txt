 the library quarterly public library has held this policy since before the turn of the century about two years ago the new york public library circulation department adopted a policy of letting any resident of new york state use his library card when visiting the city or issuing a new york public library card to permit regular use of the library suburban use of the large city library for reference and other purposes has been going on for years and is growing with the increased student use of public libraries the cleveland public library and the cuyahoga county public library have been leaders in a metropolitan area study and in the development of a uniform salary scale for the area libraries the enoch pratt free library is engaged in two co operative programscounty services and metropolitan maryland library service county services established by written contract in  combines into one service system all of the state county libraries metropolitan maryland library service begun in january  is a co operative program involving the seven metropolitan area counties and baltimore city and is entirely supported by federal library services and construction act funds not all the participants sign a contract but each files an annual application for funds with the division of library extension the enoch pratt free library receives compensation for its part in the reciprocal borrowing program as well as an annual payment of  to be used in strengthening the reference collections and capabilities of the library the metropolitan maryland libary service program serves as an excellent example of a co operative program between the large city library and suburban areas agreements on the method of operation availability of collections and formula for distribution of funds were made by the participating libraries on data which were incomplete and in some cases not available with no reliable predictions of the probable impact of the projected arrangements the willingness of these units to experiment with opening their services to all was based largely on a recognized need to make available to metropolitan residents all metropolitan public library resources none of these negative factors with their immediate effects were viewed as important enough to outweigh the long range advantages of metropolitan cooperation this was possible because the administrators of at least some of the libraries involved had been holding regular meetings since  to define and discuss mutual concerns and to work towards mutually advantageous solutions a climate of acceptance of metropolitan service resulted from the mutual respect and trust established by these meetings reciprocal borrowing privileges were first limited to adult books and were later extended to include children books daily truck delivery to send and return books and films from the pratt library has expedited the use of materials during the first year of operation a two week study of use patterns was made over  per cent of the books borrowed by non residents were provided by pratt the problems encountered did not require changes in services or regulations the metropolitan maryland library service program is complemented by the county services program under the latter the counties are linked by teletype thus providing rapid com maryland state department of education division of library extension    where the action is     maryland school bulletin september   ibid
viewpoint of the suburban library  munication pratt library staff book reviews are transmitted to all county libraries and ambiguous interlibrary loan requests can be clarified through this communication system in spite of these and other examples of co operation which might be listed the degree of co operation between the historic resource center and the suburbs is still minimal when measured against the need as seen from the suburbs what is the suburban librarian attitude toward the large city library in an effort to sample the viewpoint from the suburban libraries letters were written to thirty suburban librarians replies were received from twenty they were asked whether in their opinion the large city library is fulfilling its responsibilities how the proximity of the library affects their libraries policies and finally what they see as the future relationship between the suburban libraries and the large city library statistical tabulation of an informal survey of such a small sample is not feasible but the attitudes of the suburban librarians can be detected though they vary considerably even within the same metropolitan area with very few exceptions these suburban librarians recognize their dependence on the large city library and acknowledge the effect of the proximity of its collection on their book selection policies one exception states policies that govern my library are not in any way influenced by the proximity of the metropolitan library we are developing our own resources as though this library were the only resource available to the community this of course is only to insure the highest ideals in practice we borrow heavily from the state library on the other hand most replies relating to the feeling of dependence were similar to one suburban librarian comments while it is tempting to take the large city library for granted its very existence makes the suburban librarian job easier it is not necessary to stock expensive and infrequently used materials he can concentrate on the more popular and put more money in a circulating collection than would otherwise be possible another stated i feel very strongly that we too little appreciate the value of a metropolitan library most suburban librarians acknowledge with gratitude the co operative efforts already in existence our principal call is for interloan of books we have had excellent co operation states one children librarian meetings have been open to suburban librarians for years writes another one librarian is grateful for being able to attend the city library book discussion meetings and to seek the advice of its subject specialists after giving credit where due however the suburban librarians strongly voice the opinion that the large city library is not fulfilling its responsibilities as they see them from the suburbs the problems as seen from the suburbs naturally vary among metropolitan areas while one metropolitan library is praised for excellent co operation in interloan of materials another is accused of the lack of co operation on the basic idea of exchange of materials which the suburban librarian calls the shame of our metropolitan area one nonmaryland suburban librarian does not think any of the metropolitan public libraries except for enoch pratt are fulfilling their professional library responsibilities to the metropolitan area
 the library quarterly a few large libraries were subjected to severe criticism an example from one suburb should be enough before the large city library can play any positive role in relation to suburban libraries it must itself become a progressive modern institution with an enlightened book selection policy truly superior resources and a determination to meet the needs of its patrons the suburban librarian does not ignore his own responsibilities one in criticizing the metropolitan library sums up by writing who to blameours collectively another shares the blame between suburb and large city equally often suburban librarians are too involved in a jealous competitive or a resentful snubbed attitude towards the big city library and are unable to look for help towards a more cooperative relationship big city libraries are just as much to blame most of them have very great shortcomings the librarians tend to be defensive they do not feel in a position to lead and they don want to be asked to leadership was the characteristic most frequently stated as lacking in big city librarians could this be a change in attitude did the suburban librarian of ten or twenty years ago look to the large city library for leadership one correspondent pointed out attempts on the part of the city library to offer leadership in the  and  the attempts were not very welcome at that time the suburban librarian now seeks leadership from the metropolitan library in several ways he wants the city library to be a cultural force commanding the respect of the citizenry at large a good example a model for suburban library boards he wants the large library to build better materials collections and share them by serving the patron through the suburban library interloan was described variously as a moral obligation and a professional responsibility he admits interloan of books in a metropolitan situation is largely a one way matter all the suburban librarians who answered agree that the metropolitan library should be reimbursed for the cost of such sharing but there is justifiable concern whether anyone including the big city librarian knows what the costs actually are state and federal funds were the only sources of funds mentioned to meet the costs next to the desire for leadership from the city library the suburban librarians most frequently mention the desperate need for communication one summed it up it is important that both the suburban librarian and the director of the central library be willing to communicate with each other to sit down and talk things over and not be inaccessible one to the other a recent study of new york state library systems draws attention to some of the problems facing the large city libraries for the most part one sees these city libraries hard pressed to maintain traditional services at a sound level in the face of limited funds rising costs unstable community conditions the increasing scope of reader interests and of materials being published and the rising demands of a high school and college group that lacks adequate resources within their own institutions fresh approaches and new programs whether for the underprivileged or for a growing cultural elite or for the business community are few and far between  state education department division of evaluation emerging library systems the   evaluation of the new york state public library systems albany university of the state of new york  p x 
viewpoint of the suburban library  the professional staff shortage can be added to this already formidable list of problems except for the fact that many problems are similar though on a much larger scale to those facing suburban libraries it is doubtful that suburban librarians are aware of their pervasiveness in large city library operations conceivably size may be confused in the minds of some with affluence there is evidence however of an attempt by the suburban librarians to understand the problems of the large city library two believed their city libraries had so many problems that they probably are not interested in acquiring any more    by extending service one perceptive suburban librarian wrote i think the questions involved are rather difficult for either the city or suburban librarian to answer if neither has had experience in both libraries not all the problems of the city library are known to the suburban librarian and vice versa communication between the two would go far toward better understanding on the part of both the suburban librarians saw hope for better relationships with the large city library in the future although most of their ideas are not original some may bear repeating cooperation according to one suburbanite will have to become the by word a metropolitan area wide borrower card an efficient and practical communication system union lists book catalogs daily delivery centralized processing advice of big city library specialists the large city library pioneering in projects and sharing experience and knowledge are among those mentioned financing such projects by state rather than federal funds seemed more likely to the suburban librarian there is a wide variation of interlibrary loan policies among the large city libraries some libraries are very liberal others may be liberal to distant borrowing libraries but refuse this service to nearby suburban libraries chicago for example will lend to libraries only beyond a fifty mile radius a study of new york state library systems indicates interlibrary loan to be the most successful device for extending physical accessibility of materials in the northern part of the state alone interlibrary loans increased  per cent in seven years very few libraries other than strong central libraries drew more than  per cent of their users from beyond a ten mile radius lack of staff skills inadequate bibliographic tools and the long interval between request and receipt are problems involved in interlibrary loan which have so far defied solution the new york study indicates that getting to the reader the precise materials he needs is the problem that has received the least attention martin and bowler in their california study indicate the problem of mounting demand on the few strong collections and suggest the channeling of requests through systems headquarters before forwarding them to the city library st john while admitting an accurate determination has been impossible suggests that the cost of an interlibrary loan may range from  to  obviously the interlibrary loan problem is only one of many which affect service to residents of metropolitan ibid  lowell a martin and roberta bowler public library service equal to the challenge of calif ornia a report to the state librarian sacramento california state library  emerging library systems op cit see n  above p vi

viewpoint of the suburban library  aware of their interdependence with the city library the creation of federated suburban systems is developing leadership and the ability of suburbia to speak through a few representative leaders a dialogue between the suburban library and the historic reference library is now possible on the other hand the large city library with its users migrating to the suburbs and its tax base eroded will find it increasingly necessary to take part in the dialogue the need for concentrated federal and state financial support of the historic resource center is now at hand suburban backing of adequate support will be required the suburbs and the city have a vital part to play in library service of the future they are now more equal the suburban systems will not be strong enough to stand alone the large city library is no longer strong enough to do without the help of the suburban systems in recognizing their interdependence they can work together more effectively state libraries too are beginning to recognize the need for co ordinated effort in metropolitan area service lowell martin suggests a statewide library structure of five related levels of service and interlibrary use of resources along with abolishing the limitations on use imposed by governmental jurisdictions included in the new york illinois pennsylvania and massachusetts system organizations are attempts to solve some of these problems on a statewide basis it is apparent that the problems of metropolitan areas deserve top priority at the present stage of public library development to provide a beginning to a co ordinated approach the administrator of each large city library should provide the leadership that the suburban librarians apparently now seek regularly scheduled meetings called by the large city library with representatives of the suburban libraries system heads where they exist would provide a beginning to the establishment of communications with a consequent improvement in understanding each other problems together they can form a powerful group in lobbying and otherwise convincing state governments of the seriousness of metropolitan area library problems and their solutions federal state or foundation funds should be sought to finance a research and development staff to work with and for the co ordinating group although many state plans for use of lsca funds include funds for studies and research there is little evidence that they are being used on metropolitan area problems conant suggests that highly competent research and management teams be established by groups of co operating libraries among the functions of these teams would be the proposing of network library systems intergovernmental agreements and other arrangements among autonomous libraries across jurisdictional and functional lines perhaps each large city library could concentrate its research on a different set of metropolitan library problems the findings shared with due regard for area differences stalley has said if private corporations spend five to eight percent of their funds for research and development what should government and public service agencies spend when the endeavor is not a material product  ralph w conant sociological and institutional changes in american life their implications for the library ala bulletin may  
 the library quarterly but human growth and development as complicated and difficult an end to pursue as is imaginable the suburban librarian view of the large city library differs as much as the level of suburban library service suburbia includes librarians who have thought little about the relationship as well as some who have some grasp of the problems besetting the large city library suburban librarians are themselves facing problems that in their view require the assistance of their large neighbor suburban librarians if they were not ready in the past are now impatient to get on with the job of working with the big city librarian toward realistically solving the problems of co ordinated service greenaway admits that although much of the state leadership exists in the local library yet too often the city library is too independent and not sufficiently cooperative in solving statewide problems this paper may appropriately conclude with two quotations from the recent evaluation of the new york state public library systems barriers to further progress in cooperation and coordination fall into three major categories  those which are a manifestation of some aspect of unwillingness to subordinate any segment of one own library operation or library type to a larger authority or cause  the complexity and difficulty of knowing precisely where and how to move into the actual job and  money in all of these areas statewide planning leadership and support are essential a bold and imaginative plan enlists support if a single trend stands out most clearly as a development of present times it is probably the condition which someone has characterized as calculated interdependence no agency or individual operates alone or independently any longer the keynote of social progress lies in fact in successfully relating individual efforts to mutual or overlapping interests nor is it enough to depend on the formal and casual cooperation of the past based on courtesy and goodwill courtesy and goodwill are no less precious qualities than they have ever been but the institutional cooperation of today must be systematic organized and based on the larger interests of society in a public service endeavor such as public libraries this is not only a moral dictum it is a form of enlightened self interest and the key to survival  marshall stalley the implications of urbanization for education in problems of library services in metropolitan areas report of a seminar directed by dorothy bendix philadelphia drexel press  p   greenaway op cit see n  above p  merging library systems op cit see n  above p xii   ibid p xii
