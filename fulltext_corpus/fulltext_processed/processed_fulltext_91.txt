deans rank indicators of effectiveness for schools of library and information studies rebecca watson boone and dartene weingand this article identifies indicators of effectiveness that deans of schools with american library association ala accredited programs believe are essential important or not important to know about a school of library and information studies ljs in order to evaluate it a previous article by the same authors focused on views that members of four constituent groups of lis schools hold about the same indicators comparing deans with the constituent groups there is  percent agreement between deans and members of ala committee on accreditation coa over which indicators of effectiveness belong in each of the three designated categories there is less agreement between deans and senior academic administrators  percent alumni  percent and employers  percent overall deans focus heavily on administrative faculty and resource issues in  the authors used the alise research award to support a study of indicators and dimensions of effectiveness of schools with ala accredited programs the objectives of the study were  to identify indicators and dimensions of effectiveness that are descriptive of ala accredited lis programs and that are believed by the schools constituents to be useful in evaluating schools effectiveness  to ascertain the similarities and differences in the concepts and indicators underlying lis school evaluations across constituencies and   to see if the results suggest avenues for strengthening current schools as well as for viewing the future of schools of library and information studies slis for the purpose of that study the four constituent groups were identified as members of coa senior academic administrators alumniae hereafter alums and employers of alums specifically coa participants were members and officers from   respondents from the other three constituencies were related to participating lis schools senior academic administrators were represented by each institution president chief academic officer graduate school head chief financial officer and the officer to whom the head of the slis reported employ volume  number

 journal of education for library and information science participants were asked to rate each indicatorstatement by circling the number that reflects your opinion additional comments were invited participants were instructed that they were not rating a particular lis school the deans of participating schools received the same questionnaire form and instructions as those sent to participants from the four constituent groups eligible programs and questionnaire response the fifty nine ala accredited programs comprised the population programs were excluded if they were experiencing some form of change such as closure restructuring or extraordinary review or were without a permanent dean a few schools declined to participate others did not respond in time thirty five schools participated in the overall slis effectiveness study deans from twenty nine of those schools also participated  percent response the deans responses form the substance of this article analysis the likert scale for each indicator had three clusters   and  equated with the phrase not important to know   with important to know and   and  with essential to know although the data is ordinal it is common for likert scale means to be calculated so responses can be ranked means for deans responses ranged from a low of  to a high of  on the   scale the spss program that calculated means also ran one way anovas including scheffe tests of statistical difference no statistical inference is intended in the discussion that follows however the means are used to denote the importance deans give to each of the seventy indicators and to the particular placement of indicators within each of the three categories the authors are satisfied that the means reflect the preference deans have for each indicator as a measure of the effectiveness of schools of library and information studies findings the seventy indicator statements cluster into the following eight inductively derived groups administration alumsemployment continuing education curriculum faculty recruitment resources and students the authors used the constant comparative method of grounded theory to derive the groups comparison between the deans ranking and those of the four constituent groups is made throughout the text the wording of each indicator appendix is incorporated into the text where appropriate rather than being continuously offset by quotation marks essential to know deans place twenty two indicators of effectiveness in this category they focus on administrative and faculty issues as being most crucial to know about schools of library and information studies they place secondary emphasis on curricular alum and employment matters table  shows those indicators comprising the first septile top ten the indicators are listed in descending order of mean value from  to  asterisks identify indicators that all four constituent groups eg coa administrators alums employers also rank among their top ten deans clearly concern themselves volume  number
