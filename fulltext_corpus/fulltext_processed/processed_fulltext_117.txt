 journal of education for library and information science to  percent not an uncommon solution without carefully considering the causes of the disparity is counterproductive and could more likely elicit resentment from those groups who lost the material budget to reallocation scenario two minority recruitment who should be hired for a branch public library situated in a predominantly african american community minority recruitment is probably the most widely proposed solution to promote diversity many employers assume that it best to have a minority community served by one of its own based on that logic most would suggest that it better to hire an africanamerican librarian to serve a predominantly african american community this however sometimes creates a problem of racial and social segregation students must be made aware that increasing the number of minority librarians and integrating minority culture and majority culture are two separate though closely related goals one objective will not succeed without efforts to achieve the other the issue here is to find the best way to increase minority recruitment and at the same time integrate minority and majority groups to hire minority workers to serve the minority community although it may help improve minority recruitment does not in itself promote diversity and cultural integration scenario three stereotypes a small group of black students seem to always come to the library together gather in a corner talk and giggle for more than an hour before leaving together should the librarian find out what they are doing and keep an eye on them to make sure that they are not plotting something bad when this scenario was read in the classroom most students recognized it as blatant discrimination immediately yet anecdotes exist where library security guards are called upon to deal with groups of people with whom the librarian feels uncomfortable groups that cause the librarian discomfort include people of different characteristics who are at times perceived as problem patrons they may be teenagers africanamericans foreign students homeless mothers with young children or elderly students need to be aware that lack of understanding is often the cause of the fear that is the primary cause of discrimination they need to be encouraged to think of all possible causes of such fear and to develop strategies for understanding the needs of the unfamiliar groups and for overcoming their own discomfort an equally important issue in this scenario is the concept of stereotyping and some common stereotypes of specific racial groups the use of blacks in this scenario provides an opportunity for students to discuss recent studies on social bias that reinforce racial stereotypes such as the study done by shanto iyengar a professor at ucla on how bias in television crime reports affect the viewers stereotypes of africanamericans scenario four the english only policy the bibliographic instruction librarian was told he violated the english only policy by speaking korean during his lunch break to some new korean foreign students in an effort to help them become oriented to the new academic environment at least twentytwo states in the us volume  number 
the vsbe college  have official language laws defining english as the official language of the state the republican congress of  also proposed and debated several english only bills although none were passed when legislated the englishonly law declares english as the official language and the language mandated in government related business the restrictive nature of the law varies from one state to another states with more restrictive laws may prohibit the use of non english languages in election ballots driver license testing courtroom proceedings and even stipulate a penalty for governmental employees who conduct official business in languages other than english the law could further restrict or prohibit public funding for bilingual studies at schools and in adult literacy programs the american library association has at times opposed the english only legislation especially when public funding for bilingual and literacy education is affected a library employee in a state with an english only law must be aware of the law and the limits of the law she must learn to identify and deal with potential abuses of the law and be protective of her own rights in the workplace in serving users of different languages and cultures scenario five affirmative action librarian rumor has it that the new black librarian was hired as the result of pressure from the central office to fill the affirmative action quota several of your colleagues have commented that he graduated from clark atlanta doesn speak standard english is not familiar with the library collection and doesn seem very friendly to the users after decades of implementation affirmative action policy is the target of frequent attacks around the country in the s the court recently ruled against the use of race as a criterion in university admissions in texas the board of regents of the university of california uc dismantled the use of affirmative action policies for the uc systems when implemented the passage of proposition  in california will prohibit the state government from using race and gender in awarding funding and contracts critics often cite quotas and race preferences in the workplace as the evils of affirmative action and demand the return of merit based evaluation as the sole method of making decisions in hiring and promoting supporters of affirmative action cite the historical injustice and social disparity of minority groups as evidence of the continuing need for affirmative action amidst the polarized political and social debates it is essential for students to discuss the historical development implementation and abuses of the policy within the past few decades and some fundamental concepts related to affirmative action including the basic notion of equal opportunity the quantitative versus qualitative ability evaluation the social and cultural qualifications in recruitment and the issue of retention efforts following recruitment furthermore this scenario also illustrates how the lack of understanding of the policy could arouse public prejudice against certain groups in the workplace scenario six the immigrant accent a user complained that ignorant person who barely spoke english should not be at the reference desk and should go back to where she came from because the reference librarian told him fall
