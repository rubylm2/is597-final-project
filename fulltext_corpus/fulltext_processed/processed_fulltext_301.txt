let s get the most out of comprehensive examinations edmund r arnold and robert t bottle our once and docile student on examination comprehensive though circumspect and prudent has objections most extensive  b e z podpisi the past few years have witnessed the growth of student power  the rise of student demands for relevance and perhaps more important an active voice in determining the nature and scope of the curriculum and in its administration library schools though somewhat behind the trend are still no strangers to this phenomenon which during the past year has produced stormy sessions at the american library association annual meeting and at those of several state and other associations it is not our purpose here to treat all aspects of the problem but rather to focus attention upon one feature of many accredited library school curricula which is beginning to receive more concerted attention by students not a few brickbat broadsides have been leveled at the comprehensive examination its concept and its administration in just over half of our accredited library schools a comprehensive examination is used as a final test of fitness for the library profession  a final this article was prepared while arnold and bottle were at the school of library science at syracuse university where both served on the school committee on comprehensive examinations arnold is now director of library services at cornell college mount vemon iowa and bottle is a lecturer at the university of bradford in england ill
journal of education for librarianship test which in some cases has all but washed out otherwise highly regarded students recently one bright student appended a brief essay to an examination paper which incidentally was passed with flying colors in which the principle of the examination was challenged and a charge of insult to the student was levelled surely it was felt such a test upon which so much is based is unfair for to be admitted to the examination the student must have passed satisfactorily all courses and must have maintained at least a certain minimum grade average and what of those highly regarded students who fail  their degree is postponed at best never awarded at the worst and they may be deprived of a position for which they possess all other qualifications simply because they did not clear that one last hurdle die comprehensive examination  of what these are serious charges to some extent they may be justified certainly they are worthy of consideration this paper then will essay a commentary on the comprehensive examination in which examinations in general their concept their purpose and their ever present reality will be discussed to some extent and to propose some measures for improving the drafting and administration of comprehensive examinations for the betterment of librarianship as a whole what is an examination essentially it is a process of careful scrutiny an investigation an inspection or more properly an assay usually the term is associated with some set of questions written andor oral to which a student must supply a set of satisfactory answers as such they may be referred to as examinations tests quizzes and possibly other fond epithets in a larger sense however it may well be said that all of us are daily undergoing examinations the grades for which are recorded in an infinite variety of ways a poor grade for the librarian may be the angry user put off by an apparent lack of concern for his problem a good grade may be the light in a child eyes as he or she is introduced to a fascinating new idea or the firm commitment of the mayor or president of the board to increased support of the library program as the result of a fine presentation of purpose goals and needs the promotion received or not the raise in pay or lack of it are to all practical purposes grades received on a long series of daily comprehensive examinations  comprehensive because in each case decisions are made based upon the whole of what one has done  or failed to do this is not to say that these examinations are objective or even ac
comprehensive examinations curate or valid measures of achievement they exist however and are quite likely to remain as long as productivity and competence are requirements of our economic and social life they exist as a continuum of life measures with points for and against accumulating daily with the ratios of credits and debits being assessed in a multitude of ways by a multitude of persons for a multitude of reasons the problem then would seem to be less a question whether there should be such a thing as a comprehensive examination in library schools or anywhere else for that matter than it is a question of whether a comprehensive examinations as they now exist measure what they are supposed to measure b whether such an examination can serve as a final test of a person fitness for the profession and c if the answer to b is yes  how it might be well at this point to consider the present status of the comprehensive examination as it exists in the ala accredited schools in the fall of  we wrote to the dean or chairman of each of the ala accredited schools of library science in the united states requesting copies of their latest catalog and any statements of policy concerning comprehensive examinations and theses information was obtained from  of the  us schools and this is summarized in table i where a further breakdown by region is given replies were also received from three canadian schools only one of which offered a master degree and none of which required a comprehensive examination we did not include these three in the final tabulation because of the difficulty of determining the equivalence of their programs to those on the south side of the border nor did we include the two non responding schools because although their catalogs were subsequently examined no definite statments either way concerning comprehensive examinations could be discerned an impression gained from perusal of our information is that while  per cent of the schools offer a thesis option such option is not actively encouraged in effect then  per cent of our respondents require a comprehensive examination thus tacitly agreeing that this is a legitimate final test  at least up to this point the percentage of the top ten schools requiring comprehensive examinations however did not differ significantly from the over all figure these top ten were somewhat arbitrarily determined from an informal survey of opinion of nine syracuse university library school faculty some regional variations are apparent for example the northeast appears less stringent in this requirement than the average

comprehensive examinations would not be inconsistent with our earlier comment on the ever present reality of examinations yet there would seem to be a virtue in looking closely at what we are doing and to state clearly legitimate reasons why so that we may clearly understand the purpose to be served by this measurement and that we may develop criteria both for what needs to be measured and for testing the test itself comprehensive examinations are not popular with students we don need a dale carnegie to tell us this but perhaps we do need to spell out to students as they enter library school a rationale for comprehensive examinations the comprehensive examination should not be regarded as the final hurdle in an obstacle race but rather as a touchstone the assaying qualities of which will impel the student to integrate into a unified whole the ideas and information which he acquires whilst making up that patchwork quilt of courses which we call his program too often students particularly the part time student or dilletante and there are indeed many of the latter will take courses on a catch as catch can basis regarding each course as a purchase for which they receive a trading stamp when their card is filled with trading stamps they expect to graduate this is no new analogy as witness the rather critical view of american education for librarianship taken by roy b stokes in his article the trading stamp mentality  if the comprehensive examination were abolished without being replaced by some other integrative touchstone it would in our opinion only strengthen this view of american library education as we remarked earlier the basic question is do our comprehensive examinations as they now exist measure what we think they do to this question we have no answer in those schools presently involved in reassessment it would appear that this question or a similar question has already been asked in order to answer the question one must first ask  what needs to be known what is the ratio of specific knowledge to integrative process which we ought to expect and how much we ought also to ask which elements can we quantify and for which elements must we rely on our intuition for evaluation  we have no answers here  only questions but these are some of the questions which need to be asked locally regionally and nationally and this despite our fundamental belief that the comprehensive examination in concept is legitimate and in practice can contribute to the total educational development of the student and even further to serve as an instrument for the betterment of librarianship as a whole can  should  such an examination serve as a final check on a person fitness before sending 
journal of education for librarianship him into the field is there really any other way stokes view has already been mentioned but consider another analogy which we will call the magpie syndrome how else can we diagnose whether a student is a magpie who has collected various bright and sundry things with which he can do nothing or whether having collected his courses the student has welded these into a useful functioning tool we do not presume here either to specify how such examination can be made to measure what needs to be measured such a specification can only arise out of the answers to the other questions we do however see a way in which these examinations can be used to improve the standards of librarianship and library education as well as serving as an integrating educational experience then the comprehensive examination could also be used to raise and unify the standards of american library schools in the united kingdom external examiners are used to insure uniformity of standards between various universities these examiners serving at the request of the department not only provide authoritative judgment unbiased by local considerations but also stand as public evidence that such standards are so upheld the british practice is for a department to appoint one or more professors from other universities who are authorities in different branches of the subject and who read the draft examinations and normally have the power to change up to two questions on each after the examinations have been set and have been marked by the regular faculty the external examiners visit the university and give oral examinations to a sample of the students normally the students who are interviewed are on the borderline between a first second or third class honours degree these divisions are analogous to an a or a b or a c over all average this procedure is we feel sure relevant for the current scene in american library schools we would suggest that two external examiners be appointed by each school holding comprehensive examinations perhaps one examiner would represent the information sciences and the other the schoolpublic library and other more traditional library activities since it was long ago decided that four years was an optimum period for a president to remain in office without fear of dismissal these external examiners should we feel be placed on four year contracts and like the president could be re elected by the faculty a finite number of times in cases where a faculty had regretted their choice maybe they could get some advice of impeachment procedure from the local john birch society the widespread use of senior library science faculty in this way would we feel very quickly lead to
