the library quarterly volume vii july  number  tomorrow harry miller lydenberg is tomorrow more important than today how much control have we over either how are both affected by yesterday how much ought we to think about each do librarians differ in this respect from the rest of the world is an occasional glance at the past a futile worship of antiquarianism all fair enough as questions but certainly not for final decision here or now they may however serve to suggest that dreaming about the future is not necessarily wasteful and that a prudent man frequently checks yesterday with today for a view of tomorrow readers every librarian will agree are now much keener for help in social and technical problems than they were a generation ago dogmatic theology dominant until the fifties has lost its rank how long before our children will look at our presentday interest in social and economic theory and practice with the same detachment we now give to studies of the pelagian or sabellian heresies our books have had much the same shapes forms almost the same sizes for five hundred years how long before they i part of a paper on library development given before the harvard library club february   
 the library quarterly change radically as to method of manufacture form size use i am not daring enough to fix that date but i am sure it will face us sooner or later sure that the librarian today cannot afford to neglect thinking about the librarian of yesterday or tomorrow library work is a trilogy of people books equipment and the people in the book world divide themselves again into the three groups of author reader librarian the latter serving as connecting agent the author is not in question here he will undoubtedly write books in the future as he has in the past partly because he cannot help it partly because his friends or his publishers implying there of course no antagonistic grouping urge him the reader is certainly playing a larger part in the interest of the librarian now than he has in the past an attention is today given to his needs both in the writing and in the manufacturing of books far beyond that of a generation ago no doubt his needs were recognized in those earlier years perhaps the chief change today is that expression of those needs has become more vocal more systematically set forth previous to dean william s gray reading interests and habits of adults published in  the principal studies on the subject of reading interests had been carried on by teachers investigating the reading habits of students in elementary and high schools in dean gray very full bibliography on the subject he notes one study reading tastes of high school pupils carried out in i after i various articles appeared in library journals and other periodicals on such subjects as changing fashions in dime novel substitutes or what do you read but by far the greatest research continued to be done in the field of student reading until the advent of e l thorndike book on adult learning i followed by gray study already mentioned an article by mrs helen t steinbarger on reading interest studies appearing in the booklist of the american library association for july i summarizes the work done since i the interest in readable books started in i with the li
tomorrow  brarians discussing the need for humanized literature libraries and adult education possibly instigated by j h robinson humanizing of knowledge which was published in i miss felsenthal list of readable books in many subjects was published in  since then mr chancellor miss tompkins and dr bryson have written various articles on the subject and finally dean gray book what makes a book readable  reports the findings of his scientific study of objective methods of evaluating the readability of books remember the sweep and scope of the reading with a purpose series published by the american library association consider too the time and thought the school men have given to investigation of reading ability to methods of improvement for children in school and for adults with school long behind them studies of reading ability have covered whole communities special groups and adult education classes half adozen libraries in various parts of the country have by observation by questionnaire and by intensive study sought to learn why readers come to the library for what purpose their reading was done what success they had what difficulties they encountered there is no doubt that the reader is being observed and studied more carefully now than ever before for the librarian too the past generation has unquestionably seen a marked change in point of view there is today an emphasis on the need of training that was felt by comparatively few forty years ago the growth of library schools needs no comment here and there a prejudice against them still may linger a glance askance still be their normal reception but that will pass we see today an increasing fear of intrusting the library field to untrained workers this changed point of view has unquestionably developed from the profession itself rather than from outside pressure it is an appreciation of the opportunity nay the necessity felt by the people who do the work there is no doubt as to its future what form it will take however offers another opportunity for thought and speculation we all have seen the school men show how keenly they feel the necessity for lessening the atten
 the library quarterly tion to mere technique the necessity for emphasizing the study of broader principles specialization in training and in later work has made itself evident in our calling quite as much as in the fields of medicine law or engineering the benefits have been equally great and the dangers are equally threatening one of the problems for the next generation of librarians and for those responsible for library schools will unquestionably be how to provide trained people capable of handling specific problems of library work and possessed at the same time of foundations wide enough and inspirations comprehensive enough to keep them from limiting their horizons to the particular tasks before them faced with such a problem the medical world developed the hospital intern some of us have come to feel that a similar system is called for in the library field giving the man who has had his training in the schoolroom and in the laboratory some means of tasting testing trying various phases of library work before he finally settles down to cultivation of the particular field he finds most responsive to his particular capabilities the hand of the government or organized society has within the memory of each of us come to touch the librarian in a more intimate fashion than would have been dreamed of not so long ago new york has joined wisconsin and north carolina and other states in requiring certification for librarians in posts paid from public funds massachusetts i believe has talked about this though no decision has been reached emergency or workrelief projects recently have sent thousands of workers into library circles the national association of librarians is going through the stress and strain of deciding whether it ought to stand by its resolution adopted a year or two ago recommending increased attention to library service by the federal government it makes little difference whether we approve of or deplore this tendency tomorrow will undoubtedly see more of it than did yesterday just how much more and just what the effects are to be on the body politic and on the librarian are questions that students of political science and government can answer
tomorrow  with more accuracy and finality than i but of the fact there certainly can be no question library equipment the tendency today in design of library buildings seems to indicate an increasing emphasis on the desirability of a central storage space with special reading rooms and study rooms arranged around it in this as in most other human affairs the pendulum will probably swing to and fro giving us a chance now and then to see library buildings favor the h form shift to interior courts or a central stack core or swing to something totally different there is nothing ultimate of course in the precise form of the building it must be adapted to the needs of the community it serves and the region that uses it there is no doubt however that all our future buildings will have a control of air and light far beyond our fondest dreams physical control of the air to say nothing of sound will certainly follow in the library as it develops in the commercial and industrial world there will undoubtedly be more attention to the needs of the staff more restrooms recreation facilities locker space lunchrooms etcall so obvious as to call for nothing more than mention the library in larger centers must unquestionably face an increase in the mechanical handling of books and readers regretfully leaving to the smaller institutions the personal contact the fortunate librarian in such a post is able to make between book and reader the control of books on the shelves in the control of books on the shelves it is safe to say that the problems of classification will probably loom as less important in principle than they did a generation ago looking backward we recall the missionary zeal the crusading eloquence with which the dewey decimal system the cutter expansive alphabetical system the systems brought forward by schwartz in new york and perkins in san francisco all had their claims and advantages proclaimed on every occasion that offered as a practical matter the problems of classification as a sys
 the library quarterly tem have been simplified by the increasing use of the cards printed by the library of congress all supplied with library of congress classification and many with dc marks the tendency with all of us probably will be to work toward broader groupings more elastic divisions more ready recognition that we are part of a rapidly changing world more recognition that ultimate reliance must be made on the staff and the catalog and with mention of the catalog we have what is one of the most important problems facing the new generation the younger people let us hope they will solve it in more satisfactory fashion than we have done just see where we are today english french and german national libraries are all demonstrating their belief in the desirability not to say finality of the author record in form of the printed volume the vatican library to be sure has given unqualified adherence to the card catalog as a satisfactory mechanism here in this country the printed catalog in book form now is almost a museum specimen and yet none of us can fail to pay tribute to the skill the sympathy the scholarship the understanding displayed by such men as charles ammi cutter in his boston athenaeum catalog and by the compilers of the long series of catalogs issued by the boston public library the peabody catalog in baltimore the surgeon general catalog from washington and the annotated catalog of the carnegie library of pittsburgh the past forty years however have seen us all swing unquestionably into the field of the card catalog when we consider the millions of cards that are now stored away in washington we see the problem that has been created for the trained or the untrained reader who works with the catalog of a large collection trying to learn what the library has on such a subject as the world war or aviation or philosophy anything you please the card catalog is admirable for keeping its information up to date in a form readily used if the reader has accurate knowledge of the precise title or the precise phase of the subject he is looking for the latter side of the problem however is complicated by the fact that he must be sure his definition of his phase is the same as that of the maker of the catalog the reader has the
tomorrow  difficulty of fingering large masses of cards the librarian has the difficulty of either keeping these cards clean or reprinting them when worn and soiled the card catalog is unquestionably elastic flexible a devourer of space and of time in consultation it escapes the manufacturing costs of the printed catalog but it is more expensive to adminster some of us have felt that if large libraries retain the card catalog they will sooner or later have to divide it into groups for the average or unsophisticated reader with simple demands and separate groups for the man making a comprehensive survey of a whole category or faculty to a certain extent we do this now of course for example when we arrange our subject cards by date of publication or date of composition putting into a separate group all books before i or i the reader with any experience in the use of a large card catalog today must frequently realize that he can get best results by referring first to printed catalogs bibliographies or some other similar forms of aid and supplementing this preliminary delving by his fingering of the cards perhaps we may be coming to a period when our large collections will be forced to adopt the printing of author catalogs cumulated from time to time and supplemented by subject guides covering limited fields and limited periods of time to a certain extent the harvard and boston public library bulletins of a generation ago offered an encouraging solution to this cataloging problem harvard has substituted the charming harvard library notes for the bulletin and the boston public library bulletin confines itself today to the listing of new books with comments on and reviews of some of the more striking titles in connection with this cataloging problem the growth of recognition of the necessity for increased indexing and abstracting of periodicals is noteworthy in  there were about twenty printed indexes of periodicals available in the whole field of western scholarship today forty years later we have between two hundred and three hundred of which we certainly can count from seventy five to one hundred as of major importance
 the library quarterly to us it is instructive to see the recognition of the importance of this tool paid by american librarians and their early emergence in the field fortschritie der physik began in i the chemisches centralblatt in i o and the zoological record in i it was in is however that william frederick poole first introduced his index to the public and work on that had really begun four or five years earlier it was in  that dr john shaw billings began in washington his index medicus bringing to fruition a task which he like poole had begun several years earlier the comparatively recent growth of union lists of periodicals government serials and newspapers and the continued efforts to increase co operative cataloging are worth remarking printed indexes to the contents of books and periodicals have grown so strikingly in the last generation or two that we are sure their multiplication and development will continue the question of research and the publication of its results is causing concern among producing investigators as well as among librarians sometimes it looks as though a monster machine had been roused or created strong and powerful when properly controlled but with an inherent or implied threat if the grasp on the steering wheel or the pressure on the feed valve shows weakness or hesitation like goethe zauberlehrling when he forgot the word of control it is certainly beyond the power of the average man today to give attention to the mass published in his own specialty saying nothing about related and cognate but somewhat distant fields is he to throw his hands up in despair or is some new mechanism to be developed many graduate students are delving deep the stream of periodicals and journals and series and studies sweeps on with ever growing volume and force the injunction is constantly produce produce industry rejoices in the research bureaus set up for many phases of scientific investigation from electric communication and cellulose utilization to poultry oils and butter fats academic and industrial research is glimpsing how much duplication is evident harmless even useful when followed primarily as gymnastic exercise wasteful of time and
tomorrow  effort when two strive for the same results each ignorant thatthe other is in the field industry to be sure occasionally looks at all this research activity as a race with a crown for the victor at the goal warning the participant however to train in secret and say nothing until the patent shall be granted or the paper published perhaps the tendency today is toward more co operation more friendly rivalry less stealthy cultivation of trade or professional secret attitude than was common a few years past common sense tells us that sooner or later the necessity for a clearinghouse for information about these projects will be recognized a projector may stake out a claim proof against the world if he files notice at some central point and shows evidence of reasonable acitivity in working that claim it will fall back into the public domain after a certain period unless he demonstrates that he is actually trying to do something worth while so too it will become increasingly necessary that the results already attained in a given subject be set forth by a trained and competent surveyor or timber cruiser before the investigator begins work in the field or laboratory similar surveys and evaluations must follow at convenient or helpful intervals this is being done in some libraries today by the library staff itself or by assistants trained in library methods and paid for by an outside agency tomorrow will undoubtedly see more of this kind of work than yesterday or today there is no question on that point except as to details the end and the aim are as plain as a pikestaff as certain as summer another phase of the catalog problem is its cost what does a library spend on its catalog records a tenth a quarter a half of the salary allotment what ought it to spend answers to the first questions are a simple matter of arithmetic to settle the last one will call for more time and thought than have hitherto been given by any librarian i know the question deserves more study and undoubtedly will receive it another change in our point of view as compared with that of the past generation is the increased attention paid to the gathering and preserving of ephemeral material pamphlets
 the library quarterly have always been with us broadsides too it is almost a certainty that the librarian of tomorrow in a research collection will be struggling with his pamphlets his broadsides his leaflets to a degree his predecessors never approached treating the increasing volume of print this all means undoubtedly that the book stock will normally continue to double every twenty years in the usual university or research library for the circulation collection the problem is less acute because of wear and tear for the research collection there may perhaps be some shall i say relief or distress in the fact that much of the book stock since  will disappear sooner or later because of the poor paper it was printed on there is also the certainty that an increased use of books produced or reproduced on film will lessen the demands for storage space but it surely means that even if the storage space does not double every twenty years there will be insistent demand for more storage facilities the inevitable step is of course an increased mechanization of the storage and delivery of books the next consequence is that there will be greater reliance on the catalog and on the printed indexes decreased reliance on the classified groups put at the reader command and increased cost of operation carry this doubling on every two decades for any length of time and we soon reach a realm of fantastic or astronomical magnitude one element of relief will unquestionably come in the recognition of the necessity for greater selectivity greater specialization in additions the next generation will probably see fewer comprehensive collections of books and a greater number of small centers in fields of lesser circuit the problem of book storage and mechanical care of books offers an analogy to the problem of elevator transportation inside a modern office building by increasing the number of elevators the number of floors can be increased if this is carried on indefinitely however the elevators have to carry so much dead weight in shape of equipment or have to use so much valuable floor space as to call a halt on their increase
tomorrow  it was president eliot of harvard who called for a storage warehouse for a separation between dead books and live books his suggestion raised a storm of protest everyone standing up to ask how he or anyone else could say that a given book was ever dead or might not probably be wanted some time or other this protest was adequately voiced in the report of the committee of the harvard faculty drawn up not so long after president eliot made his suggestion at the magnolia meeting of the american library association in i however president eliot in this as in other fields demonstrated his foresight and his intelligence the time is not far distant when we shall perforce have to divide our books not so much into classes of live and dead ones as rather into classes of extensive immediate use and more limited and more distant use is it a wild dream to think that some day perhaps new england libraries will have a central storehouse say in the connecticut valley not so far from springfield not more than a day march for most places offering opportunity for speedy daily transference of books another place perhaps halfway between new york and philadelphia for the libraries in that region other storage warehouses in other parts of the country  there is of course the disadvantage of delay in access to specific titles meaning a wait perhaps of twenty four hours for a book or a trip to the storehouse there is always the increased wear and tear due to transportation and perhaps even more important is the psychological effect on the reader attitude toward the library and its service for he will certainly oppose a change until he has become accustomed to it the advantages are equally obvious i the increased speed and ease of access to the stock kept in the central building  the lessened wear and tear due to less crowded shelves and less frequent shiftings  the increased health or decreased harm for the books stored in places distant from the industrial pollution inevitable in our larger cities  the advantages of pooled resources if these reservoirs can care for the stock of a given region farther on we shall consider how increased facil
 the library quarterly ities of transportation increased ease of telephone connection and the possibilities in such things as television will unquestionably affect this problem of storage while we are dealing with things of such magnitude let us compare the costs of library service today with those of the nottoo distant past and attempt to project these comparisons into the future taking for instance the new york public library not quite forty years ago for the fiscal year of i the first it is fair to compare with later years we find it spent for books  for salaries i all other expenses adding to a total of i for the calendar year i it spent in its reference department for books and prints i  more than three times the i record for salaries i about eighteen times as much as forty years ago a total with everything else added of ii over ten times as much the corresponding figures for yale university library run as follows for books in i  it spent  i   for salaries  and with all other expenses a total of oo for  the corresponding figures are   for books more than six times as much as in i  for salaries a twenty fold advance for all expenses ii fifteen times as much harvard in i spent for books i for salaries  all other expenses  a total of  for i it spent for books  a four and ahalf fold advance for salaries  nearly six times as much all other expenses ii more than ten times as much total og an almost seventimes advance is it fair to assume that forty years hence we shall have the same geometrical increase new inventions and the library of the future and that brings us to a consideration of the effect on the library of new developments in science and industry forty years ago our library records were either entirely manuscript or a combination of manuscript entries and printed forms our catalogs were mainly printed books or manuscript cards though a
tomorrow  few did show cards reproduced by some of the gelatin processes there were at least three sizes of cards in use perhaps more today we see manuscript records only where typing or printing is impossible and those are rare cases our catalogs are primarily on cards standardized as to size thanks to the vision of dr putnam and the library of congress staff these cards are printed today in such large numbers as to make it wasteful to use anything but library of congress cards when they are available and when it is not feasible to print cards we reproduce them by mimeograph multigraph photograph manuscript entries being so few as to call for explanation or justification and we are satisfied with these records  just think for a moment however of the way the combination of the mechanical punching of cards and the use of the electric current have revolutionized the making of records in the fields of statistics and industry why has the library world never applied these methods to its problems how long do we have to wait before a reader is able in this way to identify the cards in the whole catalog which record the particular topic he is searching for these developments are bound to come just when or how or where is something perhaps librarians can answer though we librarians may not head the procession in this respect we are not shamefully far in the rear as to telephone service which is now taken for granted as part of the normal library equipment the time is not long past however when it was necessary to put on one hat and walk to the library to renew a book to verify a quotation to check on an author birthday recently the staff at our information desk at the new york public library was asked to record the questions the telephone shot at them for one typical normal hour as near the average as possible here are a few of the questions do you have brassow on medals and orders have you a list of art schools in new york city which turner wrote on electricity and heat what is the form of address for a monsignor

tomorrow  stat and other photographic means of reproduction in library work needs no comment here it is interesting to note however that it was a yankee from the green mountain state henry stevens of vermont who nearly seventy years ago saw a vision and after ten years of experimenting printed at london in  his photo bibliography or a word on printed card catalogues of old rare beautiful and costly books and how to make them on a cooperative system and two words on the establishment of a central bibliographical bureau or clearing house for librarians the significant development of the technique of the use of reduced film i   or  mmhas aided research by providing an inexpensive and simple method of reproduction and distribution it will certainly aid in easing the problem of storage it is said that new developments in this field make it not fantastic to believe that soon we shall be able to reproduce a whole book of normal octavo size on a  xg card this reduced film will aid in the systematic development of a collection librarians everywhere have been systematically checking recognized bibliographies to locate copies of books not on their shelves this followed up by a moderate expenditure of money for photostat or photographic or film reproductions leads to the realization that in certain groups librarians may look with equanimity on a request for presentation of a given text if it cannot be given the reader in the original it certainly can be handed him in some form of reproduction this new technique will also aid in systematic reproduction of books printed since  on paper too poor to last but with messages too important to lose permanently though perhaps not of sufficient importance to justify commercial reprinting or reproduction it is amusing to look at the new problem these unusual techniques develop we now frequently divide our staff administratively into those charged with the care of printed books manuscripts maps prints etc who pray tell is to care for a typewritten document it is unquestionably manuscript it is unquestionably printed it cannot go to both departments what effect are these new films to have on these divisions into
i the library tuarterly departments will the care of films be so special call for such particular skill as to urge the development of a department or division of films or will these records be stored in the standard bookstack the makers of films tell us today that films must have satisfactory control of temperature and humidity if they are to have any hope of permanence does this mean speedy air conditioning for the whole bookstack or are the films to be kept in a separate storeroom well what is the answer what does it all mean ships are but boards shylock says and sailors men it would be natural for the librarian to cap that line by adding that books are but paper sheets sprinkled with lampblack absolutely true but absolutely misleading back of the ship is the spirit of designer and commander back of the book is the spirit of the man with the message the spirit of the reader hungry to see or hear it that spirit has been with us long enough to makeuus sure that no matter whether we know what books will look like three hundred years from now no matter whether we know how they will be shelved or read or used we are sure that books in some form will play as important a part in the intellectual and cultural life of the community then as they do now as they have done for the past three hundred years and the librarian will play as important and as responsible a part in their interpretation as he has for the past three hundred years
