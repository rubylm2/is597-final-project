an approach to theory and method in general subject heading marie louise prevost c harles a cutter wrote in the preface to his rules but strict consistency in a rule and uniformity in its application sometimes lead to practices which clash with the public habitual way of looking at things when these habits are general and deeply rooted it is unwise for the cataloger to ignore them even if they demand a sacrifice of system and simplicity when he wrote this and charged us to enter compound subjects under their first word he said in effect the public is always right and opened the way to the maelstrom of our present general dictionary catalog cutter did admit that the proponents of the noun rule had a case after quoting john c schwartz on the noun entry only he added this is plausible if the public could ever get as accustomed to the inversion of subject names as they are to the inversion of personal names the rule would undoubtedly be very convenient in saying this he conveyed a truth that he did not then care to have picked up and honestly tried out cutter was set once for all on the haphazard adjective approach to subjects and all of us became set with him and thereby committed to a series of rules most of which contain provisions for their own reversal the clear wisdom of schwartz was swept into the discard and slowly the subject currents in our dictionary catalogs have multiplied and collided until we do not know where we are going at any moment why was so much stress laid by cutter and his followers at the start on subject cataloging according to the public mind the answer seems obvious with other library fathers cutter believed that systematic arrangement by classes and their breakdowns would be adequately cared for by classification our present schemes were very young hopefully starting to grow he was still working on his own expansive which was to be even more expanded when he died systematic arrangement being thus provided for it became a matter of small concern to bow to expediency in our dictionary catalogs in fact it became a virtue but this concept of expediency needs to be examined a little more closely what is the public which we in general libraries serve through the catalog children young people adults the expert the inept the illiterate the savant scientists artists authors teachers and librarians once the diverse nature of the users of the catalog is recognized it becomes a patent absurdity to speak of cataloging according to the public mind as if that mind were a single entity logically there are two alternatives in attempting to construct a subject catalog for the use of the public one is to try to incorporate in it all the entries which  rules for a dictionary catalog th ed washington government printing office i p  schwartz had built up a short number classification and a list of subject headings using the noun approach for his books in the new york apprentices library s cutter op cit p  
theory and method in general subject heading  any of the different classes of users may conceivably look for the other is to construct it according to a system which can be understood by librarians the group which uses it most and which alone is in a position to help those who do not understand it the first alternative is obviously impossible of achievement even if it were possible which it is not to discover all the entries which it might occur to all the users of the catalog to consult and even if it were possible for catalogers to include them all in the catalog the resulting tool would be so huge so unwieldy and so confused with the same subject appearing under various terms that it would defeat its own purpose the second alternative is feasible and it is the one which i am proposing in this paper our present practice i think represents a hopeless attempt to combine the two intrinsically incompatible alternatives to have a system but to modify it so that it will serve all users equally well its failure has been documented in theses and other studies by writers who accepting the assumption that the catalog is intended to serve the user by implication every user point out that to a greater or less degree it does not achieve this objective the usual suggestions are i to make changes in the catalog on the basis of further study of users needs and habits subserving the latter and  to train users in the intelligent use of the catalog by teaching them the rules on which it is based the first suggestion for reasons which have already been pointed out is impracticable except perhaps for a special library serving a relatively small and homogeneous group the second suggestion would be excellent if we had a simple and logical set of rules which were consistently applied but that is what in our attempt to make the catalog all things to all men we are helplessly getting further and further away from no existing general list of subject headings in its entirety is a logically thought out product all are full of the inconsistencies and conflicting ideas concurrent on just growing this does not mean that no rules have been made and followed rather it means that the rules are inconclusive and particularly that they themselves were not disciplined and co ordinated prior to application nor was there any intention to make them inflexible concession mostlytacit has been made to habit and to the difficulties of change an attempt to arrive fully at the principles underlying any list from an examination of the list itself is foredoomed to failure all existing lists are inadequate not easy to lean upon mentally unscientific nowhere are we directly instructed or sufficiently assisted by analogy in the assignment of headings to new subjects or to new aspects of old subjects and up to the present we have spent our thought on detail in the effort to improve things as they are an approach that has got us nowhere the only way to produce a clear theory is to cast loose all ties with the past for the time being to analyze our objectives and our practices and then to reconstitute and in this reconstitution of the catalog it seems clear to me that our aim must be to make it a simpler tool for the librarian and with a modicum of initiation for the intellient reader the less intelligent must lean on professional competence as in fact they see eg patricia b knapp the subject catalog in the college library an investigation of terminology library quarterly xiv july  i 
 the library quarterly always have done in other words we must make plain the truth that no one can use a catalog who does not know how and for those who do know how we must make its use quicker easier and more sure disavowing openly and without shame the pretense that it can be successfully a free for all the following suggestions then are intended to clarify the approach to subject headings primarily for the staff and secondarily for those other users to whom the staff imparts its not very complicated skill current usage versus the noun approach let us look briefly at the types of headings now in use and their arrangement in the catalog a for subjects other than place person or name of event i noun  noun plus subhead after dash  noun plus adjective inverted after comma or noun plus qualifying noun inverted after comma  adjective plus direct subject noun  adjective plus indeterminate noun or adjectival phrase  qualifying noun plus direct subject noun  noun plus qualifying word in parentheses  noun followed by and  composite heading g noun followed by prepositional phrase b for names of events sometimes entered under name of event sometimes with name of event as subhead c for place names i place  place plus subhead  place plus political or other unit in parentheses as state city diocese  place plus political unit in parentheses plus subhead  place plus subhead history plus dates  place plus subhead history plus name of event  place plus geographic division after comma as mount cape  geographic division preceding place name  place plus geographic division in parentheses io place plus geographic division in parentheses plus subhead in the arrangement of these forms in the catalog each form may have its separate alphabet under a given initial subject word we find an alphabet for the dash another for the comma another for the parentheses perhaps and still another for the ands and phrases there may even be more inspired by local idiosyncrasy given a catalog with which one is not intimately familiar no one can anticipate how many alphabets it may be wise to struggle through before giving up the search and the same holds for place names have we not then too many forms too many alphabets too much uncertainty can we not reduce the forms reduce the alphabets and substitute clarity for vagueness and certainty for doubt granted such a possibility who among us will deny its desirability in our early days the voices raised in favor of the noun approach were far too readily silenced this was understandable enough since we were out to popularize our catalogs and the adjective was the path of least resistance for the purpose of learning through experience we probably have had to pass through this phase before we could look at the noun approach cold bloodedly enough to appreciate its invariable basic value yet even in this veritable era of the adjective we have been unable to lean on its invariable use we introduced the subhead with its clarity we introduced the composite heading with its vagueness we introduced the inverted heading but filed it in a stray alphabet of its own we now have so many possibilities even within a single specific subject that we do not know where to look and most of us still cry for more adjectives
theory and method in general subject heading i yet the more strictly we follow the exact meaning of words in choosing them for our headings the more exact will the service rendered by the headings be this is axiomatic but we have kept running away from this concept out of mistaken kindness we seem almost to have lost any appreciation of its worth in our efforts to exalt the popular changeable term the charge that many headings in particular composite and phrase headings are catch alls for the cataloger ease has too much truth in it for our comfort in returning as we should to a criterion of exactness first nothing the writer believes will be of such immediate and steady assistance as the adoption of the noun approach only it is the fact that in all the types of headings now in use however couched the noun identifies the subject with the single exception that when approach is by adjective or qualifying noun as in  the primary noun the direct subject noun may be obscured as the subject nations is obscured in the heading international relations our commercial friends have been wiser than we librarians certain of their guides notably thomas register of manufactures have laid hold unerringly upon this condition and have constructed their tools accordingly cautioning all users to look for the noun only and their tools continue to sell let us examine the working of this principle as applied to headings it might be expressed in the rule all headings begin with the noun indicating the direct subject this removes from our list all approaches by adjective or qualifying noun turning such as are required into see references to use such references at all would be a concession to transition since this rule itself makes them superfluous at present wherever the popular the current the habitual approach to a subject is adjectival from two to an indeterminate number of possibilities exist in most catalogs given our rule applied only one possibility exists it cannot be stressed too much that systematic use of the adjectival phrase may scatter aspects of a given subject to the four winds or literally to the twenty six letters while restriction to the noun plus subhead keeps an entire subject segregated and intact at present we have columns of headings in which school is used as an adjective then schools with numerous subheads and then about two dozen types of schools beginning with as many different adjectives who is to know offhand that attendance is to be found under school accounting under schools and art under art but not under schools at all our persistent use of both methods for a given subject no matter how we differentiate the types of aspect removes logic from the makeup and ease from the use of all our catalogs now imagine knowing in advance that you go to your direct noun first without any question whatever and that going automatically to schools you find in subhead position a single alphabet of all aspectsschools accountiing schools art schools attendance schools centralization schools commercial with no long list of see also references and no further usually incomplete list of references from inversions conceive also the simplicity of establishing a heading for a new aspect no agonized surmises as to what the library of congress will do with it no holdups
the library quarterly of material no temporary assignments to be changed later our choice still arbitrary in the broad sense now follows a consistent indeed a uniform pattern again it should not for a moment be thought that this breakdown of a subject by the use of its subheads only works against the specific service we have from the start and no doubt rightly sought to give schools commercial is precisely as specific as commercial schools and with our direct noun key in mind just as immediately findable the segregation value when it obtains is an added not an alternative service types of headings proposed good headings are or should be i arbitrary terms  definite as to coverage and  specific via the subhead a good list is neither a directory nor a phrasebook its intention is to lead the eye as directly as possible to the salient words indicating subjects and their interrelation using the same method of approach to all subjects and having under each subject a single alphabet of breakdowns aspects and juxtaposed subjects the following are proposed a for subjects other than place or personal names i noun direct subject  noun direct subject plus subhead after dash plus further subheads after dash if required for breakdown  noun direct subject plus qualifying word in parentheses  noun direct subject plus qualifying word in parentheses plus subhead after dash plus further subheads after dash if required  noun direct subject plus subhead with preposition in parentheses inserted after the dash to avoid erroneous or indefinite impression  noun direct subject plus subhead with qualifying phrase in parentheses inserted after the dash to clarify distinct subjects brought into juxtaposition b for names of events including wars name of event invariably with see also to history plus dates as desired c for place names i place  place plus subhead   place plus political unit in parentheses  place plus political unit in parentheses plus subhead  place plus subhead history plus dates  place plus geographic division in parentheses  place plus geographic division in parentheses plus subhead to the instinctive objection by many that breakdown by subhead alone will not be adequate the writer can only submit that it has been found to be so in a list covering now some seven thousand headings with a variety of content fairly analogous to a general list whose principles have served equably and comfortably for seventeen years at the newark business branch and in the transference of its headings to the main library catalog as required hile it is customary to refer to commercial or business service in public libraries as a type of specialization the material required by a business branch even more than by a division in the main building reaches frequently into general subjects the newark list covers many industries trades and businesses together with subjects expressing function as salesmanship others supplying sidelines of data such as those needed in advertising and subjects contributory to business as statistics costs and so on most of the questions concerning breakdown that occur in the construction of a general list apply to it each heading was selected des subheads include noun plus inverted adjective and noun plus inverted qualifying noun the dash being substituted for the comma to insure one alphabet
theory and method in general subject heading fined delimited and co ordinated in the whole to meet known reference needs in the mind of linda h morley who was then in charge of the branch and giving in person topnotch service to it her list prepared for  business books and its supplement and taken over for the branch catalog has the integrity and consistency of a one man job whose maker ability is too well known to require comment her breakdown was entirely by subhead it has been rightly said of our general lists that they give little help to the specialist therefore a list which can compass the general and insert without friction wherever possible provision for the special seems to be the desideratum which we are all seeking the needs of a specialist who approaches a general catalog may be expressed as i ability to reach all material on his subject in a segregated group and  ability to consult this material in full breakdown it would seem that the general catalog should aim at least to supply his first necessity wholly in spreading before him all it has on his primary subject and to include as much of his second necessitybreakdown indication as the library policy of analysis permits further subdivision for the nonce we may have to leave to the special librarian yet if desired it is easily open to us we can i think achieve this service merely by following our two already advocated procedures i to break down by formal subhead only and  to enter under both keys with appropriate subheads when two key headings headings having or fitted to have subheads meet in a subject term never permitting the substitution of a see reference for either a second objection to the noun approachthat too much material will congregate under given nouns is bound up with our present concept of the desirability and expectation of finding our material under adjective and in a small compass this is merely a habit of mind which can be changed the mind can be trained to seize on the salient subject noun as one crosses to the catalog expecting to find all its modifications in a single alphabet of subheads and eye and hand will quickly learn to leap from guide to guide instead of from card to card as we now automatically adjust our approach to the webster or the oxford dictionary it is a matter of orientation once used to it one has a strong staff to lean upon chemical affinity will become automatically chemistry affinity iron trade will become iron trade iron age will become age iron and even intercultural relations a compound adjective hitched to an indeterminate noun will right itself into cultures interrelation unless we agree that race is better than culture for our purpose it will be noticed that the proposed rules permit no composite headings and no running headings except where the name of an event takes a running form the conjunction and rightly should become anathema in headings wherever it now appears it either kills the possibility of definite indication hitches on a useless appendage or presents as alex ladenson has put it recently no real subject area while a preposition in  running heading may lead to vagueness certain current running headings do make good sense the intention here is to eliminate the running form by recasting it in subhead form after morley who found that a preposition in parentheses to signify disregard in filing modifying a subhead was needed for clarity as in salesmanshipto children pro
i the library quarterly vision for it seems of distinct value in a general list also the prepositional phrase invented by morley to indicate type of reader rather than content matter for certain items as accounting for the executive filed at the business branch arbitrarily before accounting for its local reference importance and to draw attention to its unusual intention could well be modified to file in the single subhead alphabet of a general list as accountingfor the executive in other words where needed to modify a subhead a preposition or prepositional phrase may be inserted in parentheses and disregarded in filing except of course to keep itself intact consonant with this disposition of the preposition the eliminated composite or and heading may be replaced in subhead fonn by any requisite brief phrase in parentheses signifying disregard in filing that will tie up lucidly the two key nouns as educationrelation to democracy artrelation to morals railroadsregulation by government churchrelations with state one particularly bad employment of the adjective plus direct noun appears in the present language and literature groups no less than when it occurs in classification does sharp cleavage between headings for the language and for the literature of a country cause trouble to cataloger and reader the reason we have no heading for english in its present frequent coverage of both language and literature other than by a third grouping under philology which seems still further to complicate our differentiation troubles may be laid at the door of our persistent use of the word and of its sister words as adjectives a shift to the substantive meaning would fill the need for a comprehensive term enable us to apply our direct noun approach here also shorten headings and give all material in one instead of several groups this would mean that subheads now in use for both language and literature together with all direct nouns now following the adjective would be thrown into a single secondary alphabet thus english english abbreviations english ballads english business english drama english essays english fiction english grammar english study with further subheads as required this would also apply to tribal names of american indians again beyond everything we need exactness in our terms as the astute among us have declared for a work on the interaction of the dawning peace and another subject we would not continue to assign two vague headings as world war i  peace and say democracy the phrase in parentheses would open the door to such clear exactitude as world war   peaceaffected by democracy world war i  peaceeffect on democracy world war   peaceaffected by education world war   peaceeffect on education world war   peaceaffected by religion world war i  peaceeffect on religion and our rule for double entry for a conjuction or juxtaposition of key headings would add democracyaffected by wvorld war i  peace democracyeffect on world war  peace and so on
theory and method in general subject heading  this would be of great assistance in establishing a heading instanter for a brand new subject since the phrase in parentheses is disregarded in filing except of course for the secondary observance of keeping cards on an identical subject together it would be of no practical moment whatever if the phrasing within the parentheses varied from that employed in sister libraries for example if influence or result were used instead of effect any one of them would answer equally the purpose of anyone approaching the catalog for the latter invariably would come holding nothing in mind but the key nouns the proposed rule for names of events forces all entries for events under the best known generally the only phrase and forbids its use as a subhead this phrase may be subjected to breakdown as for noun though such a breakdown is seldom required the proposed rules for place follow current practice in the latter points i  and reject current practice in the latter points listed as   and  in the following respects i names of events are not to be used as subheads as desired they may also be connected with country subhead history plus dates by see also reference from name of event  geographic division will not be indicated capitalized after place name preceded by comma  geographic division will not precede place name as heading thus differentiation in the treatment of geographic divisions to indicate common verbal usage as cape ann vesuvius mount will be eliminated by the consistent use of parentheses and lower case even for virginia city in the interest of having a single alphabetic line with no filing complications the only apparent exception not a real one is the case in which the word signifying geographic division is not used in its inherent sense as in cape colony some examples of apparent hurdles in heading shift may be given our use of natural history defines it as the consideration of nature in general which may or may not be presented in the form of history the long accepted phrase is bad for its purpose whereas the area it covers is succinctly expressed in the subject nature natural itself is not too clear since it may mean habitual and history may be a misnomer for any title to which it is applied the teachers who caused us to establish nature study were clear thinkers yet in so doing we added to our muddle we should retain for them naturestudy and recast all natural and nature headings into a single alphabet of subheads under nature similarly in the term international relations we are talking about nations their interrelation and the heading becomes nations interrelations in international law two key headings meet to give specialists in both their leads we need both nations law and law international changing the catalog change in any catalog could be made by degrees since we are already using nouns with subhead and inverted headings as well as adjectival compounds and phrases we can start using the first only noun with subhead for all new subjects without preliminary warning then we can go back and change old subjects block by block heading by heading as we get down to them it would not be so bad as reclassification that we should disregard what will seem at first to be odd in the substitution of noun for adjective as long as the sense is plain will be a needed advance
