volume  january  number x de vinne and the de vinne press michael koenig abstract theodore low de vinne   son of a methodist circuit rider and antislavery pamphleteer was apprenticed to the printer of thenewburgh new york gazette at the age of fourteen in  he joined the francis hart company in new york city as journeyman compositor and rose to partnership in  underde vinne management francis hart  company won the contract to print st nicholas in  followed by scribner monthly in  to become the century illustrated monthly in  after the death of hart de vinne purchased the company in  and it became theodore l de vinne and company until his retirement from direct control in  at this time the company took the corporate name of the de vinne press surviving as such until  de vinne pioneered in developing typographic style as a type designer a historian of printing and printing types an adapter of new technology to fine printing and an educator of the printing trade making use of contemporary sources and de vinne writings and printing this article examines de vinne achievements in vanrous areas presenting him as the foremost artist and innovator in american printing in the nineteenth century and a major force in the revival of the printing art a historical sketch theodore low de vinne was born in stamford connecticut on christmas day  he was the second oldest of six sons in a family of eight children his family which was dutch in ancestry the name originally being van der vinne had emigrated to ireland during the religious wars in holland theodore father daniel de vinne was a methodist circuit rider an ardent abolitionist and a major factor in his church gradual espousal of abolitionism though for a time he suffered virtual ostracism for his beliefs and was assigned to the most unattractive circuits available  pp   he devoted considerable time in his later years to scholarship and wrote the methodist episcopal church and slavery  and the irish primitive church  theodore who later dropped the accent from de vinne was wont to ride with his father on circuit and seems to have been particularly close to him of the six sons he was certainly most influenced by his father scholarliness at the age of seven he accompanied his father to the harper brothers printing establishment on cliff street the lifelong friendship between daniel de vinne and john harper may have accounted for the fact that of the six de vinne sons four became printers and two bookbinders in fact john the eldest son was apprenticed to the har
 the library quarterly pers theodore learned latin from his father and attended public school at catskill amenia and white plains new york at the age of fourteen he did some temporary work at a printing office in fishkill new york later that year  he left school ending his formal education and became an apprentice to the printer of the newburgh gazette after working in newburgh for five years and fulfilling the obligations of his apprenticeship de vinne moved to new york to try his fortune there in  after various jobs with different printing offices and a stereotype foundry he began work as a journeyman compositor in the office of francis hart in his new job de vinne soon found himself in a very enviable position hart born in new bedford massachusetts in  and apprenticed there at the age of twelve had moved to new york and set up business in  he was however something of an invalid and desired to be relieved of the burden of operating a printing office in  he advertised his business for sale at the price of  and printed a very complete inventory of all his equipment  pp   but found no takers at a satisfactory price it was only a year later that de vinne entered the scene and immediately making himself invaluable quickly rose to be foreman he took responsibility as fast as hart gladly relinquished it in  de vinne considered seriously the possibility of purchasing a printing establishment in ogdensburg new york hart countered with the offer of a partnership and one third ownership in the company de vinne accepted and the firm became francis hart  company the firm of francis hart had done job work principally with a specialty of service to the legal profession but as de vinne took charge he widened its scope and began to achieve a reputation for quality the bruce type foundry for example selected the firm to print its type specimen books in  the management of the alden typesetting and distributing machine company seeking new capital hired francis hart  company to print an elaborate prospectus the immaculate printing of scores of wood engravings may have helped the firm secure the printing of scribner  company magazine for juveniles st nicholas in  st nicholas magazine had an influence that was substantial though not without rivals it was the preeminent children magazine of its time according to lehmann haupt it was very much an exponent of the new publishing trends of those years  p  among its contributors was an imposing galaxy of eminent authors and authorities including mark twain robert louis stevenson theodore roosevelt walter camp and brander matthews rudyard kipling jungle book was written as a serial for st nicholas as was mrs burnett little lord fauntleroy st nicholas also featured more robust heroes such as jack hazard and the young surveyors the editor was mary mapes dodge author of hans brinker and his silver skates frank stockton prolific novelist and writer of adventure tales was the associate editor and a major contributor the illustrations and art work were particularly distinguished the quarterly illustrator remarked in  that nearly every illustrator of talent and note has got his handiwork between the covers of st nicholas  p  publishing st nicholas was a major event in the growth of francis hart 
de vinne and the de vinne press  company for it gave to the firm a new financial stability a new stature and placed it in a manufacturing status by this time de vinne was completely in charge of the press for hart was faring poorly spending virtually all of his time vacationing on doctor orders in search of his health in  scribner  company dissatisfied with the attempts of several previous printers of scribner monthly to print woodcut illustrations and impressed with the quality of work of the printer of st nicholas approached de vinne to undertake also the printing of scribner monthly hart vacationing in europe counseled against such a large undertaking he received the reply too late it is done  p  this was a decision of some significance for scribner monthly to become in  the century illustrated monthly magazine was for more than a quarter of a century the foremost example of american magazine publishing it achieved a penetration circulation relative to the population of the country and an importance that ias probably never been equaled by my other quality american magazine for example in  the circulalion of the century magazine was over  in contrast to other quality magazines none of which reached that level until seventy years later  pp   the century was particularly noted for its illustrations and featured such engravers as timothy coles william j linton francis c altwood frederick juengling and george kruell artists and illustrators included frederick remington charles dana gibson maxfield parrish howard pyle andre castaigne e w kemble n c wyeth and jules guerin the quality of printing which de vinne did for the magazines was remarkable for its time henry lewis bullen asserted his de vinne first issue of scribner monthly may now be rated as typographically good when it appeared it was hailed as great it was the first american magazine to use old style roman a novelty which was admired when the first issue of the century appeared in  de vinne was setting the pace for the world in magazine making  p  mott a history of american magazines noted that the century gained the reputation of being the best printed magazine in the world  p  de vinne was acknowledged to be the foremost printer of wood engravings of his time alexander w drake art editor of the century whose dissatisfaction with the scribner century previous printer had given de vinne his chance described the care de vinne took with illustrations many a time have i seen mr de vinne have a press stripped and kept it idle for a day or so while new overlays were being cut all this to secure the best possible touch of excellence in the printing of illustrations we would shake the magazine was founded by the collaboration of dr josiah g holland roswell smith and charles scribner the magazine publishing company that resulted was called scribner  company this was distinct from scribner armstrong  company which in  became charles scribner sons a book publishing firm in which charles scribner was the major stockholder although scribner had only a financal not an editorial interest the magazine was named scribner monthly in the fashion of harper to capitalize upon a well known name in  a dispute arose concerning the right of scribner  company to publish books in competition with charles scribner sons the result was that roswell smith bought out holland and scribner scribner  company became the century company and scribner monthly became the century illustrated monthly magazine in return for smith giving up the name scribner charles scribner sons agreed not to establish a rival magazine for five years six years later they began scribner magazine quite a distinct publication from scribner monthly
 the library quarterly our heads over some slightly unsatisfactory form and then the conversation would usually end this way well after all we are here to get quality aren we and devinne would answer youe right have that press stripped hamilton sometimes the ink would be too stiff and de vinne would try a half dozen different inks before he was satisfied it is easily imagined how costly this kind of conscientiousness was not in the long run however for it was just this minute care that built up the reputation of de vinne and the maga zines he printed  he was particularly skillful in his use of overlays pieces of paper in varying shapes which when laid upon the impressing surface of the press increased pressure upon those parts of the impression surface designed to print black and when absent relieved pressure opposite the highlights thereby heightening them to achieve the results he wanted de vinne was quick to seize upon technological innovations such as improved printing presses and composing machines and introduced hard impression surfaces coated paper and other innovations of his own as woodcuts began to be replaced by the halftone process in the early s de vinne did not rest on his laurels but attempted to get the best possible results from the new process when francis hart died in  his will made it possible for de vinne to purchase the firm this was accomplished in six years and in  the firm changed its name to theodore l de vinne  company de vinne only son theodore brockbank de vinne becoming the partner at about this time the firm began using the imprint the de vinne press although it was not incorporated under that name until  when de vinne retired from direct control the de vinne press increased rapidly in size until it employed well over  persons  i though its mainstay continued to be the st nicholas and century magazines the press turned increasingly to book publication varying from the most commercial to limited editions done for bibliophiles among the latter were the grolier club publications of which the de vinne press printed forty five of the fifty five issued before de vinne death and several of those issued afterward but the most significant aspect of de vinne work was the quality of the work done on everyday commercial publications carl purington rollins wrote no american printer has equalled him in the mechanical perfection of book after book which issued from the de vinne press  p  an impressive example of such commercial book work is the century dictionary a multivolume set that is a masterpiece of legibility and typographic functionality as de vinne grew older he devoted more of his time to writing and other outside activities by then the day today direction of the press was carried on by his son theodore b along with james bothwell and r w brown in  de vinne formally relinquished direct control and the firm was incorporated as the de vinne press with de vinne as president r w brown as vice president theodore b de vinne as treasurer and j w bothwell as secretary in his eighty sixth year on monday february   theodore low de vinne died the de vinne press continued in operation for several years with j w bothwell as president but found the going increasingly difficult indeed as early as  de vinne had written to the directors of the press admitting that the press was in a season of adversity but advising the rejection
de vinne and the de vinne press s of an offer of merger from a london firm  p  de vinne had a great deal of business acumen but he had a modest new england sense of what constituted a proper profit the de vinne press was a commercial establishment charging commercial rates but doing quality work and quality work was as always costly this was the de vinne press glory but it made for a very thin profit margin frank hopkins remarked that much work was actually done at a loss  p  the war of course meant a decline in the sort of work which the de vinne press did but the greatest blows to the press were labor troubles and the declining fortune of the century magazine the result was that in  the de vinne press closed its doors de vinne values and ambitions were summed up in a favorite quotation from carlyle to do the duty that lies next to you and do it as well as you can  his concept of his role as a printer was exemplified by a speech he gave to the yale college club of new york in which he said i have given the best part of my life to the making of books that have been sold and read and are not rated as pieces of typographic bric abrac  de vinne s typographic style influence and beliefs de vinne was an advocate of simplicity and good taste in typography good taste as he construed it should be understood as a synonym for propriety it means order symmetry and the observance of seemly arrangements that have the sanctions of age and authority in typesetting it means the putting of right types in right places it does not mean departure from methods that have commanded general respect composition is but the architecture of words and it must be governed by general rules of law and order that are observed not only in that art but in every kind of worthy construction  p  one element of typographic style that particularly concerned de vinne was the composition of title pages indeed his book a treatise on title pages  which is nearly  pages in length is still the most complete study of the history of the title page yet written as well as a critical study de vinne argued that a title page should be as simple as possible as a rule the more words there are in a title the more ineffective is the composition  p  this was an important break from victorian printing style the statement was made by de vinne in a lecture to the grolier club on january   and establishes his position as an early leader in the movement against the fussiness and overornateness of nineteenth century printing in decorations de vinne was again on the side of simplicity he freely admitted that in his youth he had been guilty of the same excesses as his contemporaries  but his taste for simplicity matured ahead of his time and he was soon vigorously condemning profuse ornamentation he was frequently wont to quote the architects maxim you may ornament construction but you may not construct ornamentation  p  in an article entitled the decoration of books de vinne said simply decoration is of questionable value for any book expected to be permanent fashions change rapidly the books   in the best typographical style are of the severest simplicity  the chief fault of modern typography said de vinne is over decoration  p 
 the library quarterly this deemphasis of decoration was a logical product of de vinne conception of the purpose of a book a book should be so planned that every contributor to it keeps his place and first place should always be given to the author the book so produced may have a quaker like simplicity but its workmanship will be respected and preserved when more pretentious printing has been forgotten  p  his most endearing and quotable remark concerning style and decoration is the following the proper function of types is to convey instructions and  they are not improved by decoration any more than a trowel is by painting or a saw by gilding  p  spacing and a proper relief of white were major concerns of de vinne as usual legibility was the primary reason behind his opinion but stylistic considerations entered into it as well he was fond of quoting ruskin the eye is not saddened by quantity of white but it should be saddened and greatly offended by quantity of black  p  de vinne pointed out that in the early days of printing because of the extremely large percentage of the printer cost which paper represented placing great emphasis upon its efficient use compression had been something of an economic necessity however in the nineteenth century this was no longer true paper was relatively very cheap the need for the most efficient use of paper was no longer pressing and hence there was no longer any reason de vinne felt why type composition should not be governed by the desire to achieve maximum legibility and convenience of use de vinne fought against fads in book typography and design indeed updike remarked that his only fad was his fear of them  p  he delighted im showing the inconsistencies in what patrons desired and in what they regarded as artistic in particular he made fun of the kelmscottian penchant for deckled edges which he pointed out resulted from an ignorance of printing history for in the period of typography that morris was emulating the deckle edges were meant to be trimmed off when the purchaser had his book bound he similarly ridiculed the penchant for rough stiff paper the use of vellum the substitution of v for u and the infatuation with printing by hand press  although de vinne was quick to adopt the caslon revival of the s and used the face widely his favorite was modern roman somewhat heavier than the bodoni influenced moderns of the early mnneteenth century the century roman exemplified his preference for a middle ground he regarded the bodoni typefaces and the scotchromans derived from them as feminine conversely he rejected black letter and much of morris work as too heavy and black de vinne and morris because of the strength of his own convictions de vinne was remarkably unswayed by the phenomenon of william morris while on the whole he approved of morris himself de vinne took some very definite exceptions to his ideas the kelmscott books deserve high praise for faithfulness to the best features of fifteenth century printing but not every feature calls for praise  his objections to particulars of style concerned the overdenseness of morris compositions his lack of leading and spacing and particularly the illegibility of his composition and his type de vinne admitted that the
de vinne and the de vinne press  morris style of extremely thin spaces and no leading was applicable to black letter a character plainly designed to show compression and huddling in every letter but it is not at all applicable to roman letter that is just as plainly designed to show roundness and openness  p  he called the troy type uncouth  p  he pointed out that three centuries previously the reading world outside of germany had decided that it had had enough of characters such as morris mongrel gothic  on the other hand morris drew praise for his wonderful skill in presswork and for his avoidance of certain affectations such as the long s  de vinne recognized that morris was reacting to the meanness of nineteenthcentury typography and to the overproliferation of worthless typefaces just as he himself had this met with his approval but he felt that morris had overreacted it is possible that he has gone too far in the field of reform but his steps have been in the right direction    he deserves high praise for his efforts to put typography back in its proper field  unlike virtually everyone else at the time de vinne did not regard morris as much of an innovator first the reaction to feminine types had been begun by printers like himself and charles jacobi well before morris entry into the field of printing second de vinne did not regard morris form of reaction or overreaction as original in the s andrew tuer of london began to reprint old english chap books that were noticeable for rudeness blackness and uncouthness  p  and de vinne regarded tuer as the herald of the movement which was to find morris its most effective spokesman de vinne felt andrew tuer exhibited in an exaggerated form the mistakes made by morris and his followers that is a slavish imitation of a previous period of typography including its mistakes on the whole de vinne regarded morris influence as unfortunate and mischievous  p  for printers and bibliophiles adopted the form of morris work without the spirit unfortunately the morris types and the morris methods have been copied by printers who pervert them from their proper use which is the reprinting of medieval books on medieval subjects they reproduce in books on modern subjects morris mannerlsms that make them almost unreadable  it is as absurd to use the troy type for a modern novel or poem as it would be to use it for a dictionary a directory or a daily newspaper yet there are amateurs who do not see the impropriety of this perversion  p  the result of this de vinne believed was that typefounders following in their steps produced letters and decorations of such uncouthness that at no point in the history of printing has there been more extravagance or eccentricity in the form of types or more silly affectation in the composition of types than there is now there never was a time when orderly workmanship was more disparaged and vulgarisms and uncouthness had more generous toleration  de vinne criticism is therefore not so much directed at morris whom he had met and admired as at his unwitting results an interesting example of de vinne basic understanding of what morris was trying to accomplish was his prescient remark after morris death that it is a little remarkable that william morris in his search for a characteristic letter for his kelmscott books should have neglected
 the library quarterly the first model of roman letter which appeared some years before the type of jenson the lactantius type has the gothic peculiarities which morris not so successfully tried to graft upon the golden type he made in imitation of the jenson roman  he praised the use of such a type called subiaco the place where sweyhnam  panhartz printed the lactantius by the ashendene press of st john and cicely hornsby what he did not know was that this type made by walter  cockerell for st john hornsby and cut by edmund prime was in fact the completion of a project that morris himself had started but had not managed to complete before his death and did in fact represent what morris desired the transitions between gothic and roman  pp   the great difference between de vinne and morris lay in the different bases from which they approached printing illuminating is this remark by de vinne william morris maintained that printing had gone steadily from bad to worse until he revised its best features many publishers maintain with more reason that books of real value for instruction or amusement were never better filled than they are now for usefulness to all classes of readers  p  for de vinne the paramount aspect of the book was utility improved technology could promote utility de vinne strove to put technology at the service of the best in tradition and regarded morris retreat from technology as missing the point of printing de vinne as a type designer de vinne was the force behind the cutting of two fonts of type the century family of types and the renner though the type known as de vinne is of course associated with him there was no actual connection the name being purely complimentary in fact de vinne disliked the face objecting to some of the capitals as grotesque and debated over whether he should allow his name to be used with it but concluded it would be rude to refuse the honor   p  de vinne tastes ran to the simple the strong and above all to the legible he disliked hyperrefined overornamented and overelaborate types with the refinements of razoredged hairlines and eye irritating serifs these he characterized as feminine he preferred sturdy legible unornamented strong lined types with intense black ink and appropriate spacing these he characterized as masculine attributes this unfortunate phraseology makes it appear that de vinne saw the situation in a rather too crude light however he did not prefer strong lined types and black inking for their own sake his criticism of morris heavy letters demonstrates that he occupied a logical and defensible middle ground holding that requirements of legibility overruled other considerations though he was interested in style legibility of type was always de vinne principal concern he put his philosophy in the slogan legibility first decoration last  p  the century family of type originally designed as the name suggests for the century magazine illustrated his beliefs the basis of the family was de vinne century expanded and from this were produced various adaptations such as century broadface much used by the century company for book work century schoolbook and century catalog century expanded was essentially a modernized old style charor this de vinne had high regard considering it the best of the private presses while for the vale and the roycroft presses he was rather disp ginr i reark
de vinne and the de vinne press  acterized by a slight upward expansion and by a thickening of the hairlines the upward expansion was intended to produce a type more appropriate for cramped double column magazine printing the thickening of the hairlines intended to produce greater legibility was the result of several factors the first was de vinne realization that the use of dry paper and hard packing which had replaced dampened paper and soft packing for most commercial uses in the early s had changed the relationship between the physical shape of the face of the type and the image it produced upon the paper a thin line for example would produce a far thicker result when impressed upon damp paper backed by an elastic blanket than it would on dry and calendered paper against a hard impression the effect would be proportionately greater and particularly noticeable upon the thinner lines de vinne seems to have been among the first printers to have been aware of this effect and write about it and the first to attempt to counter it there is an air of propriety in this since de vinne is credited with being the first printer to turn to the use of dry paper and was one of the earliest if not the first to use hard packing de vinne second reason for thickening hairlines was his belief that even before the introduction of hard packing and dry paper types had become too delicate this he attributed to the indirect influence of thomas bewick and his followers who by demonstrating that they could create the lightest grays and the most vigorous blacks on the same block were paving the way for a typographic revolution it was unwittingly done but very effectual he bewick was creating the belief that the merit of a book must be judged not so much by the thought of the author by the readability of the type or by the skill of the printer as by the beauty of the illustrations the success of this revolution in method was greatly aided by the timely invention of the hand press entirely of iron that gave increased strength and accuracy bewick imitators many of them men of great ability undertook a foolish competition with line engravers and produced blocks showing a strength and delicacy that had never been attained on wood type founders followed their example and made delicate types the merit of printing was supposed to be in its delicacy and not in its strength the strong and readable type made by french and dutch printers of ability were put aside as coarse and old fashioned and types of light face with exceedingly sharp hair lines almost invisible to the ordinary eye took their place these radical changes were largely aided by the invention of the fourdrinier paper making machine which made paper in an endless web and of a uniform thickness with paper of finer texture with presses of greater strength with types and engravings of greater delicacy printers everywhere began to imitate the copper plate printer and the lithographer  finally and most important de vinne thickened the hairlines in order to improve legibility many of the justifications of de vinne arguments now seem naive but in general de vinne appears to have been attacking the matter of legibility from the correct basis and it can be argued that he appreciated surprisingly well the essence of gestalt and pattern recognition though of course he did not and could not verbalize those then unformulated concepts to illustrate his arguments against ultrathin hairlines de vinne used the example of a continental font of type in which the  and  n the trade expansion usually refers to an increase in the width to height ratio de vinne consciously reversed this usage to avoid calling his type compressed to avoid ambiguity he used the phrase upward expansion s noted by de vinne on one occasion william blades remarked in passing that fleischmann a renowned punch cutter for the ensched foundry would hardly recognize his own types printed by modern presswork on sized and calendered paper but he made no more of it  p 
 the library quarterly have a basically identical pattern and are distinguishable only by the positioning of minuscule hairlines  p  similarly he placed a great deal of emphasis upon ascenders and descenders allocating to them a particularly large portion of the face of the type ibid p  and these ascenders and descenders do play a very important part in pattern recognition he also frequently made the distinction between the effect of letters viewed singly and the effect of a page of type composed of them ibid pp   all of these emphases indicate an awareness of the importance of pattern recognition for type legibility de vinne efforts at achieving legibility would seem to have been relatively successful frederick w goudy in his typologia  pp   reported on a study of legibility undertaken at clark university in  comparing twenty six different typefaces in which century expanded rated fifth in overall legibility third among the book types tested in a more elaborate series of experiments conducted by g w ovink at the university of utrecht in the late s  pp   twenty four american and english typefaces for book use were tested century catalog ranked fourth century schoolbook eighth and century expanded twentieth again the comparison is on the whole favorable for the century series with the exception of century expanded which rated poorly however as de vinne made plain this type is a special purpose type and was in a sense tested out of context the result might very well have been different had the format of the test been the double column magazine format for which the century expanded was designed more recently  sir cyril burt reported in his a psychological study of type faces that century seemed to be the most readable of the semimodern typefaces though the face was not examined in depth  p  the century types though not now so widely used as they once were are still in common use indeed a new display series of the century face was brought out as recently as   p  in addition the century types were important for two reasons first the century typeface was the first to introduce the notion of a family of types it was the first type on which a whole proportionate sequence of related weights and sizes was built  p  that is the larger sizes of types were made proportionate to the regular book composition sizes and were designed to be used with them this allowed a unity of style particularly appropriate for such use as advertising where one would want to use several sizes together this innovation was widely accepted and today is so taken for granted that there are few general purpose types designed which do not incorporate the feature of a family of sizes second the century type has been called the forerunner of cheltenham the immensely popular and influential product of the american type foundry indeed in  g w ovink referred to cheltenham as the type which became and is partly still the most popular type in the world  p  the critical acceptance of the type among typophiles however was extremely negative primarily because of its simplicity mechanical perfection and lack of character nonetheless as far as influencing the product of the workaday world is concerned the century face and its successor cheltenham were perhaps far more successful than the troys and the goldens which attracted critical favor
de vinne and the de vinne press  de vinne also designed one other type renner this design was in a large sense due to the influence of william morris but unlike virtually everyone else who at that time was typographically influenced by morris de vinne work was not done in imitation of him rather it was an attempt to do what morris had done and to do it better to show morris in effect what he should have done the renner type was intended to be bold but not at all black to be a rebuttal to the products of the kelmscott press the best though indirect illustration of the purpose of this typeface is a letter of november   from mark h liddell editor of the elizabethan shakspere which the de vinne press printed in renner type o james bothwell de vinne foreman in which he says we have secured the prime beauty of early printing without having to resort to medieval man revisions and so far we have beaten william morris at his best no borders no black illegible type no crowding of matter no sacrificing of sense to aesthetic demands all clear straight legible printing single direct and forceful  pp   de vinne reaction to the book and his concurrence is expressed by it promises to be  one of the best if not the best book we shall ever print ibid p  de vinne seems to have received less credit for the actual design of his types than he deserves linn boyd benton for example is frequently given credit as the designer of the century typeface though in fact he merely followed de vinne directions coincidentally it was benton who invented the pantographic benton punch cutting machine which made the punch cutter intermediating between designer and product so much less important goudy the dean of american type designers said this of de vinne if i were asked to say what i think has been the greatest single influence on my work as a type designer i would be hard put to find a satisfactory reply but there is no doubt in my mind that the principles set forth in this article the old  the new a friendly dispute between juvenus  senex and in his book notable printers of italy during the th century have certainly loomed large in crystallizing the character of my types the consistency of thought he displayed his sound knowledge of old types his fairness in consideration of each moot point the simple yet lucid presentation of his ideas and opinions interested me they influenced my own thought and in turn are reflected in my work  de vinne as a printing historian in  at the height of the costergutenberg controversy appeared de vinne the invention of printing  an exhaustive methodical yet easy to read and well balanced well reasoned account of the evidence concerning who invented what where and why de vinne brought to his work an unparalleled knowledge of the mechanics of the printing trade he was one of the first practitioners of the new bibliography of the second half of the nineteenth century these bibliographers believed as de vinne put it that the internal evidences of old books are of higher authority than legends and that these evidences are conclusive not to be ignored or accommodated to the statements of early chroniclers  p  perhaps the most spectacular result of this approach from the basis of the mechanics of printing was de vinne hypothesis that the four pieces mentioned in several places in the strasbourg documents of  referred to hese documents are reproduced by de vmne in the original alsatian and in english german and french translations with extensive notes  pp   
 the library quarterly a type mold de vinne concluded that the type mold was the essential part of what we call the invention of printing in the western world it was the origin and symbol of the art he was the inventor of typography and the founder of modern printing who made the first adjustable type mold  pp   at greater length he wrote it is tribute enough to acknowledge that the inventor of the type mold was the inventor of typography it is not logical nor truthful to attribute to him the introduction or the rediscovery of the simple elements of relief printing it is not derogatory to his honor to confess that his labors were materially lightened by the services of men who had gone before him and had prepared materials for his use the inventor of the type mold did not invent paper for that had been known for two centuries before he did not originate engraving on wood nor impressions from relief surfaces for both processes were known before paper was made he was not the first to print upon paper for printed matter in the forms of playing cards and prints of pictures was a merchantable commodity before he was born he was not the first to make printed books it is not certain that he made the first printing press it is not probable that he was the first to think of movable types his merits rest on a securer basis while others dreamed and thought and no doubt made experiments he was the first to do practical and useful work the first to make types that could be used the first to demonstrate the utility of typography ibid pp   with this statement de vinne eliminated from his consideration letters carved on bark wood types block books and letters cast in sand though they were attempts to the same end as representing what we know as typography relying on the evidence of the strasbourg trial and with this concept of the meaning of typography he had little hesitation in crediting gutenberg with the invention of printing de vinne exercised scholarly acumen and objectivity in his historical studies not inappropriately both yale and columbia awarded the honorary degree of master of arts to the printer who had been apprenticed at the age of fourteen and who had taught himself german french and italian so that he could personally read the documents involved in his research in addition to the invention of printing  de vinne was the author of several other books on the history of printing his plain printing types  one of a  volume set entitled the practice of typography    contains a great deal of information concerning the evolution of printing types his historic printing types  originally a lecture before the grolier club covered much of the same ground the two were seminal to updike later printing types a study of survival  other works which contained much historical information were title pages as seen by a printer  and an elaboration of this a treatise on title pages  christopher plantin and the plantin moretus museum at antwerp  and notable printers of italy during the fifteenth century  de vinne was frequently a contributor of historical articles and prefaces to other books and compilations for example he contributed the prefaces to the grolier club first publication a reprint of a decree of star chamber concerning printing  and to the typothetae reprint of joseph moxon mechanick exercises  it was to periodical literature however that his contributions were particularly important for he contributed historical articles to general as well as trade publications and brought a knowledge of some of the facets of the history of printing before a wide audience for scribnercentury he wrote such articles as john gutenberg 
de vinne and the de vinne press  the growth of woodcut printing  the first editor  aldus manutius and a printer paradise the plantin moretus museum at antwerp  he contributed to other general magazines such as outlook and the eclectic for trade publications he contributed perhaps a dozen articles for example william caxton  old specimen books  the mazarine bible  giambatista bodoni  medieval printing  that helped give printers a sense of their identity and of the continuity of their craft de vinne was an important figure in the new bibliography the primary american exponent of the new school he and blades were as stanley morison makes clear the english speaking world two foremost printer historians  p  de vinne and technology from the beginning of his career de vinne was interested in the technology of his craft in its possible improvement and in utilizing and getting the best results from those improvements for book printing it was not until the s that the centuries old technique of printing with a dampened sheet upon an elastic packing gave way to the speedier and more precise method of printing on dry paper against a hard inelastic backing although this technique allowed greater possible precision of results it required greater precision on the part of the printer and his tools the firm of francis hart  company has been credited with being the first to use dry paper for quality work  this was a very important innovation essential to many later typographic advances such as the web press because of his position in the firm de vinne must certainly have been involved though de vinne himself gave the credit to hart  p  edmund c gress a personal friend of de vinne maintained that de vinne was the actual innovator  p  and george french implies it  given de vinne technological bent his modesty and the relationship betwen hart and de vinne the latter seems the more reasonable interpretation de vinne stated in a typically indirect and modest fashion that he was the first in modern times to use a metal impression surface in a lecture before the grolier club he mentioned that christopher plantin account books showed that he had purchased copper platens for six of his presses which indicated that plantin knew the value of a hard impression surface three centuries before the printer of the century tried as he thought for the first time the experiment of iron and brass impression surfaces for inelastic impression  p  in an article in the century on woodcut printing de vinne elaborated that the first modern hard impression surfaces had been made of mill glazed pressboard a form of hard cardboard and that later metal had been introduced he made the claim that he was the first of the magazine men to utilize the new process  p  both of these claims were made relatively soon after the fact by an acknowledged if not impartial authority and they met with no disclaimer though they were aired in public circumstances a lecture before the grolier club an organization which contained many people knowledgeable about printing and its techniques and in the pages of scribner century near the height of its circulation and importance during this same period the firm of francis hart  company began to print job work and books on a cylinder
 the library quarterly press this is credited with being the first successful use in america of a cylinder press or any sort of nonplaten press for quality work george french said in  fine printing on cylinder presses was considered impossible until this firm francis hart  company persisted in experiments and finally discovered how to make a form ready and produce good job work on a cylinder press  the use of coated paper was perhaps de vinne single most important technological contribution coated paper that is paper treated with some sort of material such as clay to fill in the pores and produce a smooth surface had been invented in the early nineteenth century and had been used in a limited way for wall paper and box covering in  a patent had been issued to richard magee of philadelphia for the manufacture of coated writing paper but this was little used  in  de vinne conceived of the idea of the use of coated paper as an aid to printing woodcuts charles m gage a paper maker of springfield massachusetts produced the first coated oneside paper for de vinne in that year  p  the innovation was successful and in  when gage went to work for the s d warren paper company de vinne transferred his business there in  the company succeeded in producing paper coated on both sides and the first products of the new process were used by de vinne in the printing of the century indeed that grade of paper was known for many years as century enamel de vinne experimentation with coated paper for book work was particularly timely for comparatively soon thereafter beginning in  wood engraving began to be supplanted by the newly developed process of photoengraving which had the advantage of quicker and easier production de vinne and others immediately began experimenting with the new system problems arose because the copper halftone plates were so shallow that strength was abandoned for delicacy in printing on even the best calendered paper the plates had to be touched up reengraved and burnished by hand to insure proper printing of the deeper tones even then there was often a distressing lack of uniformity from sheet to sheet caused primarily by minute variations in the surface of the paper coated paper was the primary and most important element in the solution of these problems originally used by de vinne as an aid to printing woodcuts coated paper became with the advent of halftone processes extraordinarily important the coat of whiting laid on after calendering produced a surface of fastidious smoothness upon which de vinne printed with a brilliance never before achieved    de vinne insistence upon quality in conjunction with the quantity demanded by magazine production produced a keen interest in the design and possible improvement of the printing press itself this interest and a shared hobby of book collecting led to a long and firm friendship with robert hoe of hoe brothers inc manufacturers of printing presses the result was the collaboration between de vinne and the hoe firm in the production of a new design of rotary web perfecting press made to de vinne specifications for interestingly this coating had a very positive effect in improving the permanence of the poor paper of the time although neither devinne nor the paper makers were aware of this happy consequence personal conversation with joseph g thomas director of research for the s d warren paper company
de vinne and the de vinne press  the production of the century magazine the press was completed in  and was capable of printing on both sides of the paper each cylinder held thirty two plates each plate representing one page the press was used for the plain and advertising pages with the graphic sections of the magazine being done separately but it was as robert hoe points out the first and for three years the only web press being used in this country for good book work  p   p  compared with the web perfecting presses used for newspapers this press was slower but more accurate and more flexible and capable of much more complex cutting and folding operations the success of this experiment led to the design of the rotary art press for the printing of illustrations with which de vinne became the first american printer to do quality work on a rotary press previously illustrations such as characterized the century had had to be done on a platen press or on a stopcylinder press the stop cylinder press invented in france in  by dutarte and brought into this country in  by the hoe firm was a flat bed cylinder press although it produced high quality work it was relatively slow the rotary art press was set up in the de vinne press in  it printed only on one side because de vinne felt that even with the best inks then available in order to insure that the fine lines of the illustrations not be smudged one side must be allowed to dry before the paper could be printed on the other side the cylinder however was larger than in the previous press and contained sixty four plates so that the amount of printing per cycle was equivalent or more important the number of pages involved in each setting up of the machine was equivalent the press printed from single sheets it was not a web press two principal improvements made in the rotary art press allowed the printing of illustrations the machine was made remarkably sturdy to permit great rigidity and precision so that it would not give or spring under the strongest impression the shafts of the plate and the impression cylinders for example were each four and one half inches in diameter made of hardened steel the inking provisions were particularly generous it had sixteen inking rollers as compared with seven for example on the web perfecting press described above this was probably the direct result of de vinne influence for in an account of printing in the nineteenth century he remarked on the inadequate provision for inking of most presses and of the need to correct this  he said of the new press it can be made responsive to the slightest overlay  and does the work of four stop cylinders in superior style the gain in performance is not as great as the gain in quality of presswork but quality was considered more than speed  p  de vinne was a very vocal advocate of the rotary press and argued against the misconceptions and traditions that prevented its being adopted more quickly and more completely in particular he argued that the belief that quality work demanded a hand or stop cylinder press was not only out of date but incorrect that in general the rotary press was capable of better work the de vinne press was one of the first perhaps the first to use the linotype type composing machine or any composing machine for quality work the linotype which was patented by ottman mergenthaler in  was first used in the printing of the new york
 the library quarterly tribune in  it went into production in a redesigned form and was offered commercially in  on may   de vinne reported in a letter to j w phinney  of boston that the press had started using its typesetting machine that not a great deal of work had been accomplished but that he thought the outlook was good de vinne in short took up the new invention with remarkable speed an outcome rather to be predicted in the light of his views concerning the promise and importance of type composing machines as early as  in an article he wrote commemorating the death of gutenberg he predicted that in roughly another four hundred years the world would in similar fashion be celebrating the four hundredth anmnversary of the man who first invented the art of setting type by machinery  p  an event that de vinne believed would be and of course was of great importance de vinne was concerned with virtually every aspect of the technology of printing for example he wrote to a friend in  concerning electroplating the only practical improvement in electroplating that i think of decided importance is that of pressing the plate flat while it is still in a plastic or semi fluid state we have done this successfully for some time a much better way would be to fasten the electrotype shell in a steel mold to exhaust the air from the mold and to cast the plate to the exact size including head margins with the bevels so that the plate would be as finished as a type when that comes from the mold i do not see my way clearly to do it but i believe it will be done before the century is out  it was as a matter of fact a member of de vinne firm patrick j furlong previously of the government printing office who was the first to succeed in producing stereotype plates to the standard of accuracy needed for high quality work on rotary presses  no detail was too small or too trivial to escape his eye for the printing of the century dictionary whose degree of complexity at that time   demanded that it be set by hand de vinne devised a new form of composing stand to hold the twelve different cases used within easy reach of one compositor  pp    de vinne was modest about his innovations the above for example is mentioned as his own innovation only in the index of modern methods of book composition ibid the technological preeminence of the de vinne press continued into the twentieth century the press was one of the first to experiment with and use the new methods of color reproduction and was awarded the gold special medal of award of the american institute of graphic arts for the results it obtained with four color process printing in summary de vinne was an eager exponent of technological innovations adapting them with great patience and skill to do quality printing he was not content to rest on his laurels when he had achieved mastery of a piece of equipment but was always searching for new devices to improve both the speed and quality of printing his own writings and those of others who knew him make it appear that he was personally responsible for the introduction of many innovations himself to verify all of these one would have to do more extensive research for the assignment of firsts is a hazardous act however one feels that de vinne would hardly pparently this was a linotype although typedistributing machines were still sometimes loosely referred to as typesetting machines de vinne had used type distributing machines for many years and would not have referred to them as new
de vinne and the de vinne press  have cared about the credit he was more concerned with gaining mastery of the tools that were produced and with doing printing of consistently high quality book collector as a book collector de vinne specialized in books on printing the collections of david wolfe bruce to whom de vinne dedicated the invention of printing and james lenox had been the starting places for de vinne historical research but he found them inadequate as a result he built what carl l canon describes in his american book collectors as the first significant book collection concerning typography and the mechanics of printing in this country  p  after his death the more than  items from his collection were sold at auction among them were eighty six incunabula a not insignificant number for a collector who was neither overwhelmingly wealthy nor free to devote more than a fraction of his time to the acquisition of books in addition to his collection at home de vinne maintained a sizable typographical library at the press which when he died was acquired in toto by henry lewis bullen typographic and graphic arts library in jersey city new jersey the reputation of de vinne collections in his lifetime is illustrated by the fact that horace hart of the oxford university press wrote requesting information concerning an english manual of typography john smith the printer grammer containing a concise history of the origin of printing also an explanation of the superficies gradation  properties of the different sorts and sizes of metal types    london  which the bodleian did not possess but of which de vinne had two copies plus the original edition without the history of   when the collection was offered at auction in  henrietta bartlett rarebook librarian at yale university contributed an introduction to the sale catalog in which she described it as the finest library on the history of printing which has ever been offered for sale in this country  a founder of the grolier club de vinne work with the century magazine with which many eminent literary and artistic people were connected his growing reputation as a scholar of the history of printing and the growing reputation of his press as one that did quality work combined to place him in the midst of new york circle of bibliophiles and scholars of the book he was one of the nine people all collectors of books of one degree or another who on february   met at the home of robert hoe press manufacturer bibliophile and close friend of de vinne to organize the grolier club the oldest existing american club devoted exclusively to the art of the book their purpose was the literary study and promotion of the arts entering into the production of books although robert hoe was elected the first president de vinne had a great influence upon the club he was its sixth president and a member of its committee on publications from  until his death the first publication of the grolier club was a suggestion of de vinne a reprint of the decree of star chamber of  four of the publications of the grolier club    were written by de vinne and forty five of the fifty five volumes printed by the grolier club prior to de vinne death were printed at the de
 the library quarterly vinne press and seen through the press by de vinne himself  p  the influence of the grolier club upon american printing has been widely recognized as being very significant bruce rogers remarked that among the first of the recent efforts to infuse into printing something of the quality that made the earlier books so interesting were the publications of the grolier club of new york their books printed at the de vinne press were the most ambitious that america had produced before the influence of morris was felt  p  in addition to the books the club was important because of its exhibitions and its proselytizing more than any other such organization the grolier club worked to make the public aware of good printing the promotion of the arts organizer and educator of is trade the welfare and the state of the printing industry as a whole were matters of great concern to de vinne shortly after becoming a partner in francis hart  company in  he began to take an active role in the leadership of his trade in  francis hart  company published a short lived trade periodical entitled the printer miscellany of which de vinne was the editor and to which he contributed articles during this same period for the betterment of trade conditions within the industry de vinne and others principally peter c baker and c a alvord began to work toward some sort of organization of new york master printers this began modestly enough in  with the practice of assembling at lunch to discuss business matters gradually a rather loose organization evolved known variously as the printers of new york the employing printers association and the associated employing printersthe latter name being the most used de vinne was the secretary of this organization on march   the group was formally organizedthe first such in the country the name typothetae of the city of new york was chosen at the suggestion of peter c baker who had seen the name used for german master printers societies typothetae was derived from the greek typos type and thetos setting c a alvord was chosen as president and de vinne the youngest member of the group at the age of thirty six was named secretary despite the fact that the organization of the employing printers followed hard upon the unionization of their employees it does not seem that their purpose was to combat the unions rather the intent seems to have been to foster the adoption of uniform trade prices and to alleviate the problems of cutthroat competition between scores of small competing printing houses in  de vinne published his influential printer price list a manual for the use of clerks and bookkeepers in job printing offices  designed to combat this problem it was so successful in alleviating the situation that the typothetae had been formed to remedy that the organization accordingly became somewhat superfluous and moribund until it was revivified in the early s the intent of the printer price list was not however to set an exact price for every contingency but as de vinne stated in the preface its best use will be found not so much as a final authori so short lived that it is not mentioned in the union list of serials columbia university library has some copies this was the culmination of much effort by de vinne for earlier works see  
de vinne and the de vinne press  ity on prices but as a guide to the making of prices in a systematic manner  p  opposite every important table there was a blank table in which users could adjust and supply their own figures it was de vinne thesis that while most printers knew the mechanics of their trade too few of them had a sufficient knowledge of business to accurately set fair and reasonable prices upon their work in particular he was concerned with the tendency of many printers to charge prices that covered immediate expenses such as labor but did not take into account overhead and long term expenses such as equipment depreciation in short he deplored the tendency to charge on the basis of variable and incremental costs while ignoring or underestimating fixed costs and thereby setting a standard that was in the long run unprofitable to the printing profession the printer price list was part a major part of his campaign to educate printers in proper cost analysis the influence of the book was immediate and widespread though it was designed with the problems of the printers of new york in mind it was immediately adopted as the standard with near unanimity in philadelphia and boston as well as new york indeed it became the standard nationwide of course differing wage scales made interpolation necessary elsewhere the book contained such a wealth of information that it was of major importance as a handbook and would have been essential to printers on that point alone the burgeoning power of trade unionism precipitated the revivification of the typothetae of new york in  although de vinne played a relatively minor role he was elected first vice president and succeeded to the presidency in  employing printers associations were being formed in other cities for the same reasons and in september of  the chicago typothetae called for a convention for the purpose of discussing plans for united action against these demands  p  representatives of seventeen local typothetae met in chicago on october   and formed the united typothetae of america the structure of the united typothetae was particularly loose as de vinne who was the first full term president    remarked at the second convention it is not in our plan to coerce unwilling or half willing members in obedience to a policy they do not approve we are here for counsel and for that cheerful and voluntary concert of action which comes only from a conviction of the justice of the counsellings  p  in general in view of the purpose of its founding the united typothetae was surprisingly modest and inactive in opposition to union demands how much of this was the influence of de vinne who drafted its code of ethics is impossible to determine but it did represent his view of its proper role although not so important in the organization of the united typothetae one of de vinne ideas eventually determined the typothetae major importance this was to provide the printer with information he needed and to assist him in his continuing education de vinne took a particular interest in this aspect carl p rollins in speaking of de vinne advocacy and promotion of the united typothetae of america says this national organization through its education of the employers in learning their actual costs of operation and in charging fair prices for their r harver smith was president pro tem for a period in  but de vinne is usually referred to as the first president
 the library quarterly product has done for the employing printers what in its own field the international typographical union has done for the employees in stabilizing the printing industry in america de vinne efforts in connection with the typothetae    were a notable contribution  p  ingelist of prtig de vinne was an evangelist of printing during his lifetime he contributed nearly seventy articles to periodicals many of these were brief but some were quite extensive one for example speed in composition  was actually twelve separate articles tracing the history of attempts to increase speed of composition de vinne articles were almost equally divided between those in trade publications and those for the general public the former primarily concerned technical matters the adaptability of paper  trade conditions the tariff on types  low prices and ruinous competition  questions of taste and style head bands and tail pieces  fads in typography  and some historical articles william caxton  the latter primarily concerned stylistic matters some comments on the imitator of william morris  attractiveness in books  and historical matters john gutenberg  the first editor  etc but there were also occasional articles on technical and labor matters the printing of the century  cooperation  there was a great deal that de vinne wished to write but had not accomplished before he died unfinished tasks included a more complete history of typefaces and at least one more volume as a supplement to his practice of typography on the planning of books and on the typographic treatment of particular topics in his last years he urged henry l bullen to undertake the latter because he knew he himself could not  de vinne did more than any other person to make the public and the scholar aware of the problems of the printer he imposed upon himself the job of being a public relations man for the printing trade he availed himself of every opportunity to explain his trade to the public by writing and by lecturing he continually tried to uplift the public taste in typographical matters making more effort for this cause than any american before or since perhaps even more important however was the influence of his writings and his example upon the typographic taste of the trade a judgment it can be argued that de vinne was the greatest american printer and that he exerted probably the greatest influence of any one man upon american printing no one else has had such a great effect upon both the technology and typography of his time no one else has been so successful in conveying his ideas to his fellow printers no one else was so highly regarded by his contemporaries in the trade de vinne work stands in sharp contrast to the english work of william morris not so much because it aroused public interest but because it pointed in the direction which the course of printing would follow marshall lee makes the distinction between morris and de vinne nicely rapid expansion had an unfortunate effect upon typographic development where the hand printer was confined to a few basic typefaces and therefore simple typography the machine age printer had type of every descrip
de vinne and the de vinne press  tion and many that defied description the result beginning at mid century was typographic chaos about  a reaction set in against machine made monstrosities in england william morris revived the handicrafts of medieval bookmaking in amenca a few scholar printers notably de vinne updike and rogers restored the typography of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries although no more inventive than morris this movement introduced the mature traditions of printing to machine technology and had a far greater effect  p  chronology comes to de vinne defense as an innovator his actions against the confusing mixture of typefaces began well before  and william morris the constructive contributions of updike and rogers originally much influenced by morris did not come until the twentieth century in addition to the importance of his many particular contributions de vinne is significant because of his uniquely successful spanning of what to other printers have been dichotomies no other printer certainly no other printer of modern times who has had such an interest in fine printing and typographic style and in the historical and antiquarian aspects of his craft ever possessed such technological knowledge and seized upon technological innovation so wholeheartedly as did de vinne he demonstrated as has no other and at a crucial time that one could embrace and even contribute to the new technology without abandoning either typographic traditions or concern for style and the values of aesthetics nor has any other printer of modern times combined such stylistic values and historical interests with such an awareness of the proper role of print as communication with such a realization and exploitation of the potentialities of printing as mass communication de vinne through the form of the magazine led quality printing into the realm of mass circulation which it had never penetrated before finally no other printer of modern times has combined such stylistic values and historical interests with such commercial success de vinne demonstrated that fine printing need not be limited to the domain of the private press or the small press of deliberately limited scope dedication to typographic and aesthetic values could be demanded of the most commerical establishment these are significant and major contributions for they demonstrate that these dichotomies are not so unbridgable as one might otherwise suppose and these contributions are all in one way or another unique to de vinne references  de vinn daniel recollections of fifty years in the ministry new york n tibbals  co   devinne daniel the methodist episcopal church and slavery new york francis hart  co   de vinnc daniel the irish primitive church new york francis hart  co   the business printer salt lake city utah porte publishing co may   lehmann haupt hellmut the book in america d ed new york r r bowker co   quarterly illustrator vol  december   bullen henry lewis biographical sketch in theodore low de vinne printer new york privately printed   weeks edward the schooling of an editor in bowker lectures on book publishing new york r r bowker co   mott frank luther a history of american magazines vol    cambridge mass harvard university press
