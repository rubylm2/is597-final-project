 journal of education for library and information science hort tallman and fitzgerald noted that a face to face class received more tips on assignment completion than an online class one of the most difficult issues with online teaching has been to make the clarity of assignments such that students understand what they need to do face to face classes provide instructor access for explaining modeling and rewording assignments for people who need the support online it had to come through the virtual office hour chats or via individual e mail and discussion board communication and example assignments from previous classes this meant students had to take more responsibility in letting the instructor know of their problems not easy for many students this was partially true for this study the parts of the rubrics that graded technical or logistical aspects of the assignments ie if they were completed correctly found no significant difference differences occurred in the areas where students were expected to reflect to draw conclusions or to relate their work in the assignment to the instructional program of the school in the facilities project the evaluation of the current facility must be related to the instructional activities that occurred in the library in the budget the instructional justifications for each budget item were to do the same in the grantwriting the content of the grant must reflect the impact of the grant on the school and community it is probable that the ff class received more assistance in developing an approach to the assignments that helped them move beyond descriptive writing to analysis and reflection limitations the current gold standard in educational research is the use of true experiments to determine differences in instructional approaches however there are relatively few studies that can employ this research design due to the real world problems with randomly selecting students to participate in courses and randomly assigning them to different treatments for this study we would have had to randomly select potential slms candidates from three geographical areas in virginia and then randomly assign them to online and face to face programs this is just not feasible therefore we employed the next best research design in which we allowed candidates to self select themselves into the program and treatment groups yet we controlled for other factors that may have affected their performance we included powerful predictors including how they performed in their undergraduate studies raceethnicity and gender although we included powerful predictors the r statistic in our regression analyses indicates that we have not fully specified our models this means that there may be other independent factors that affected student performance that we did not measure in our models however the r statistics are certainly large enough for us to feel confident that we have accurate and robust predictors of student performance and have successfully determined if there are differences between online and face to face delivery one threat to the internal validity of the research study concerns the possible influence of the instructor who was aware of the research study and is
a comparison of online and face to face cohorts  one of the authors of this paper although the instructor attempted to keep the instruction strictly parallel in the two classes it is possible that subconsciously she favored one or the other sections we employed some systems to minimize such bias in interviews with the instructor after the course was completed another author attempted to locate bias and was not able to find evidence that one section was favored over another the assessments were graded with scoring rubrics we asked a professional in the field with decades of teaching experience to ensure that the rubrics were    well written and organized  detailed in terms of content so that all necessary content was sampled  detailed in terms of achievement descriptions ie what constituted excellent compared to very good work and  detailed in terms of point distributions in email correspondence the reviewer indicated that the rubrics would allow reasonably objective assessment of students and that the rubrics appear to be specific enough to allow a fair comparison of the results of their use in future studies we hope to establish systems of overlapping grading to establish inter rater reliability because this was an exploratory study we did not have these processes in place likewise the students in both sections were aware that their performance would be recorded as part of a research study this could have resulted in some form of hawthorne effect in one or both of the sections even though the study has limitations in terms of design it is certainly a step forward in the illumination of the delivery of slms training programs indeed our preliminary findings suggest that further research is necessary for example there may be ways to strengthen the delivery of project based instruction through distance education by increasing communication or revamping written descriptions of projects these interventions need to be assessed we plan on extending our research to other online courses in the program and strengthening the research design with reliability checks and although our findings suggest that project based learning is more difficult to deliver through de versus ff our findings are preliminary and should not be overgeneralized recommendations in this study we found no significant differences in student content knowledge between the two delivery methods we did find however that the two cohorts performed differently on certain project components thus our recommended changes to the course concern the interaction between students and the instructor these include offering greater assistance in interpreting the rubrics for each assignment and more interaction with students while they are completing the assignment we suggest using the announcements page on the online course to call student attention to parts of the rubrics and instructor postings reminding students of the types of reflection needed for a target level project most significantly we suggest that online instruction may be a viable mechanism for delivering slms training to underserved areas of the
