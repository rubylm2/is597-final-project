by any criteria the thomas jefferson building of the library of congress  is one of the more significant public structures in all of american architecture a distinction due more to its wealth and quality of decoration than to any architectural preeminence adopting aesthetic principles espoused by the french ecole des beauxarts the builders and decorators of the congressional library created one of the most ambitious and sophisticated decorative programs of the american renaissance  articulating for the first time a coordinated national iconography symbolic of americas emerging role in the advancement of western culture this study will briefly examine a significant component of the librarys extensive decoration its sculptural program and discuss the aesthetic and functional meanings of select sculptures both in relation to the overall decorative program of the building and within a larger cultural context in june  congress had appointed a joint select committee senator daniel w vorhees of indiana chair to resolve the decadelong controversy regarding additional accommodations for the congressional library  p  six years later congress approved an act providing for the construction of a new library building  p  the act stipulated that the building be erected according to the renaissancestyle plans submitted by john l smithmeyer  and that a commission composed of the secretary of the interior the architect of the capitol extension and the librarian of congress superintend the work the commission appointed smithmeyer as architect his partner paul j pelz  as assistant architect and bernard r green  as superintendent and engineer apparently motivated by a desire to economize congress approved a second act in october  repealing the provision that the building be constructed according to smithmeyers plans and disbanding the commission  p  instead the new act placed the work under the sole control of the chief of engineers of the army brig general thomas lincoln casey  and required him to prepare new plans subject to the approval of the secretary of war and the secretary of the interior that would keep the total cost of the buildings construction under  exclusive of previous appropriations within a few months of his appointment casey presented to congress a modification of smithmeyers original designs revising the ground plan and various other architectural features but maintaining the full dimensions of the building based on caseys report the act under whose authority the library would be constructed was finally passed by congress on march   it directed that caseys modified plan be adopted and that the building be erected at a total cost not to exceed  exclusive of any appropriations already made  p  there were no provisions for sculptural or mural decoration following caseys appointment in october  he placed green in charge of the office of building for library of congress located at  east capitol street making him responsible under the generals authority for the design and construction of the building  pp  in the fall of  with the construction of the library nearly half completed general caseys son edward pearce casey  of new york was appointed to design most of the important interior architecture and to coordinate the buildings decoration the majority of the figurative sculpture for the congressional library would be modeled approved executed and installed between  and  without question the sculptural decoration of the library of congress is indebted to general casey who on his own authority chose to absorb the costs of the program within the original monies allotted for the construction of the building a decision not without some risk given the centurylong disinclination of congress to allow funds appropriated for federal building projects to be used for decorative purposes but general casey and the supervising architects he appointed sincerely believed that special sculptures and mural paintings were essential to fully and consistently carry out the monumental design and purpose of the building  p  casey also believed that the decorative programs being essential to the functional success of the building required no further appropriations or approval from congress other than that already given in the original appropriation in fact casey entered into the contracts for the statuary of the main reading room without even the prior knowledge of congress  p  general casey and his son entrusted the execution of the extensive sculptural program of the library of congress to a committee of three prominent american sculptorsjohn quincy adams ward  olin levi warner  and augustus saintgaudens  the committee advised the architects on the selection and assignment of each sculptor approved sketch models and final designs and generally assumed aesthetic responsibility for the buildings sculptural decoration  while questions of aesthetic quality were usually left to the art jury it was edward caseys responsibility as coordinator of a veritable army of sculptors and painters to insure a consistency of handling from one sculpture to the next and between sculptures and paintings in close proximity to one another in practical terms caseys task was to maintain a uniform scale style degree of relief and patina or coloration between related sculptures often needing to reconcile differences of opinion and temperament between one artist and another when disputes arose the prestige and diplomatic skills of the general were usually brought to bear both caseys held veto power over the appointment of sculptors and the details of the program but only rarely did they overrule the sculpture jury or make an important decision without their informed consent the sculptural commissions awarded in connection with the library of congress and the appointment of a jury of artists to help insure the aesthetic integrity of the work assumed considerable significance for the members of the newly formed national sculpture society nss in  one of the main purposes for organizing the nss in the first place had been to establish in the united states as already existed in europe a competent authority with regard to public art matters thus the society was excited and much encouraged by general caseys request for a committee of sculptors to oversee the decorations for the new national library on january   the first official meeting between general casey and the advisory panel of sculptors was held at the office of building for the library of congress in washington also in attendance was superintendent of construction green casey informed the artists that approximately  was available to cover that part of the work to be furnished by sculptors the group then laid out the sculptural requirements for the building the more significant commissions included three pairs of bronze doors for the buildings main west entrance for the main reading room a great clock eight plaster female personifications to surmount the piers and for the balustrades of the gallery level sixteen bronze historical portraits the specific orders for sculpture to decorate the library of congress were sent out between february  and july  nearly one hundred individual reliefs busts statues and assorted figures in bronze plaster and wood were commissioned from over thirty sculptors in the case of the marble relief sculptures for the great hall designed by philip martiny and olin levi warner the sculptors would supply the models and the actual marbles would be carved in place by government stone carvers on the other hand each sculptor of a statue for the main reading room was responsible personally for having the final figure cast in bronze historical portraits or plaster female personifications and delivered to the building in washington upon delivery each statue would be hoisted into place by the government with only a few exceptions all of the works were completed and in place when the building officially opened on november   the sculpture of the library of congress as part of the overall decoration of the building affirms the fundamental jeffersonian belief inherited from the enlightenment that public access to accumulated knowledge is essential to the integrity of a free and democratic society also central to the buildings iconography is the idea ultimately platonic in origin that the acquisition of knowledge and wisdom is in and of itself an essentially moral endeavor common themes formally expressed through myth allegory and historical portraiture include the diversity of nations and cultures contributing to human progress philip martinys the four continents the lifelong pursuit and practical application of knowledge olin warners the students the cultivation of wisdom as a civilizing influence elihu vedders minerva the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next olin warners oral tradition and individual exemplary achievement in law government science and the arts the historical portrait statuary of the main reading room perhaps most significantly the complex iconography of the librarys extensive sculpture and painting also addressed an apparent cultural need to position americas postcivil war maturation within a meaningful international and historical context generally speaking the decorators of the library of congress operated under the tenets of the american renaissance that cultural episode in the nations history spanning the period from the centennial  to americas entry into world war i  essentially conservative and didactic in nature confident and often intensely nationalistic the art and architecture of the american renaissance reflected the growing social and political stature of the united states throughout the late nineteenth century in the wake of unprecedented material growth and an increasingly rapid social expansion american renaissance ideology while professing optimism in the future preferred to emphasize a sense of continuity with the past seeking out examples of reasonable and progressive change from the history of human development to serve as societal models for future cultural advancement key stylistic and thematic traits of american renaissance art and architecture include a reliance on art historical sources from antiquity and the italian renaissance a belief in the social usefulness of art a concept that can be traced through french beauxarts theory to the early eighteenth century when leading enlightenment figures such as voltaire diderot and others sought to reestablish the prestige of the fine arts by arguing for their effectiveness as indispensable social instruments  p  and the unity of the primary arts painting sculpture and architecture another french beauxarts principle and a legacy of seventeenthcentury european architectural design many of the sculptors employed to decorate the library of congress made deliberate use of antique models herbert adamss plaster minervas for the consoles of the vestibule of the main entrance for example are inspired by ancient personifications of victory especially the hellenistic nike of samothrace ca  bce at the louvre a more imaginative use of sources can be seen in john flanagans statuary for the reading room clock here flanagan draws his general composition and iconography from renaissance and baroque funerary chapel decorations such as michelangelos medici tombs for the new sacristy of san lorenzo in florence  and gian lorenzo berninis tombs of urban viii  and alexander vii  for saint peters in rome but the american renaissance sculptor in keeping with the conceptual demands of his commission inventively transforms the traditional funerary themes of temporal existence and the human struggle for the divine into a more rational discourse on the benefit of accumulated knowledge over time one of the buildings most eloquent expressions of american renaissance methods and sensibilities is olin warners oral tradition fig  a bronze lunette for the north doors of the librarys original main entrance a seated mother and child group personifying the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next and stylistically reflecting the influence of michelangelo occupies the center of the composition it is flanked on either side by representatives of four premodern races who kept their lore alive through oral tradition a stone age man a norseman a shepherd and a native american fig  olin levi warner oral tradition ca  bronze lunette over one of the main entrance doors thomas jefferson building library of congress washington dc courtesy of library of congress in theme and composition oral tradition is a late nineteenthcentury american secularized version of the italian renaissance sacra conversazione holy conversation giovanni bellinis san giobbe altarpiece ca  is a good example of this type which brings together saints from different epochs in the history of the church who in relaxed company with the enthroned virgin and child interact with each other and with the audience while no longer christian in context warners oral tradition nevertheless retains the ethical character of its antecedent by affirming a belief in the brotherhood of all races and the dignity of human endeavor and the social meanings invested in the image resonate that much deeper as a result of the formats inclusive nature which extends the fictive boundaries of the work of art in order to encourage the viewer to engage more directly with the seemingly worldlike community of sacred beings thus warners use of sources like flanagans is neither superficial nor simply structural but instead denotes a pattern of visual reference that is linked organically to the artists intentions this kind of imitation or emulation a stylistic legacy of the italian renaissance and typical of american renaissance art reflects the sculptors admiration even reverence for the past but also embodies a competitive component that is the desire to overreach his predecessors in an evolutionary sense by reinterpreting traditional formulas in light of the new cultural imperatives of modern american experience  pp  most interestingly perhaps warners relief as a depiction of race reveals a moral progression when compared to similar american sculptures from earlier in the century such as thomas crawfords the progress of civilization  the pediment for the north senate wing of the us capitol building crawfords pediment illustrates the progress of civilization on the north american continent from a primitive savage state viewers right represented by the taming of the wilderness and the extinction of the american indian to a more advanced condition of cultivation and material progress viewers left it is a bold statement of the doctrine of manifest destiny an idea central to american thought at midcentury  p  one of crawfords pedimental figures dying indian chief in particular reflects the prevailing american belief at the time that native american peoples contributed nothing to the advancement of human knowledge or technology and therefore existed outside the progress of western culture the subsequent demise of native americans therefore was tragic but inevitable warners lunette in strong contrast to crawfords figure promotes the common american renaissance notion that modern civilized institutions are actually rooted in aboriginal cultures and that the entire human family has contributed to the general progress of civilization locating oral tradition in a lunette over one of the main entrance doors to the building recalls the similar placement of sculptural reliefs typically last judgment scenes in romanesque and gothic cathedrals in fact the original alignment of the interior of the thomas jefferson building beginning at the three western doors and extending eastward along a strong central axis clearly reflects the traditional axial or basilican plan of western christian churches today the library is no longer entered through the main doors but from a visitors center one floor below the great hall the librarys axis directs the visitor from the vestibule into the great hall through a commemorative arch patterned after the arch of titus in rome ca  ce and into the main reading room or rotunda which replaces the christian choir and altar as the sacredsecular focus of the building the scheme even features the requisite altarpiece the heroic mosaic of minerva by elihu vedder located along the axis at the upperstory gallery level entrance to the rotunda derived from earlier greek sources such as the celebrated statue of athena lemnia by phidias midfifth century bce the roman minerva guardian of wisdom and protector of civilization celebrates in its new american renaissance context rationality the rule of law and the unfettered access to accumulated human knowledge intellectual cornerstones of a modern enlightened republic returning to the great hall the visitor entering the room from the vestibule is flanked to the north and south by grand staircases leading to the upper story decorated with multiple figures and figural groups designed by philip martiny on the newel posts at the base of each railing are two bronze lampbearers distant cousins of the statue of liberty liberty enlightening the world  by frédéric auguste bartholdi martinys lampbearers illuminate the library visitors personal journey along the path toward truth and enlightenment most of the spaces on the ascending railings are occupied by cherublike marble figures in high relief representing various careers or occupations that late nineteenthcentury americans would be likely to pursue including among others a mechanic hunter farmer fisherman printer musician physician and astronomer fig  images typical of the populism of the progressive era martinys cherubs draw attention to the populist notion that the educated american worker is the true source of the nations power and wealth a similar theme is picked up again in edwin h blashfields allegorical figure of america from his evolution of civilization the collar painting for the ceiling of the main reading room fig  dressed as a mechanic and endowed with the facial features of abraham lincoln blashfields figure evokes the cult of the selfmade man the fundamentally american idea that through hard work and initiative material success is within reach of any american regardless of the potentially limiting conditions into which he or she was born fig  view of the great hall showing a bronze lampbearer and some of the marble figures decorating the rail of

directly at the spot along the central axis of the building where the visitor would enter the great hall from the vestibule in other words with the original entrance to the library in mind martiny

marble south ascending rail great hall thomas jefferson building library of congress washington dc courtesy of library of congress the librarys sculptural program reaches its apex in the main reading room the functional and symbolic center of the building the program is composed of eight plaster personifications for the main piers each representing a prominent feature in the intellectual or material life of the west art history commerce religion science law poetry and philosophy with sixteen corresponding bronze historical portraits at the gallery level two for each allegorical statue celebrating exemplary individual achievements within each symbolic category for example statues of homer and shakespeare flank poetry statues of columbus and robert fulton flank commerce and so on the task of selecting the subjects for the statuary of the main reading room fell to the librarian of congress ainsworth rand spofford mr spofford the librarian who it is said can tell what is inside a volume by looking at its covers was authorized to settle the momentous question subjects for the rotundas statuary and has been reflecting over it for more than three years he realizes that there will be a great deal of criticism of his choice  the subjects for these mr spofford has selected as follows poetry homer and shakespeare art michelangelo and beethoven science newton and henry history herodotus and gibbon philosophy plato and bacon commerce columbus and fulton law solon and blackstone religion moses and st paul  the final statues were executed as described except that the blackstone was replaced by chancellor kent spofford also chose the famous authors to be represented by the nine granite busts filling the exterior niches on the west facade of the buildingfranklin demosthenes dante irving macaulay sir walter scott emerson hawthorne and goethe  the rotunda statuary and their respective sculptors are as follows art françois michel louis tonettidozzi after sketches by augustus saintgaudens michelangelo paul wayland bartlett beethoven theodore baur history daniel chester french herodotus daniel chester french gibbon charles henry niehaus commerce john

macmonnies philosophy bela l pratt plato john j boyle bacon john j boyle the rotundas statuary enhances the rooms significance as the primary site for the transfer of knowledge the active point of intersection between past present and future historical time it is here that the modern visitor obtains direct access to the printed record of human civilization the intellectual raw material necessary to fuel the steady progress of western culture but the space also assumes a commemorative monumentality that transcends its literal function as a reading room with its pantheonlike circular dome and its gallery of honorific sculpture a secular equivalent to the saints portrayed on the facades of gothic cathedrals the rotunda aspires to be in metaphorical terms a national temple dedicated to the history of ideas and to the memory of those individuals whose exceptional intellect or genius contributed to the lasting benefit of humankind domed structures are commonly memorial and pedagogic in character since they are meant to instruct posterity regarding what is worth remembering from the past still the pantheon idea has persisted throughout western architectural history largely because of the universality of its symbolism it is a monumental form on any scale because of its bold and simple geometry  permanence is expressed by the centered dome the shape most suggestive of fixed and immutable rules because its unbroken encircling sphericity evokes the stability of the firmament itself  a domed rotunda is a place where one can partake symbolically of the immutable laws and hopedfor tranquility of the universe  a pantheon is neither sacred nor secular but a place of man and nature of man and the forces the ancients called the gods  p  but domed libraries as a specific building type are rare before the nineteenth century and the earliest clear precedent for them is found in eighteenthcentury english baroque architecture  pp    p  sir christopher wren first introduced the freestanding circular library with his preliminary design for trinity college cambridge although wrens design was never built it inspired the radcliffe camera oxford  a circular domed library conceived by nicholas hawksmoor and built by james gibbs  pp   pp   other eighteenthcentury library designs that incorporated a central rotunda are etiennelouis boullées design for the bibliothèque du roi on the site of the capuchins  also never built and jnl durands only slightly more credible design for a library from his précis des leçons darchitecture vol   the closest american precedent for the domed reading room of the library of congress is thomas jeffersons own rotunda for the university of virginia charlottesville  itself inspired by the boulléedurand model additional early nineteenthcentury examples of the domed rotunda type include karl friedrich schinkels design for the berlin staatsbibliothek  and sydney smirkes library for the british museum   pp   p  the primary distinction between the main reading room of the library of congress and these earlier domed designs is the extent to which painting and sculpture have been effectively integrated into the overall architectural composition a beauxarts inspired unification of the arts that is unprecedented in american architectural history although ultimately baroque in origin the most direct precursor to the rotundas sculptural program particularly the bronze historical portrait statuary that graces the rooms gallery is the eighteenthcentury european cult of great men erecting monuments to venerate exceptional poets scholars and philosophers was common practice during ancient times and an important component in the antique revivals of the late medieval and renaissance periods the postrenaissance tradition of honorific sculpture begins in the early enlightenment and is closely linked with the developing concept of the genius in the modern sense as an individual endowed with native and transcendent intellectual or artistic power and with the growing belief at the time in the potential social value of public sculpture  p  diderot and the encyclopedists had credited the fine arts with morally redemptive qualities especially portrait sculpture of great men whose actions were the result of enlightened thought the value of sculpture lay in the moral influence which it could exercise like history sculpture was a durable record of what men had done  considering sculpture from a moral viewpoint its worthy objective was to perpetuate the memory of illustrious men and thus provide models of virtue for mankind  p  the eighteenthcentury emphasis on individual accomplishment over religious piety or the privileges of birth as the basis for recognizing moral or social virtue further reinforced the acceptance of the portrait statue as a legitimate artistic expression as the century progressed ambitious civic programs featuring honorific statuary placed within grand architectural settingsimportant precedents for the library of congressbecame an increasingly prominent species of monument an early english example is william kents temple of british worthies  for lord cobhams garden at stowe buckinghamshire an exedrastyle structure the temple incorporates sixteen busts of famous englishmen as a group the worthies gaze toward the nearby temple of ancient virtue also designed by kent a domed building originally containing the statues of homer socrates epaminondas and lycurgus four famous greeks who represented the ultimate achievement in the fields of poetry philosophy military science and law the juxtaposition of the two buildings symbolized the hope that history would one day admit the favored britains into the honored company of the ancients  p  in france late century egalitarian and revolutionary ideologies confirmed a nearly universal faith in the cult of great men the most sweeping sculptural program commissioned in the eighteenth century to honor the great men of france is the series of twentyseven statues ordered by count dangiviller beginning in  to adorn the grand gallery of the louvre choosing subjects from french history since the middle ages dangiviller sought to arouse patriotic feelings and promote interest in the origins of modern france by extolling past french genius  p  later proposals dedicated specifically to french heroes of the revolution include charles de waillys projected design for the alteration of sainte genevièvetransformed into the panthéon in which replaced the churchs dome with a circular colonnade crowned with statues and the boulléeinspired design for a temple décadaire by durand and thibault likewise topped by a row of statuebearing columns  p  reflecting the postenlightenment intellectualization of morality such monuments define a modern tradition of commemorative public sculpture to which the library of congress rotunda statues also belong sharing rational moral and patriotic impulses regarding the possibilities of sculpture each program enlists historical portraiture in the cause of national and cultural progress hypostatizing the ultimate perfectibility of human nature through education and the application of the mind where the american program diverges from the eighteenthcentury formula is in its conception of national identity in other words while the english and french models celebrate the genius of a single nation the statuary for the congressional library in washington in keeping with the more expansive multicultural heritage embraced by the american renaissance draws its subjects from the entire history of human civilization most turnofthecentury american critics agreed that paul wayland bartletts two bronze historical portraits for the main reading room columbus and michelangelo fig  were among the finest works of art created for the national library especially the michelangelo which many hailed as a genuine american masterpiece regarding his commissions for the library of congress bartlett had decided from the outset to produce the best work possible rather than simply conform to the restrictive deadlines and standardized specifications imposed by the federal officials in charge of the buildings construction this was particularly true for the michelangelo which he clearly considered one of the more significant commissions of the entire decorative program bartletts careful methodical approach to his work led to considerable delays and when the librarys main reading room officially opened to readers on the first of november  neither of his bronze statues had yet been completed much to the chagrin of superintendent green michelangelo in fact the last of the reading room statuary to be installed was not hoisted into position until christmas day  fig  paul wayland bartlett michelangelo  bronze main reading room library of congress washington dc courtesy of library of congress bartlett designed michelangelo in light of the fact that the dominant view of the statue would be frontal and from the floor of the rotunda some  feet below thus bartlett modeled the statue so as to be visually accessible at a distance the head for example is enlarged in relation to the torso lengthened vertically by the beard and made more massive horizontally by the eared cap that the sculptor wears also the eyebrows are exaggerated creating deep shadows out from which piercing eyes gleam effectively in modeling the clothed figure bartlett left singularly plain those parts less important in revealing the bodys construction while such points of articulation as knees shoulders elbows and waist are clearly delineated through distinct angular folds within the clothing  pp  but while bartlett carefully considered the particular conditions under which michelangelo would be viewed he refused to allow those conditionsor the stipulations of his contract for that matterto determine his conception of the subject so in contrast to the majority of rotunda statuary bartlett neither inclined michelangelos head downward toward the rotunda floor nor moved the statue forward on the plinth in fact michelangelo stands back and to the left so that one foot is actually moving off the rear of the plinth and in direct abnegation of his contract bartlett made both michelangelo and columbus larger than specified clearly intending that his figures dominate in size as well as spirit the other portrait statues in the room faithfully following the best historical evidence regarding the renaissance masters less than heroic appearance bartlett represented michelangelo as neither of great stature nor particularly handsome having been disfigured by a broken nose that had never properly healed nevertheless the statue transcends the merely descriptive to evoke with remarkable immediacy michelangelos restless creative intensity most of the other bronze portrait statues in the rotunda are competent but conservative variations on ancient greek and roman prototypes individualized or modernized by the addition of traditional attributes and costume by contrast bartlett achieved a monumental effect with michelangelo by adopting a more progressive romantic naturalism and bolder surface treatment innovations originally introduced into bronze historical portrait statuary earlier in the century by the french sculptor pierrejean david dangers  davids thomas jefferson  fig  from the rotunda of the us capitol building initiated a modern tradition of portrait statuary to which bartletts michelangelo belongs in its clean break with the international classicism that still dominated french sculpture during the first quarter of the nineteenth century a daring departure from the aloof classical guise typical of enlightenmentera portraiture jefferson characterizes a historical portrait type invented by david in which traditional allegory is rejected in favor of naturalism modern dress and readable commonsense attributes furthermore the relaxed open distribution of limbs more vigorous modeling and flickering surface textures of jefferson davids first statue planned from the start for bronze rather than marble  pp  reveals that the sculptor had learned how to take advantage of the new medium to render a fresher more engaging image of a contemporary statesman fig  pierrejean david dangers thomas jefferson  bronze rotunda us capitol building gift of uriah p levy usn  but the significance of davids thomas jefferson for bartletts michelangelo goes well beyond a general stylistic inheritance the american sculptor consciously emulated the stance pose and gestures of the jeffersonlaterally reversedthereby directly linking the two figures indulging in a kind of reverse historical appropriation bartlett apparently intended a conceptualization of michelangelo as a renaissance prefigurement of jefferson or more to the point of certain jeffersonian or american enlightenment ideals such as a belief in the intellect as the source of inspiration and the conversion of the ideal into the practical the stylistically progressive character of michelangelo which holds its own even when measured against the latest trends in contemporary french sculpture helps to explain the statues success among late nineteenthcentury american critics however another and perhaps more compelling reason for the broad positive response to bartletts statue is its decidedly democratic workingclass character that is bartlett depicts michelangelo not as a powerful figure sought after by popes and men of wealth but rather as a common laborer chisel in hand informally dressed in studio cap and apron pausing to reflect on some work in progress the entrepreneurial somewhat lowbrow justanotherworkingday characterization of the great renaissance sculptor was immediately recognized as one of the statues most salient features in famous sculptors of america  j walker mcspadden explains that the statue aroused much discussion when first put in place because it showed the great master as an ordinary workman rather than some lofty and remote personage it made him human a toiler with chisel and mallet as he undoubtedly was  p  and charles dekay remarked at the time of its installation that bartletts michelangelo is the figure of the workman first of all and only secondary that of the sculptor further noting that he seems to have had no greater satisfaction within the bounds of all his vast horizons than the satisfaction in work  this kind of acclaim accorded bartletts michelangelo immediate and nearly unanimous invites an examination of the statue within a larger cultural context for example bartletts workoriented progressiveminded characterization of michelangelo easily attached itself to the broadly popular contemporary arts and crafts movement which in response to the growing threats of industrialization and machine production to the security and well being of the common worker celebrated individual human achievement and the handmade versus the factorymade object inspired by the english arts and crafts movement and the ideas of john ruskin  and william morris  the american movement centered in the towns of upstate new york also championed enjoyable purposeful and dignified manual labor as the basis for a new more humanistic social order charles eliot norton harvards first professor of fine arts and a close friend of william morris preached a similar victorian moral aesthetic to his primarily new england audience writing in  that doggedness in the doing of work was the hallmark of arts and crafts societies norton like ruskin and morris associated honest labor with moral worth insisting that the artistic style of a given period was linked to social and moral character  the first to promote william morriss ideas on a national level in the united states and one of the principal founders of the arts and crafts movement in america was elbert hubbard  nationally prominent publisher and founder of the community of the roycrofters in east aurora new york hubbard had visited morriss crafts center at hammersmith england in  and inspired by what he had seen there hoped to establish a similar community in east aurora part utopian part entrepreneurial his roycroft community quickly became well known for its high quality products its popular publications and its handsome profits deriving his ideas from ruskin morris and the english evolutionist herbert spencer  hubbard gave them a particularly american slant grafting them onto the strong individualist tradition in american thought the selfhelp doctrine and the profit motive hubbard like ruskin and morris also believed that work should have meaning and that people should learn from and enjoy their labor  p  mans business is to work he wrote to surmount difficulties to endure hardship to solve problems to overcome the inertia of his own nature  p  in late january  hubbard saw bartletts michelangelo for the first time and immediately interpreted the figure as a visual embodiment of arts and crafts ideology much taken with the statue hubbard not only wrote and published a short essay on the figure but also quickly sent the sculptor a personal request for a copy your statue of michael angelo is the biggest thing i know of it is tremendous in its strength and poise it stands for all that the roycroft stands for and i would very much like a copy of it to place in the roycroft shop  hubbards essay entitled he faces the east was published in the form of a fourpage pamphlet and included a color woodcut of bartletts statue bartlett personally arranged with the gorham manufacturing company of providence rhode island for a fullscale bronze replica of michelangelo to be cast and sent to east aurora for erection on the roycroft community grounds charging hubbard only the foundrys cost in producing the statue the replica was originally erected in may  and stands today on the front lawn of the local high school in east aurora any aesthetic evaluation of the sculptural program for the thomas jefferson building of the library of congress must finally take note of the fact that the sculptorslike the mural painterswere asked to assume a subordinate role to that of the supervising architects vested by congress with ultimate responsibility for the building and its decoration the architects not only predetermined with the help of the librarian the subjects for most of the sculptures but also established detailed specificationsoften imposed by the architecture itselfgoverning the conduct of the commissions the sculptors lack of complete control over their own work was most evident with respect to the rotunda statuary where owing to the need for a uniform treatment throughout strict instructions were given regarding the height stance pose characterization and material composition of the figures the dominant position of the architect ran counter to the sculptors belief in the autonomy of the artist and the integrity of the creative process still most of them were willing to accept such a role believing their participation in the program would impact positively on their careers and on the future development of american sculpture in fact the mural and sculptural programs of the library of congress once established did influence the decorative schemes of numerous public buildings constructed in america during the early twentieth century including notably the new york state appellate court building  and the pennsylvania state capitol building  however by the end of world war i american renaissance ideology had been quickly and decisively undercut by the modernist agenda that effectively severed the majority of american artists from traditional cultural and art historical influences ultimately the only sculptor to benefit substantially from his involvement with the decoration of the congressional library was bartlett whose michelangelo provided a springboard for an incredibly successful career as a producer of major public monuments throughout the early decades of the twentieth century key works include integrity protecting the works of man  the sculpture for the pediment of the new york stock exchange produced in collaboration with john quincy adams ward the apotheosis of democracy  the sculpture for the house pediment of the us capitol building the six attic figures for the fifth avenue facade of the new york public library  his seated statue of benjamin franklin  for waterbury connecticut and especially his equestrian statue of lafayette  which was presented by america to france as a reciprocal gift for bartholdis statue of liberty  not coincidentally the maker of the michelangelo was among those few sculptors least concerned with conforming to the many restrictions imposed upon them by their library of congress commissions most of the sculptors took a more conscientious if less ambitious approach to their assignments choosing to satisfy the collaborative demands of the program rather than explore its idiosyncratic possibilities by creating pieces of sculpture whose real value should be measured in terms of their incremental impact within the entire decorative ensemble thereby suppressing the uniqueness of their own work in favor of the harmony and enhancement of the whole they helped to construct one of the most exceptionally decorated buildings in the history of american architecture   for more information on this important point see  p   for the basic literature on the librarys sculptural program which is not extensive see  pp  n    the committee was to consider the possibility of extending the capitol
