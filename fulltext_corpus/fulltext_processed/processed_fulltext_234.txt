the library quarterly volume  january  number  in a state of emergency libraries and government control in south africa christopher merrett six levels are identified in the south african censorship system providing the context for consideration of one of them the state of emergency four categories of censorship emerge prior censorship and suspension of publication restraints upon information gathering the suppression of anti apartheid viewpoints and the growth of militarization the state of emergency is seen as a microcosm of the system as a whole and a comparison is made with traditional censorship of books emergency censorship is considered to be a radical tactical change whose impact on library resources and research in the humanities and social sciences is evaluated in spite of the power and pervasiveness of the censorship system it is concluded that there is still room for challenge and that a new breed of librarian is likely to play an important role in the process introduction the south african censorship system is a massive and pervasive institution of such influence in society that it is generally considered in terms of its disaggregated parts the danger of this approach lies in the fact that censorship as an institution is forgotten the specific aspect under scrutiny gives a skewed perspective of the system in its entirety thus to some censorship conjures up a picture of books and periodicals under lock and key in the library for others the suspension or outright  deputy university librarian university of natal po box  pietermaritzburg south africa  library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved      
 the library quarterly banning of newspapers hostile to government ideology and to yet others the detention harassment through the legal process or assassination of those activists who provide oral and published accounts of the aims and aspirations of anti apartheid organizations many other images equally valid are possible but it is vital not to lose sight of the broader canvas which provides clues to the complex issue of government tactics the relative importance of censorship component parts at any given time however indicates changing official approaches and perceptions the system as a whole may be characterized as an inverted triangle comprising six layers ranging from the broadest at the top to the most specific at the bottom a fundamental means of censorship in south africa is the institutionalized system of economic and social exploitation known to the world as apartheid or separate development its aim is to perpetuate political control by that group designated white and in recent years it has attempted to make allies among middle class segments of other racially defined groups of south africans indian coloured and black the vast mass of the people of the country remain a powerless and impoverished proletariat either in urban areas or increasingly in rural slums from which labor is drawn as required   thus the economic structure of south africa keeps the mass of the people at a safe distance from the means to communicate and without the political power to begin to change the national political economy the next level involves education sometimes described as the greatest censor  p  state education has for decades been used for ideological purposes by the south african government  p  to reinforce the privileged position of whites and to control the social and political potential and economic utility of the black majority the inferiority of black education is demonstrated by the relative sums spent on white and black children the latest show that in  r  was spent on each white child the figures for those classified as indian and coloured were r  and r  respectively black children living in white areas had r  spent on them while the figures for the bantustans varied from a high of r  in bophuthatswana to a low of r  in lebowa  these figures give a quantitative indication of relative deprivation they have been given a graphic dimension by the soweto uprising of  and persistent school boycotts and stayaways ever since while the political economy denies access to the infrastructure of communications except of course that controlled by the government inferior education denies children the chance to develop their linguistic skills and potential for structured thought and persuasive reasoning taken together these two means of censorship constitute an oppressive structure which is specifically designed to deny to the mass of the people the means and ability to communicate their frustrations aspirations or
in a state of emergency  essential humanity to their fellow south africans a human right withheld because it poses a threat to the continued existence of apartheid for individual leaders and activists who escape these circumstances the government has erected an impressive array of security legislation aimed at silencing the individual right to communicate a complex set of statutes built around the suppression of communism act of  was centralized in the internal security act of  this legalizes a vast array of human rights infringements individuals may be banned from any activity involving communication and restricted to given areas a form of civic death individuals may be detained for interrogation as state witnesses or for preventive reasons and in such circumstances many thousands have been tortured mentally or physically organizations may be banned and their assets seized and publications such as newspapers similarly proscribed all of these measures imply broad forms of censorship and their frequent use has created a climate of fear and uncertainty which has partially achieved the aim of which censors in totalitarian states dream the self censored society the fact that the authorities have failed to achieve a convenient symbiosis between the threat of repressive legislation and quiescence of the critical is epitomized by the states of emergency declared under the public safety act of  the first was imposed on march   and lasted  days  the second was declared on july   and covered various parts of the country mainly in the transvaal and cape province until lifted on march    the respite lasted only until june   with the declaration of a national emergency which is still in effect at the time of writing  and which some observers maintain can never be lifted by the present regime the state of emergency has a number of purposes encapsulated in the winning hearts and minds wham strategy to buy the compliance of radicalized communities through material improvement to isolate and destroy popular political organizations by detaining leaders and activists thus raising to unacceptable levels the price of anti apartheid involvement and to place in officially approved political structures compliant black politicians more amenable to a future without fundamental change the successful prosecution of such policies requires a severe level of censorship in order to prevent the circulation inside and outside the country of evidence of the means used by the south african government to put down the popular revolt which grew from the vaal uprising at sebokeng on september    in effect the state of emergency is an admission of failure and weakness beneath a facade of kragdadigheid its censorship provisions  an afrikaans word which translates as forcefulness in a political context it means ironfistedness and relates to steamroller tactics
 the library quarterly and their effect on library collections and intellectual activity form the central investigation of this article a fifth level of censorship is embodied in statutes which address specific segments of south africa economy and society and restrict the flow of information to that provided or endorsed by official spokespersons innovative reporters and commentators willing to risk criminal proceedings occasionally find loopholes in the legislation but in general it is true to say that nothing may be published on the police prisons oil supply uranium nuclear energy defense post mortem proceedings national supplies procurement or national keypoints without official sanction the prohibition of information and laws on cooperation and development acts of  tightened the grip of the authorities upon information about government policies and activities this body of legislation has the specific purpose of distorting the information system of the country and creating a skewed model which not only denies factual data to the population at large but also inhibits the development of ideas and paves the way for the acceptance of government propaganda and misinformation  pp   the government is also withholding more information from the public two recent examples involve detailed tourism figures and ship movements details of which are no longer published because of economic sanctions finally two statutes the publications act of  and the internal security act of  provide for the banning of specific bodies of literature the proscription of which has had a significant impact upon political discourse and academic activity the details have been reported elsewhere   but a summary completes this description of south african state censorship the publications act proscribes titles some of which are deemed possession prohibited the internal security act bans all the work of banned and listed persons numbering  in august   works published by or disseminating the policy of illegal organizations possession prohibited and titles deemed to promote the aims of communism also possession prohibited large libraries including all academic libraries hold blanket permits enabling them to lend material which does not fall into possession prohibited categories to students and academics provided the titles are normally held under  the distinction between listed and banned persons is important listed persons many of whom are political exiles generally belong to a proscribed organization like the south african communist party congress of democrats or congress of south african students they may not be quoted and listing may extend beyond the life of an individual banned persons have specific restrictions placed on them for defined periods and banning orders expire with the death of an individual the banned category has been largely superseded by restriction orders issued under the emergency except for a group of people convicted of treason
in a state of emergency  lock and key a register of usage and a separate catalog are kept consultation takes place under supervision photocopies are not made and only staff and postgraduates remove them from the library in the case of the works of banned and listed persons access is denied altogether to undergraduates and quoting is forbidden while the police have a statutory right to monitor the state of the collection the mere possession of such banned material is not an offense but importation retail circulation display or continued printing or publication is forbidden restricting acquisition and usage to the large libraries the material which falls into the three possession prohibited categories may not be held by libraries without the specific permission of the directorate of publications or the director of security legislation as appropriate nor may researchers consult it without similar permission under the internal security act the state may demand a r  bond from new newspapers which it might in future have to ban the largest such deposit r  was requested in december  when the left wing afrikaans newspaper die vtye weekblad applied for registration article  the recently formed international censorship watchdog organization based in london estimates that at least ten new newspapers have been stillborn as a result of such sanctions  p  clearly the internal security act forms part of the state security infrastructure but so too does the publications act although it also deals with pornographic and blasphemous material a large measure of the publication act impact is felt by political publications in the period    percent of  original submissions were made by agents of the state such as customs and excise officers the police and officials of the directorate of publications and only  percent by publishers and the general public during the periods    and     percent of  titles submitted were found to be undesirable  there is at present a trend to lift bans on books mainly literary works academic treatises on marxism and dated sociopolitical analyses of south africa this does nothing to disguise the fact that much south african research has been exiled the general ability to understand south african society has been undermined areas of south africa are completely closed to research and self censorship and privatism have become the refuge of south african scholars confronted by real or apparent bibliographic dead ends in general it is reasonable to argue that the potential contribution of academics to society as a whole has been undermined and the social relevance of universities has been diminished   the south african library in cape town one of the country five copyright libraries has been in the forefront of the process of appealing to the publications appeal board to lift restrictions on such works see 
 the library quarterly censorship under the emergency such are the different facets of south african censorship from the general to the specific and the context within which to consider the censorship implications of the state of emergency this is important because the potential of some sections of the regulations has yet to be realized and an educated forecast can be made on the bases of state tactics and strategy in other areas of the censorship system the current national emergency regulations were first published on june    many sections especially those relating to the media or the detention of persons were subsequently overturned in whole or in part by the natal supreme court in particular most such liberal judgments were reversed by the appeal court in bloemfontein a body which tends to show a preference for the state perceived security needs at the expense of the individual and corporate civil rights of persons and groups opposing apartheid where the authorities have failed to win a case on appeal they have simply reworded the regulations at the point of the mandatory renewal of the emergency at midnight on june  of each year  or brought out new sets of regulations such as the media emergency regulations of august   the annual renewal thus represents a consolidation of proclamations under the public safety act and for the purpose of this article those gazetted on june   are regarded as operative censorship is both implicit and explicit in the emergency regulations four aspects emerge the most obvious being prior censorship and the suspension of publications restraints placed upon news gathering at source and the suppression of anti apartheid viewpoints the fourth aspect lies in the degree to which the emergency epitomizes the growing militarization of south african society a development which has implications for communication and resource building the clauses relevant to censorship are contained in the security and the media emergency regulations together with the schedule of restricted organizations prior censorship under the emergency it is prohibited to publish information on security force action restricted gatherings certain strikes and boycotts deemed subversive utterances of persons or officials of restricted organizations the circumstances treatment and release of detainees and advertisements published in respect of banned or restricted organizations the  the state has had to become more precise about its definition of subversive material in
in a state of emergency  determination of the state in this regard is indicated by the prohibition placed upon the publication of blank spaces and deletions which reflect the effect of the regulations and on the printing in a second title of material which would have appeared in a suspended publication exempted from these prohibitions are officials and members of government departments some of whom make their own use of the statements of restricted organizations parliament and the president council most judicial proceedings except those relating to detainees and significantly a bona fide library carrying out normal loan activity the government version of the news is released by a bureau of information set up on september   initially to present abroad a more palatable version of south african reality  p  in the opinion of some analysts the bureau of information is not only a manager of news but also an agent of repression because since june   it has been the sole source for reporting unrest the bureau typifies the belief that the key to the struggle for south africa is the control of information  p   p   thus louis nel deputy minister of information was able to put forward the view that south africa does not have censorship just a limitation on what can be reported  it is unlikely that a library will be prosecuted for circulating a publication containing prohibited information there are however more serious implications for libraries contained in the prohibited information clauses the state is attempting to erase from the documented record essential facts about contemporary south african society a matter of importance for future historians faced with gaps in published material these are likely to affect researchers interested in security force methods boycott campaigns and political detainees among more important aspects of south african sociopolitics the mainline commeraugust  the natal supreme court found only one of six definitions precise enough to be valid in law a decision which created temporary space for press freedom during the period september december  however it claimed it had identified  press reports with subversive content   p   in june  three newspapers star sowetan and weekly mail were warned that blank spaces and deletions could be construed as subversion by way of protest the editor of the sowetan wrote in his weekly column about a potato  talking with the anc published in johannesburg by the department of information in  quotes the south african communist party sacp nine times and the african national congress anc thirty four times  in the crisis of political legitimacy and economic decline in which the south african system finds itself boycott is an important nonviolent means of protest for antiapartheid south africans election boycotts have challenged the racist constitutional dispensation rent and service boycotts the financially exploitative nature of black local government and consumer boycotts white right wing city councils and black organizations believed to be collaborating with the system
 the library quarterly cial press has been effectively muzzled by these restrictions as well as by non emergency security legislation and a traditional caution born of conservative management and the pressures of advertising revenue since the early s there has developed however an alternative philosophy in the press which while operating under enormous constraints has had the courage to test and challenge these emergency regulations to the limit for example the actions of the security forces may not be reported but it has been possible to document the reactions of crowds in such a way that the informed reader understands quite clearly what has happened for example in a tear gas attack the alternative press has also tested the regulations by arguing that once the police have issued a daily unrest report newspapers may add their own information and interpretation in this way the alternative press has attempted to preserve for the historical record information about the condition of south africa by extending the tradition of confronting gray areas of security legislation with pro active and aggressive responses to the emergency regulations seizure under the state of emergency however the potential for creative interpretation of the law has been severely curtailed the authorities have general powers of entry search and seizure and specific power to seize publications or recordings such seizures became more common in  for example on july   police seized  copies of the learn and teach booklet the historic speech of nelson rolihiala mandela at the rivonia trial even though the speech is part of open court proceedings and the documented history of south africa excerpts had already been printed by two newspapers and the bureau of information in its propaganda pamphlet talking with the anc in the ensuing case in the rand supreme court mr justice gordon described the emergency as a super censor over the courts  on august  volume  number  of the weekly mail was seized followed by forty eight hours of silence before the police provided an explanation it was accused by the authorities of flouting the regulations concerning reporting of security force action and undermining conscription by covering the views of  a good example is contained in  similarly police cars are known as familiar yellow vehicles and the police themselves as people who may not be named because of the emergency regulations  this was rejected by the rand supreme court in a case following seizure of the weekly mail in august  it is not permissible to add facts or report a different version of events see 
in a state of emergency  conscientious objectors al qalam an anti apartheid nmuslim monthly last appeared in july  in late august  copies of the next edition were seized because they contained an advertisement supporting a boycott of the forthcoming municipal elections on october  al qalam was subjected to repeated raids and the confiscation of documents and photographs in september and october and has not been able to publish since a fourth seizure involved crisis news a western province council of churches publication of which  copies were impounded in august censorship by seizure was not unknown in pre emergency south africa but it has become a more frequently used tactic to suppress the publication of anti apartheid data and opinion on september   the power of seizure under the emergency was transferred from the department of home affairs to that of law and order in other words to the security police in the past such police powers under the internal security act could be challenged in court but under the emergency the judiciary has no power to intervene if the police have decided that the regulations have been breached at the time it was felt that this might indicate government impatience with the suspension process see below which had caused a certain amount of embarrassment through its slow processes inefficiency and ensuing dissension  with each new state of emergency or suspension elaborate procedures had to be re initiated and such bureaucracy it was suggested did not fit the image of quick firm decisive action favored by the security forces suspension it subsequently emerged that increased police powers were not to supplant the warning and suspension process since october  the minister of home affairs has issued a steady stream of warnings against periodical publications and suspended five of them under the emergency he has the power to prohibit the publication and production of named titles for up to three months in the case of a registered periodical and for six months when unregistered such a suspension is subject to two gazetted warnings and those warned have the right to make representations to the minister twelve publications have received a first warning so far as shown in table  eleven of them represent antiapartheid viewpoints and the twelfth was a far right publication which is no longer produced one of the ten has been silenced as its parent body the end conscription campaign was restricted in august  the purpose of this punitive power was seen at the outset by those likely to be affected as the restriction of reporting on the aims and activities of extra parliamentary organizations

in a state of emergency  and damned it to silence because it dared to reflect the violence of apartheid  because it gave a voice to the voteless majority  because it articulated the aspirations of millions of oppressed people  weekly mail expressed its support by publishing on its second page a reproduction of page  of the new nation which would have been published on march   had it not been for the suspension for three months one particular viewpoint on south african events was thus silenced in addition new nation learning nation supplement which promotes a radical interpretation of south african history and serializes courses in bookkeeping prose writing algebra and health was suppressed this puts forward a philosophy of education which challenges state education and is a valuable cumulating resource in the libraries of human rights and community organizations and trade unions the government next suspended south a cape town based newspaper for one month from may   its editor rashid seria had pointed out the obvious intention of the authorities to aim at the more peripheral of the alternative newspapers  although this action precipitated the international save the press campaign suspended newspapers have made constructive use of their enforced idleness for example helping other community newspapers launching a press agency and producing other media  after a lull of some months during which time the government made strong verbal attacks on the alternative press it took action against the weekly mail suspending it for one month from november  in a move that was widely interpreted as a retreat in the face of international pressure from more severe action the weekly mail is generally recognized as the most prominent of the alternative press originally founded in response to the collapse of the rand daily mail in   it presents a high standard of reporting on political economic and human rights issues in south africa and an important proportion of analytical material as well as a significant arts section it is a vital channel for informed anti apartheid opinion and has during its three year history become an important academic resource it draws upon the work of a number of organizations specializing in distinct sociopolitical fields such as the human rights commission lawyers for human rights and the south african council of churches and makes this information accessible on a weekly basis although the weekly mail is vulnerable to the standard deficiencies of newspapers as an academic source it provides what is frequently the only material of  minister of home affairs stoffel botha described the alternative press on may   as media terrorists who gave publicity to revolutionaries see   the state president of south africa heralded the closure as a step toward consensual politics  p 
 the library quarterly any depth on crucial aspects of the south african condition since it is indexed it is an interim resource filling the gap between the annual publication of survey of race relations  recognized as a primary source on south african affairs a breakdown of the material found objectionable by the minister gives an indication of the explicit threat to research endeavor contained in the paper suspension he was particularly concerned about its coverage of security force action the activities and aims of banned and restricted organizations and the views of conscientious objectors all topics deserving comprehensive coverage in the nation libraries and vital to a reasoned debate about the future of south africa a closer look at the articles found offensive further illustrates this publication of constitutional guidelines put forward by the african national congress accompanied by sober analysis and some hostile comment an academic analysis by a respected political scientist at the university of the witwatersrand on the current state of the pan africanist congress and a general article on the secretary general of the south african council of churches frank chikane the minister is obliged to list the items which offend but not to give reasons  p  further measures gazetted against the press include the proscription of titles regarded as continuations of suspended publications and the compulsory deposit of copies of periodicals free of charge for scrutiny these restrictions also frustrate the publication process information gathering a particular characteristic of the state of emergency has been its inhibiting effect on information gathering at source this is not a new development as restrictions on access to black areas of south africa have long been in force but the emergency regulations are specifically framed in order to prevent the gathering of certain types of information for instance reporters and photographers are obliged to remove themselves from the scene of security force action and the taking of photographs is forbidden trained observers are frequently excluded by declaring an area such as the scene of a strike an operational zone even where there is no active unrest in this fashion the methods and conduct of the security forces remain unobserved by those with the skills and inclination to add such data to the documented record of contemporary south africa at the time of the declaration of the fifth emergency on june   the government announced its intention to register news agency businesses and those employed by them  the south african government has long wanted to control journalists and a register was suggested
in a state of emergency  by the  steyn commission but this has been averted by selfregulation agreements with the mainline newspaper press union npu in the s however parallel to the growth of the alternative press has been the development of alternative news agencies which have gathered information and released it to the press in a way incompatible with the state of emergency the proposed register was aimed at such activity but its implications were imperfectly thought out opposition was intense and the regulation was withdrawn on july   however the threat of registration which has hung over south african journalists for some years remains suppression of viewpoints at an individual level the greatest impact of the emergency has been felt by the detention without trial provisions the exact number of persons detained since july  is not known because of the disruption experienced by human rights organizations active in this field the enormity of the task and the lack of monitoring structures in small towns and rural areas detention was common before  most notably under the terrorism and internal security acts but the numbers of persons detained annually were in the hundreds since mid  at least  people have been detained  among them have been many journalists for example almost the entire staff of saamstaan an oudtshoorn community newspaper have been detained at some stage some  have been in prison without trial since june  and an equal number have experienced detention for over one year the purpose of the state is quite clear this is preventive detention designed to silence articulate leaders and organizers of anti apartheid organizations their views and their ability to disseminate them through any media are securely locked up in prison in the same way as those of fellow activists convicted in the many political trials that have taken place in south africa since the mid s  those who have been released enter what has become known in now rather cliched terms as the larger prison of south africa important  one of the longest serving detainees louis mnguni is a lecturer in philosophy from the university of the north at turfloop and northern transvaal president of the united democratic front held since june   he was hospitalized twice during his detention which ended in mid february   the latest is the delmas treason trial involving a  day trial twenty two defendants and  individual and fifty organizational co conspirators the conviction of four of the defendants on treason charges effectively made illegal mass peaceful mobilization against apartheid
 the library quarterly leaders have been restricted under the emergency in a fashion less obvious than those banned in the pre emergency era under the internal security act gone are the days when careers were callously wrecked and all social life was denied nevertheless the restrictions suffered today contain functional and geographical limitations although they vary from person to person they tend to restrict ex detainees to a given magisterial district and sometimes to evening and night time house arrest and frequently contain prohibitions on publishing and public speaking as well as access to institutions involved in the dissemination of information such restrictions are now commonplace on the release of long term high profile detainees  they may also since september   simply be gazetted on anyone without being personally served similarly the government has acted against anti apartheid organizations under pre emergency security legislation organizations were banned and their assets confiscated the african national congress anc pan africanist congress pac and the christian institute are famous examples under the state of emergency such effective corporate death is not imposed as organizations are able to exist in name carry out administrative tasks and meet financial obligations beyond this all activity is proscribed including publication of their or anyone else data and ideas on february   seventeen anti apartheid organizations were restricted entirely and the congress of south african trade unions was prohibited from engaging in any activity outside a narrow definition of trade union work the seventeen organizations were involved in grassroots anti apartheid activism education and human rights monitoring a few days later the committee for the defense of democracy an umbrella body formed in cape town to carry on some of these tasks was itself restricted in august  the end conscription campaign an organization opposed to military conscription the occupation of namibia and the presence of the south african defence force in black townships was restricted and from october to december twelve more political and community organizations including one founded in the aftermath of the february restrictions were effectively banned the amount of literature thus censored was enormous most important the state of emergency has cut off the flow of information and opinion concerning conscientious objection human rights violations detentions political trials assassinations and disappearances alternative educa for example zwelakhe sisulu editor of new nation was held for  days and released on december   when he was effectively disbarred from political or journalistic activity his restriction order runs to three pages and shows that he was held for his work as ajournalist  he had been detained twice before in  and  and banned between  and 
in a state of emergency  tion and grassroots organization and methods of resistance in the black townships the government has used relatively low key and sophisticated techniques with a primary but not sole aim of reinforcing censorship of anti apartheid viewpoints and data which would cast its actions in a poor light in the words of desmond tutu archbishop of cape town the government idea is to smash effective political opposition no matter how peaceful and to rule with the jackboot many people see it here as a declaration of war against peaceful and legally operating groups  the government strategy has not been entirely successful some churches have taken up part of the work of restricted organizations and documentation tasks have been shouldered by unaffected bodies some restricted groups especially in the area of human rights monitoring have re emerged under new names and the human rights commission was established in johannesburg by the end of  there were signs that the disrupted documentation process was beginning to revive militarization the overall characteristic of the current state of emergency is the extent to which it contributes to the growing militarization of south african society under the emergency a limitation of liability in terms of civil and criminal proceedings covers the actions of all security force personnel as long as they act in good faith and have reason to believe that they are behaving in the interests of state security in other words security force power including censorship is virtually limitless unless mala fide can be proved in court the state of emergency is the legal device by which the country is increasingly administered by the national security management system nsms this has been developed since the late s and while details are still obscure it is known that it shadows every level of civil administration from parliament to local government each basic unit known as a joint management centre jmc  has four main interests information gathering security welfare and communications the latter function known by the afrikaans acronym komkom kommunikasie kommittee has relevance to the information dissemination structure of south africa and thereby to libraries  while a pall of silence has been drawn across so many aspects of south african life komkom generates publicity for government initiatives through  his opinion is amplified in   it is widely believed that komkom has a penchant for literary endeavor in the form of smear pamphlets
 the library quarterly printed and other media forms with the aid of local organizations which have the approval of the authorities nsms strategy is based on the counter insurgency theory of beaufr  pp  ff which argues that the total onslaught against south africa manifests itself in a lowintensity civil war in which words and thoughts are weapons  p  there is increasing evidence that those involved in documenting human rights abuses are potential assassination victims no aspect of social economic or political life is immune from militarization and the impact upon libraries is likely to be felt in the form of growing lacunae in collections covering south african affairs censorship information and libraries in many senses the state of emergency represents a microcosm of south african censorship like apartheid itself and its educational system it is used to divide people from one another and accentuate their differences rather than their common humanity and problems this is achieved by cutting channels of communication between different communities in such a way that ignorance is encouraged like non emergency security legislation it contains the power to silence articulate individuals and influential organizations in a variety of ways denying them the access to the media that is vital to discourse in such a vast country with its variegated society like the legislation which controls the flow of data on specific aspects of the political economy it hampers knowledge about state policy and methodology which would lead to a fuller understanding of the nature of south african society and therefore ideas about how it might be changed finally like the statutes which control access to books and periodicals it allows the state to ban outright as a last resort publications which break through the censorship net notwithstanding the need to see censorship as a continuum there is  beliswa mhlawuli of grassroots who appeared in the bbc documentary suffer the children lost an eye in an attack on her in guguletu cape town in early  godfrey dhlomo a young detainees parents support committee worker who appeared in a similar american documentary was killed in february  near johannesburg on may   dr david webster senior lecturer in social anthropology at the university of the witwatersrand and a well known human rights activist was shot dead by gunmen outside his home he had just completed a report for the united nations on political assassinations in south africa  one of the most disturbing aspects of the declaration of the state of emergency on june   was the sense of isolation and lack of news about local and national events experienced by those closely involved a major task of anti apartheid groups since then has been to keep open channels of communication and to develop alternative media
in a state of emergency  virtue in detaching a component such as the state of emergency and subjecting it to close scrutiny in particular comparing it to other facets of the system although fewer papers are being written on the topic than ten years ago there is quantitative and qualitative evidence   to show that traditional censorship epitomized by the book banning provisions of the publications and internal security acts remains a problem for research and library collection building in south africa it is also however an obstacle which the adventurous have sometimes been able to avoid this has been feasible because of a number of internal contradictions in the bureaucratic methods required to sustain it the need to use librarians who are not always cooperative to police the system the difficulty of tracing all the published work of banned and listed persons and the impossibility in a relatively open society with strong links with other countries of controlling the world literature by comparison with the censorship described above as traditional the censorship provisions of the state of emergency may be characterized as radical fully justifying the government description of its tactics as a total response the emergency censorship provisions require no surrogates such as librarians and are directly administered by state agents representing a significant change in tactics lists of titles banned under the publications and internal security acts suggest that the main area of library stock affected is overseas theoretical material used to place local research in context emergency censorship on the other hand clearly has little effect on this type of publication in the course of less than three years however it has already had a devastating effect on the collection and publication of the raw material of the sociopolitical and economic condition of south africa a trend which will leave a lasting imprint on the country libraries the irony of this situation lies in the fact that the emergency has in some academic quarters stimulated the urge to research and document so dramatic are the events unfolding around people nevertheless intellectual activity was placed under an effective state of emergency well before  and some aspects have for years been potentially criminalized the library stock affected has belonged almost exclusively to the arts and social sciences although a few scientists are to be found in the ranks of the listed the nature of the state of emergency will accentuate this stifling research in a wide range of fields most research in the humanities and social sciences requires as reference  for example the famous south african botanist eddie roux all of whose works on education south african politics and history as well as pasture science rural economy and plant physiology are technically still banned because roux was a member of the south african communist party he died in 
 the library quarterly point or contextual framework a background of documentation and there are many instances in south africa where research has been thwarted by an absence of library material for example south africa has one of the world worst records concerning capital punishment in  a campaign for its abolition was resuscitated but attempts by researchers to locate a body of literature on the topic have led to disappointment the state of emergency can only exacerbate this type of situation clearly the existing south african political economy desperately needs censorship to achieve optimum levels of conformity and intellectual repression and acceptance of official values by censoring it reveals itself as extremely insecure although the social structure and international relations of south africa are very different from those in eastern europe it is possible to apply milan kundera definition of censorship organized forgetting  p  in other words censorship is a stateorchestrated attempt to erase from popular consciousness and the historical record areas of fact and ideas two prominent anti apartheid academics have responded to this in concrete terms by arguing that our struggle is also a struggle of memory against forgetting  p  one of those convicted in november  in the delmas treason trial patrick lekota national publicity secretary of the united democratic front has written the apartheid regime has tried to wipe out all memory of the mass struggles of the s leading political organizations of the time have been outlawed leaders and ordinary people have been jailed or forced into exile others were killed some have been banned or listed their words their memories becoming unquotable books pamphlets posters badges flags were seized in numerous raids or were censored in silence years of campaigning mass struggles involving millions of people all of these the system has tried to cast into permanent oblivion  p  in a society in which the information system is so distorted and manipulated the position of libraries is obviously problematic if libraries are laboratories for peaceful intellectual endeavor and creativity then censorship is an act of violence against cerebral activity in a country as diverse as south africa in which political debate reaches depths as fundamental as its geographical extent and the degree to which basic civil rights shall be offered and to whom libraries have immense educational potential not only might they act as a nexus for different strands of social and political thought from within the country but they are also major means of access to such thought from the rest of the world instead they have to a significant and alarming extent been harnessed to the political imperatives of the state they have been successfully cut off for example from all but a fraction of the aspira
in a state of emergency  tions and problems of the proletariat that fragment which has been documented by academics and political activists in this way through no fault of their own they are a monument to our ignorance rather than our understanding of south african society owing to restrictions on individuals corporate bodies and dissemination of official information vast lacunae are developing in the documented record and it is possible that these gaps will never be filled even under a more democratic dispensation some material is available in foreign collections specializing in southern african affairs and there are first signs of the expatriation of south african documentation centers however even overseas collections can do nothing to counter the various ways in which the government suppresses publication the role of the library is being progressively circumscribed and it is pertinent to conclude by considering what librarians might do to counter the trend there is little evidence from the past to suggest that librarians as a professional group have done much to counter the fundamentals of traditional censorship i i within the last decade however the foundations of a new paradigm have been laid within south african librarianship it contains a number of weaknesses but draws its undoubted strength from the desire to place librarianship within a democratic and post apartheid context its adherents are to be found in all types of library although generally not yet in positions of great influence the most active of them work in resource centers run by groups of political community trade union church and human rights organizations  these are now located in the major cities of south africa where they collect actively the material of anti apartheid groups and promote its use by a wide spectrum of society but particularly by those suffering from an inferior education or in extremis young people absent from school because they are on the run from the police or vigilante groups allied to the state the existence of these libraries is precarious they are often run by groups which are at risk of banning or restriction although some church denominations are increasingly assuming a protective role they are frequently raided by the police who have as has been seen wide powers of seizure finally they are prime targets for the latest form of south african censorship arson as a result of firebombing and explosions  those who run libraries resource centers and documentation and archive collections housing antigovernment material are thus moving toward the epicenter of a civil war it is not easy to see how such  in november  the south african council of churches sacc exiled its ecumenical documentation and information centre for eastern and southern africa edicesa to harare zimbabwe because one of edicesa objectives is the documentation of the south african regional policy of destabilization
 the library quarterly resources can be protected when faced with the power at the disposal of the state or groups close to it so far university libraries have been virtually immune from state action although reluctance to control universities too blatantly cannot be assumed in perpetuity conditions in south africa change very rapidly and the state of emergency has provided the backdrop for some surreal experiences at least two librarians have been detained since mid  and others have been questioned the case of annica van gylswyk an archivist in charge of the documentation centre for african studies at the university of south africa in pretoria is the most famous in her employment and through her activities for the black sash in the winterveld region she was closely involved with the material and the personalities of the anti apartheid movement and much of her interrogation by security police focused on her travels as a collector of archival material her jailers put her under severe psychological pressure for some weeks and her employers placed her on unpaid leave threatened with further imprisonment without trial she elected to be deported to sweden land of her birth and passport although she had lived in south africa for thirty years and was married to a citizen  her experience provides a model for the danger perceived by the state from the documentation of the struggle  p  for the time being it would appear that there is some space for university libraries to pursue a creative acquisitions policy and fulfill an imaginative role in the documentation of current affairs this is particularly pertinent in an era when the idea of the people university is being canvassed one interpretation centers on the extension to the oppressed of those ideals for which universities have traditionally stood freedom of expression thought and information for instance but which have too often been the preserve of a privileged elite universities could contribute to the democratic process by assisting in the documentation display and circulation of material under threat from the state the censorship ramifications of the state of emergency should act as a very clear signal to concerned south african librarians traditional censorship is dependent upon their cooperation coerced or voluntary and it is within their power to break down one part of the system while the authorities are otherwise involved in reinforcing it elsewhere south africa has never lacked courageous opponents of authoritarianism and racism some of the most admirable are today involved in the communications industry and there are signs that such people are becoming involved in the profession of librarianship the current strategy of the south african democratic movement is to work for broadbased and innovative opposition to the apartheid state at a time when it
