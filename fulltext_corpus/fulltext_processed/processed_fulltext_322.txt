the exchange of ideas in the advancement of knowledge howard w winger i t he problem of iron curtains and scholarship the exchange of knowledge in a divided world is essentially a problem of cross cultural communication the political division which has separated two thirds of the population and area of the world today into two nearly equal camps is but an important manifestation of conflicting cultures to point out the obvious differences which provoke the conflict would be painfully commonplace to attempt a deeper analysis would be too great a task for an introductory paper and would encroach upon the topics of other speakers they will deal with the barriers to knowledge discuss the life of the intellectual in the communist countries his books his libraries and his contributions survey the present means for cross cultural exchange of ideas and project the possible development of more effective devices in the future to introduce the subject i shall discuss the role of the exchange of ideas in the advancement of knowledge with special application to the problem of comunication between conflicting cultures confidence in the continous advancement of knowledge is an article of the modern creed although that faith is reflected in nearly every area of learning it is probably most characteristic of the attitudes people have toward the achievements of modern science people believe in the power of science to solve almost any problem nature can contrive the optimism does not stop short of a belief in the possibility of controlling the weather should crops fail for lack of rain it is expected that in the near future the agronomist will develop a grain as drouth resistant as a cactus or that science will at last succeed in pumping fresh water from the salt sea to wet the thirsty land such is the faith in advancing knowledge natural as it seems today such pride in the power of human reason has not been typical of past ages the ancients thought that too great a curiosity about nature and too much probing into its secrets would be sure to result in personal and communl calamity familiar stories reveal the attitude when adam and eve were driven from the garden of eden it was because they stole apples from the tree of knowledge according to a greek story in the golden age of innocence when there were no troubles to plague mankind pandora let her curiosity rule raised the lid of a forbidden box and released the ills the flesh has since been heir to phaeton with his chariot and daedalus with his waxcemented wings paid the price of flying too high prometheus more successful in his studies and experiments than either phaeton or daedalus stole the secret of fire and gave it to mankind as a result of his deed however the jealous gods chained him to a mountain peak and sent ravens to eat his liver the beliefs reflected in such stories survived into the middle ages faith in the accelerated conquest of nature for the good of mankind had little place in the ancient and medieval world sometimes today the nightmare of promethean experience disturbs our 
 the library quarterly confidence the achievements of science have indeed been miraculous it may be assumed that the actual accomplishments have outstripped the imagination of the seventeenth century innovators who started us on the way it is doubtful whether sir francis bacon who caught his death of cold trying to preserve a chicken in the snow ever envisioned modern deep freezes frozen orange juice or air conditioned automobiles the magnificent material devices of science however are impersonal sometimes they are used to produce suffering and destruction rather than to benefit mankind the tremendous technological strides made in the cataclysmic wars of our century have demonstrated that scientific advancement can be destructive in its very inception so great in fact are the powers of destruction stored in the arsenals of the world today that it would be small wonder if we harked back to the ancient distrust of proud and presumptuous knowledge human loss through the accretion of knowledge is in modern terms a paradox some of the most venerated and some of the most popular modern institutions ranging from the university down to the television quiz program derive their social value from the good that the advancement of knowledge is supposed to bring about consequently the modern answer to the paradox differs from the ancient one there is no general disposition to stifle scientific advancement or to renounce scientific gains because some discoveries have miscarried we do not blame such difficulties on the speed of the advancement of knowledge in the natural sciences instead we criticize the social sciences and the humanities because they have not kept pace in other words our problem is not that we have too much knowledge but that we have too little for all knowledge is interrelated a technological advance has an effect on the organization of the society which produced it and a corresponding effect on the personal motivations of the members of that society one need look no farther than the perennial pride and headache of the american society the automobile to find evidence of the interrelationship originally a technological achievement the automobile has disrupted some communities created others become a symbol of personal pride and power and exercised a substantial force on the american economy obviously advancement in the field of the natural sciences brings with it a need for adaptations in our knowledge about men and how they behave both in groups and in their personal situations the advancement of knowledge means different kinds of solutions in all areas of knowledge and involves the exchange of ideas in the social sciences and humanities as well as in the natural sciences ii the role of the exchange of ideas in the advancement of knowledge is summarized in the scholarly postulate that the advancement of knowledge depends on the free access to ideas the theoretical basis for the postulate rests partly on the constant need for checking conclusions against conflicting opinions and partly on the role of outside sources of information in inspiring intellectual innovations john stuart mill in his protest against the silencing of dissenting opinions gave the classical expression of the need to test conclusions the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is that it is robbing the human race posterity as well as the existing generation those who dissent from the opinion still

 the library quarterly all the materials and all the skills and processes needed in the creation and exploitation of the invention had long been known and understood socially and intellectually fifteenth century society was ripe for it a secular book trade had arisen literacy was increasing books were in demand the inevitability of the invention is so apparent after the fact that john gutenberg although for a century after the invention of printing he was the only serious claimant for the honor of inventor has trouble retaining his laurels there is so much evidence that other men living in his time and place might also have done it despite any claim to inevitability however the invention of printing was not inevitable as from a law of nature it was instead made possible by men relatively easy access to the ideas necessary for the invention brought to their simultaneous attention were the paper and the wood blocks of china the oils of the painter the metals used in various crafts the techniques and skills of casting dye cutting and carpentry an understanding of mechanics and perhaps most important of all a knowledge of books and their uses many epochs in intellectual history more brilliant in important respects than the fifteenth century in western europe had passed before such a constellation of ideas resulted in the invention of printing in contrast to gutenberg as a case where ideas crowded in on a man erasmus serves as an example of a man who went to the ideas a turning point in his intellectual development which directed him toward becoming an outstanding humanist of the sixteenth century was a journey he made from paris to oxford in  at the time he was an impecunious student fresh from the scotist college in paris where he had been trained in the straitest of scholastic sects the antithesis of humanism at oxford he met john colet richard charnock and sir thomas more all humanists of greater or lesser light later he wrote about the strong impression colet made with his sincere and impassioned attacks against the scholastic method of reasoning and study sir thomas more inspired erasmus to write the praise of folly a book which is dedicated to mfore and of which the original latin title ecornium mnoriae is a pun on the great english humanist name thus foreign travel was an obvious means through which erasmus found access to the variety of ideas needed by the intellectual leader his whole career and the careers of many other scholars of his time was shaped by the ease of establishing personal contacts with scholars of other nations library books in many cases of course have inspired the intellectual and provided him with information to develop his thought carl van doren for instance has recorded how he wandered aimlessly about the campus at the beginning of his college career spending most of his free time in the gymnasium then he wrote in his reminiscences random in the library i discovered marlowe and the glory of the great verse changed my world as if mountains had sprung up out of the prairie having myself lived one year though much later next door to the van doren home in urbana i can testify that the prairies there are very flat so van doren reaction to marlowe seems tremendous in connection with our present topic of the exchange of knowl f seebohm the oxford reformers d ed london longmans green  co  pp  f three worlds new york harper  bros  p

 the library quarterly cross cultural communication raises different problems people of different cultural backgrounds may differ so much in their concepts of reality and in their visions of how reality should be transformed that their very bases of thought are different if the bases of thought are different then the symbols on which all communication depends may not have the same referents and communication becomes very difficult the questions arise what are the possibilities for the fruitful exchange of ideas in the face of different ideologies and different visions of utopia what means must be taken to surmount the barriers which differences erect i must leave the elaboration of these questions to other speakers but i should like to discuss some of the general implications the question which concerns me most is the possibility of intellectual co operation between people with greatly differing cultural backgrounds the value of free access to different meanings arising from different bases of thought would differ only in degree from the value asserted by john stuart mill as arising from the collision of truth with error the possibility always exists of refining knowledge by exposing it to different points of view and also of replacing an idea with a better one both east and west have shown vigor initiative and intellectual originality both may gain through exchanging ideas in advancing their own and in correcting them where necessary one might hope however to gain even more from the exchange of ideas he might hope to find ideas which are directly applicable even though they are the product of another culture innovations which can stand one on another regardless of their source such reciprocal use of ideas is what i mean by intellectual co operation intellectual co operation of the kind described is of course very difficult if there is such a conflict in ideologies as to make communication almost impossible an example of such a conflict may be found in considering a paradox posed by the ancient philosopher zeno he held that time and space are illusions and in support of his theory proposed a race between a man and tortoise in which the tortoise was given a head start he reasoned that even though achilles was a faster runner than his slower rival he could never overtake the tortoise because while achilles was making up the original difference the tortoise moved ahead some while achilles was making up the new difference the tortoise advanced still more and so on ad infinitum this proposition is so ridiculous that it cannot withstand the assault of any child who wants to race a tortoise however it takes a philosopher and a mathematician to refute zeno logic by showing that he was mixing concepts of finite with transfinite numbers most people do not trouble about his logic his abstract notions of space and time so contradict their pragmatic realizations that they regard zeno paradox as a silly fable unrelated to any serious thought fortunately differences in ideology are usually not so comprehensive as those revealed in the narrowly restricted paradoxes of zeno cultural contacts prevail along such a broad front that there are sure to be openings in any curtain marking the division between peoples with different ways of life ideologies touch every aspect of public cognition and people can always find some points of agreement which provide opportunities for cross cultural communication one way to promote the exchange of knowledge in a divided world is to look for areas of agreement that may serve as chinks in the iron
exchange of ideas in advancement of knowledge  curtain any branch of knowledge which uses uniform methods and applies them to a uniform field of observation provides a broad basis of agreement science has long claimed to be such a unified system of thought and some examples illustrate the characteristic visscher recounted an example from the study of muscle chemistry a chain of brilliant discoveries was started when englehardt a russian physiologist identified an enzymatic function of myocin subsequently new links in the chain were forged by szentgyorgi a hungarian cori an american and others in belgium sweden britain and elsewhere such linear contributions to the advancement of knowledge drawing from investigators in so many different countries imply a unified system of thought which supports the claims of science to be one world of learning in science characteristic national interests may be important but such specialized developments do not disrupt the field the integrity of the sciences provides some of the best opportunities for piercing holes in our iron curtains bases of agreement are also characteristic of the humanities that branch of knowledge treats the responses of the individual to the great constants of life although techniques differ and each artist derives merit from his unique treatment of universals great art transcends cultural differences evidence of the universality of great literature is shown in the world wide appreciation of shakespeare cervantes goethe hugo tolstoi and many others from the same and other lands on a somewhat less olympian plane the award of the nobel prize for literature to authors from eighteen different countries displays some of the characteristic of universality even a novel which critics say is not a great work may serve as a good device of cross cultural communication such a one might be the russian novel by vladimir dudintsev not by bread alone it has been popular in america and i had to put my name on the waiting list at my local public library to borrow a copy the story has interest and suspense it deals with high motives and it emphasizes courage resolution and loyalty to friends and ideas the characters in the novel reveal many points of common information with american readers they have read kipling an author popular in america and they refer to lopatkin the hero who is an inventor as a budding edison in these common points of reference literature finds chinks in the iron curtains cross cultural communication may pose a more difficult problem in the social sciences than in other branches of learning because so many cultural differences concern matters of social organization the institutional bias of a society resulting from its peculiar organization is bound to affect the way people write and think about the very institutions which create the bias in looking for holes in our iron curtains we may have to consider the fact that discussion may revolve around either general principles or the particulars of a problem as a colleague at the university of chicago long a student of these affairs remarked to me an american economist is not likely to reach agreement talking about economic principles with a scholar from the communist countries the opportunities for a fruitful exchange of ideas are more favorable however in respect to some particulars of the economic enterprise such as exchanges between russian and iowa farmers a review of soviet educational ret op cit p 
 the library quarterly search illustrates the particular values which american scholars may gain from a study of soviet work despite their disagreement with russian educators on the principles of education the author of the review pointed out how russian research on the use of visual aids in the teaching of mathematics is directly applicable to some american work in fact he expressed a high opinion of the importance of the whole soviet research effort although he pointed out that it was the result in part of a commonly accepted premise that many of us believe untenable this acknowledged value of particular work done on an untenable premise is a striking confirmation of the importance of looking for particulars of agreement in an area of general disagreement it suggests possibilities for the fruitful exchange of ideas in areas that might seem wholly restricted v the history of scholarship is a record of the importance of cross cultural contacts considering the importance of such communication in the invention of the alphabet one might call it the abc of intellectual innovation for the alphabet was the product of a meeting between cultures it was the invention of some people probably the phoenicians who lived between the dominant nile and tigris euphrates cultural centers the egyptians and the sumerians vie with one another for the honor of inventing writing and during the second millennium bc the babylonians who had succeeded the sumerians in the tigris euphrates center and the egyptians on the nile were using systems of writing which even then were quite ancient both the babylonian cuneiform characters and the egyptian hieroglyphs employed phonetic symbols which were the key to the alphabet but neither the babylonians nor the egyptians saw the advantage of using a small number of characters consistently to express the phonetic values the alphabet was the invention of the people living between through war captivity and trade they had become acquainted with the writing systems of their powerful neighbors applying what they learned in their own different cultural milieu they hit on the idea of using a limited number of characters thus the moabite stone of around  bc recorded an alphabet of twenty two characters the best that came from the tigris euphrates area was the assyrian syllabary of around six hundred characters the egyptians continued to use several thousand characters for writing down to the time of cleopatra and the rosetta stone it was cross cultural contacts which produced the alphabet the clash of disparate cultures was again reflected in the earliest important library development to which modern western culture can look back with any feeling of kinship the great libraries and schools at alexandria resulted from the conscious attempts of the ptolemaic kings and their wise men to create a cultural unity which combined greek thought with egyptian and other eastern tradition their activities embraced all the world of knowledge they were avid and even piratical book collectors they sponsored the translation of semitic writings into greek the most famous example being the septuagint version of the old testament scriptures they were responsible for editing and establishing a canon of the greek classical writers science flourished and philosophers from all over greece and o george w boguslavsky psychological research in soviet education science ccxxv may

 the library quarterly not the least important the european knights had a chance to observe the fruits of arabic learning at firsthand communication is always an incidental effect of warfare and soldiers are disseminators of knowledge it takes a considerable amount of advancement of knowledge however to make up for the destruction armies wreak and it is to be hoped that some means of acquiring and spreading learning can be found that do not have all the baneful side effects of war less destructive was a second new channel introduced by commerce even before the first crusade was preached in  the italian port cities began their rise based on trade with the east finally as artz pointed out the arabic books introduced new ideas into western scholarship the trade in arabic books developed as a result of purposeful effort it was pushed by an able group of men eager for arabic knowledge willing to journey to a strange and not altogether friendly land and to learn a new tongue in its pursuit the names of the translators who went to spain in the twelfth century are indicative of the extensiveness of the interest and study they included peter of cremona alfred the englishman michael scot and hermann the german hailing obviously from widely separated points in europe the spread of arabic ideas in europe and the promotion of their effect on scholarship were much more than an incidental effect of the crusades and the renewed trade with the moslem lands scholars demonstrated that intellectuals who are convinced of the value of cross cultural communication can do something themselves to bring it about they can learn the languages and master the ideas providing they are given the materials and the opportunities vi in summarizing these reflections on the role of cross cultural communication in the advancement of knowledge i think perhaps the strongest point i have made in justification of our present conference is that librarians and scholars may by their own efforts promote the exchange of ideas this conference is an effort to provide better understanding of the issues met in such attempts relevant to that conclusion are the following points  the concept of the advancement of knowledge through the exchange of ideas extends to all branches of knowledge the social sciences and the humanities as well as the natural sciences  the new points of view gained in cross cultural exchanges provide a testing ground for conclusions already held furnish inspiration for intellectual innovations and provide ideas for the development of scholarship  areas of agreement exist which surmount ideological differences and they can be used to punch holes in our iron curtains  finally where agreements cannot be reached on principles the possibility still exists for the fruitful exchange of ideas on the particulars of a scholarship
