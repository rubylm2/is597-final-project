racial battle fatigue the unspoken burden of black women faculty in lis  it is even more crucial to give voice to the experiences of women faculty of color in their everyday work life although previous research addressed the experiences of faculty of color with regard to campus climate little if any research has addressed the experiences of african american faculty in lis with regard to racial battle fatigue rbf this paper will explore this phenomenon and aims to contribute to a growing body of literature in this area unleashing the burden african american women faculty like myself may find it uncomfortable discussing our challenges in academia because thinking through where we fit within the systems of advantage and structural disadvantage in the academy is daunting i accepted the invitation to think about the ways in which social inequality is reproduced in our discipline despite our collective support for diversity and inclusion and in doing that i found it important to consider this issue as it relates to black women faculty in lis it is my intention to shed light on the stress that women of color face daily while performing the already demanding responsibilities of research teaching and service my revelation came early i realized in graduate school that my journey in academia would not be rosy despite being selected as part of a doctoral cohort of predominantly people of color there were several instances when i witnessed microaggressions for example i was aghast when a senior professor chastised a doctoral student of color by saying that she should be put on a leash my colleague and i interpreted that to mean that as a woman of color she could not be free to express her thoughts and ideas and when she did it was not in the way that this professor saw fit so my colleague was silenced this early experience quickly made me aware that even among highly educated people and those who purport to embrace diversity racism was still pervasive i continued to witness and experience both subtle and blatant acts throughout my graduate study ranging from being told that theres probably some school in the country that will hire you after graduation to questions about my choice to do a dissertation exploring racism in the lis profession the lesson was learned early on in graduate school and those who dont learn the lessons dont make it and they become the statistic that black people cant get a phd these microaggressions continued while i was an assistant professor perhaps the most egregious were the frequent references about my p hysique these commentaries ranged from asking questions about my shoe size to the clothes that i wear to my weight i often wondered if my intellectual ability took a backseat to my physical appearance since there was more conversation around that than the support i needed as junior faculty having learned the lesson earlier i was reluctant to challenge my colleagues because i did not want to become the statistic of a black woman in academia who didnt get tenure i have come to realize that these microaggressions have a real life impact of and the long term
 chancellor accumulation of these experiences can create a burden and strain that manifest in physical mental and emotional fatigue racial battle fatigue racial battle fatigue was conceptualized by education professor william a smith with an initial focus on african american male students and university faculty his article black faculty coping with racial battle fatigue the campus racial climate in a postcivil rights era  provides a detailed explanation of the context function and impact of rbf on the african american university faculty member he contends that rbf is likely to occur when a person of color reacts to the disturbing conditions in dealing with racism in their everyday work life symptoms of rbf can be physiological psychological or behavioral in nature including but not limited to tension headaches constant anxiety ulcers increased swearing and complaining insomnia rapid mood swings difficulty thinking or speaking and social withdrawal smith  smith yosso  solorzano  rbf is also the physical mental and emotional manifestation of racial microaggressions microaggressions are subtle unconscious layered and increasingly spoken and unspoken insults directed at people of color based on race and other distinguishing characteristics that cause unnecessary stress upon blacks while benefiting whites smith  smith et al  solorzano ceja  yosso  over time these racial microaggressions can cause various forms of mental emotional and physical stress for african americans and other people of color the continuous exposure to and accrual of racial microaggressions cause rbf the constant threat of racial microaggressions can cause rbf to remain activated and symptoms can occur in anticipation of a racist event rapid breathing upset stomach frequent diarrhea or urination smith  not only does the constant battle with racial stress disrupt the lives of people of color but the subsequent psychological and physiological symptoms of rbf can also be fatal when it goes unnoticed untreated misdiagnosed or dismissed smith et al  rbf is a useful model for analyzing the constant exposure to stress from encountering everyday racism on the university campus smith  see figure  additionally this theoretical framework aids in our understanding the perceived professional role expectations of faculty of color including black faculty and white women due to the increasing numbers of white women and students of color and the corresponding need for women and people of color in the faculty ranks corbin smith  garcia  black women faculty women of colorasian black latina and native americanconstitute a crucial yet small proportion of library and information science lis educators according to the association for library and information science education alise the pre eminent association for library and information science educators these ethnic groups comprise approximately
