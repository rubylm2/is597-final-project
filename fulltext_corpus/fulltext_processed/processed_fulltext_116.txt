 the library quarterly acy services in libraries for linguistic minority populations employs similar language this functional approach is associated with the acquisition of a set of technical skills equipping individuals for better jobs and adoption of the dominant culture and language implicit in such an approach is that economic prosperity and cultural and linguistic assimilation are a public and desired good and that equal access to economic opportunities and social circles indeed exists on the contrary the reality for linguistic and other minorities is rather sinister they have encountered a racism of exclusion tokenism or segregation and their cultural religious and social freedoms have been compromised for historical and contemporary treatises of race in the united states see for example   this conceptualization of literacy or the ideological model of literacy  is elitist as it defines literacy from the outside or dominant culture us defining them and categorizes people into haves and have nots  furthermore it recognizes neither an individual literacy in nondominant languages nor differences in literacy levels when engaged in different social circumstances for example a doctor is typically less literate at a mathematics conference than at a medical one one social circumstance is the interaction with a library librarian or information system a library or an information system presents literacy challenges in its own right  people such as immigrants who may not be familiar with what libraries are and how information is organized within them will have difficulties gaining access to them mike baynham  pp    illustrates this by using the following passage from the novel kes a kestrelfor a knave by barry hines  got any books on hawks missis the girl behind the counter looked up from sorting coloured tickets in a tray hawks  linguistic minorities are people whose languages are not the dominant or official ones in society based on the  us census data on languages other than english spoken at home more than half  percent or  million of the  million us residents who spoke a language other than english at home reported they spoke spanish  p  spanish was spoken nine times more frequently at home than french  million the secondmost frequently spoken non english language in the home this was followed by german  million speakers chinese  million speakers and italian  million speakers the  census reflected old and new immigration respectively with a decline in the number of speakers of european languages since the last census and an increase in the number of speakers of spanish and asian and pacific island languages speakers of asian or pacific island languages for example chinese japanese vietnamese hindi korean tagalog and other languages totaled  million

literacy practices of minorities  tegic directions for delivering appropriate literacy services to linguistic minorities definitions of literacy the literature on literacy reveals that its conceptualization is social in nature it shows that literacy has had various definitions during different historical periods and that the extent to which one is literate is different depending on the situation or social context anabel powell newman and caroline beverstock traced changes in the definitions of literacy which have included the ability to sign one own name the ability to read and write the number of years of formal schooling and attainment of fourth grade level functional literacy  while these definitions emphasized the acquisition of technical skills other literacy experts have drawn attention to literacy as situationally or socially defined if anything is clear from looking at the large body of literature on literacy it is that the very idea of literacy has changed and continues to change increasingly literacy is being seen as a social phenomenon as opposed to an isolated process of decodingencoding text literacy research is beginning to take into account social context and social change and to pay attention to the relationship between literacy and gender  p  basic or technical definitions of literacy are concerned with the acquisition of literacy skills that is reading writing and speaking a language and expanded definitions make reference to the benefits of literacy robert disch describes the benefits of literacy as twofold utilitarian and aesthetic and spiritual  utilitarian benefits include economic prosperity social advancement and intellectual growth anthropologists sylvia scribner and michael cole define literacy in a basic way as a set of socially organized practices which make use of a symbol system and a technology for producing and disseminating it  p  this definition used to research learning and uses of literacy in west african vai culture refers to language as a symbol system and is inclusive of both oral and written languages such a definition does not exclude oral literacy such as found in the hmong and some native american cultures the scribner and cole definition also describes literacy as a set of socially organized practices recognizing societal control and influence or group consensus in the setting of literacy behavior and standards an example of an expanded definition is found in the national literacy act of  of the united states it defines literacy as an individual ability to read write and speak in english and compute and solve
 the library quarterly problems at levels of proficiency necessary to function on the job and in society to achieve one goals and one knowledge and potential for a multicultural nation such as the united states this definition is exclusionist because it refers to literacy in only english the official language another aspect of literacy not included in the above expanded definition is the ability to analyze and critically evaluate information that is information literacy it is necessary because it is critical for individuals to recognize the context the quality and hidden agenda of the information being consumed furthermore as we encounter an increasingly informationand technology intensive world one requires the ability to read and write using multimedia preferably in english and to critically evaluate texts the emphasis on the english language is due to the anglo american bias of multimedia such as the internet   this new literacy  is considered to be essential to the success of our youth especially as we enter the next millennium similar competencies are expressed in the new information literacy standards for student learning developed by the american association of school librarians and the association for communications and technology  their nine standards are clustered in three areas information literacy independent learning and social responsibility a significant aspect of these standards is the view that information consumption and application are interdependent which is demonstrated by linking information literacy to self development and societal participation the definitions of literacy examined thus far are representative of the diverse views that exist regarding the concept of literacy and show that literacy can mean something different depending on time place and situation thus libraries have been influenced by the way literacy has been defined by policy makers over time definitions that have tended to emphasize functional skills in order for librarians to provide appropriate literacy services to linguistic minorities they need to expand their concept of literacy to take into account the language and cultural knowledge of linguistic minorities the notions of multiple literacies and emancipatory literacy to be discussed later are such concepts socially contextualized nature of literacy the new views of literacy put the insights and perspectives of literacy learners and users at the centre of research about literacy document the variety of communicative styles and cultural values that people
literacy practices of minorities  bring to literacy and look at literacy in its broader social context  p  it is these particular people centered and social views that illuminate for literacy workers the nature of literacy in linguistic minority communities to begin to explore the socially contextualized nature of literacy and how it adds to the complexity of defining literacy in linguistic minority communities i offer the following two contrasting examples my mother josefina was born in a village in guangdong china in  during a time when most girls did not have the privilege to learn to read and write however my mother persevered and learned the chinese language she married and in  moved to peru where my sisters and i were born our family lived within the company compound where my mother had little contact with the outside world except for family outings and weekly trips to the public market she learned the language of the market and to negotiate with vendors she relied on my father or relatives for other needed interactions with peruvian society and in their absence mishaps occurred such as a dentist removing the wrong tooth in  our family moved to vancouver canada here she found a large concentrated chinese community where she could obtain most services and mass media in chinese and encountered clearly marked prices that made shopping easy and well mapped out and labeled transportation routes that facilitated local travel my mother felt at ease and visited friends and conducted personal business independently although she knew less english than spanish she only learned a few english greetings and amazingly obtained her canadian citizenship by passing an oral examination in english after intensive study in canada my mother relied on her children to communicate with the english speaking world she did not use libraries even though she knew the value of libraries for her children and was aware that some had chinese language materials she stayed at home carrying out the duties of a homemaker and only in the last years of her life did she join any social groups a presbyterian church and a neighborhood tai chi group mrs wong fictitious name was in her late s when i met her and unlike my mother she was abuzz with activities more of a social butterfly than her own children she had immigrated to canada in her s and already knew english because she was raised in an upper middle class family in hong kong had received private schooling graduated from high school and was wellread in canada she attended advanced esl english as a second language classes to improve her english took arts and crafts classes at a community recreation center was an active library user and community volunteer swam regularly at a public pool and completed translation jobs on her home computer these stories begin to demonstrate not only the various types of literacies that can exist in linguistic minority or immigrant communities but also the differences in social life and networks educational background and pursuit of education and family responsibilities they reveal that the extent to which a person is literate in their heritage or other languages can depend on their culture social role education economic status and length of residence in their native or adoptive
 the library quarterly country for example the  national adult literacy study nals shows that those with higher educational attainment had higher levels of english literacy on all scales  these stories also demonstrate differences in the extent of coping acculturation and socialization in the dominant culture of their adoptive countries if we were to classify my mother using the national literacy act of  of the united states see above she would be considered illiterate despite being able to cope with a limited english or spanish vocabulary and a help network made up of family and friends being literate in chinese and having succeeded in her role as mother and homemaker my mother would be considered illiterate in both her adoptive countries except in the ethnic chinese communities this view of literacy is shortsighted in the context of delivering literacy services because it does not build on existing literacies and it views linguistic minorities as having nothing to offer to the learning process similarly baynham is concerned that if literacyilliteracy defines and categorizes people being sorted into the ave not box carries with it the stigma of being defined by a lack it creates what paulo freire calls  culture of silence there is no necessary outward sign that someone has difficulties with reading and writing it is well documented that adults with literacy difficulties develop networks and strategies to cope with their reading and writing demands  pp   such a culture of silence conceals the literacy needs that exist in linguistic minority communities according to brian street the new views of literacy no longer consider literacy as a havehave not dichotomy but rather as a continuum and incorporate a broad disciplinary base in understanding literacy the field of literacy studies has expanded considerably in recent years and new more anthropological and cross cultural frameworks have been developed to replace those of a previous era in which psychologistic and culturally narrow approaches predominated as they arguably still do in much educational and development literature where for instance educationalists and psychologists have focused on discrete elements of reading and writing skills anthropologists and sociolinguists concentrate on literacies the social practices and conceptions of reading and writing the rich cultural variation in these practices and conceptions leads us to rethink what we mean by them and to be wary of assuming a single literacy where we may simply be imposing assumptions derived from our own cultural practice onto other people literacies research into ernacular literacies within modern urban settings has begun to show the richness and diversity of literacy practices and meanings despite the pressures for uniformity exerted by the nation state and modern education systems  p  literacy practices of linguistic minorities baynham defines literacy practice as oncrete human activity involving not just the objective facts of what people do with literacy but

 the library quarterly for coping and transition across diverse discourse communities or sociolinguistic contexts include the use of formal and informal networks the use of heritage language when there are similarities for example english and spanish learning a limited set of literacy skills for routine activities such as answering the telephone and use of ethnic services and media  because work and household duties are priorities it may be impossible for an immigrant to fit literacy classes into a busy work schedule the need to take care of family responsibilities first especially for women may take precedence over improving one literacy linguistic minorities are extraordinary at coping without dominant language literacy especially if there is an ethnic community the conditions in which linguistic minorities find themselves may be selfor institutionally imposed and reflect both their readiness to embark on a path of literacy and the challenge for librarians and other literacy workers for immigrant women their literacy practices can position them in the home and constitute their identities in familial terms  measuring literacy in linguistic minority communities data on the literacy of linguistic minorities are often unavailable or inaccurate such flaws encountered in the data are often due to problems in data collection there are three common methods of measuring literacy self reported information surrogate indicators and direct measures  self reported data are considered unreliable because they are subjective and perceptual or based on reported levels of schooling which have the associated problems of surrogate indicators surrogate indicators such as grade level achievement may not be reliable indicators because literacy can also be acquired in the home community and workplace or if unused it does not reflect mastery of the respective grade level and different regional or national grade standards may not be comparable it is best to rely on actual assessments but they are typically biased toward national language achievement that is the encodingdecoding of the dominant language system the nals conducted in  found that white adults scored significantly higher than every other racial and ethnic group on the three literacy scales used prose literacy document literacy and quantitative literacy the limitation of the nals was that it was a survey of literacy in the english language not literacy in any universal sense of the word thus the results do not capture the literacy resources and abilities that some respondents possess in languages other than english  p  although international literacy data now exist on twelve
