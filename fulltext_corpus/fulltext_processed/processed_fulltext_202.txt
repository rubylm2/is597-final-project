a popular culture studies and library education gordon stevenson a course in popular culture was offered at the school of library and information science state university of new york at albany for the first time in the summer of  the course provided an unusual opportunity to explore certain dimensions of communications processes librarianship and the cultural environment of libraries that though not necessarily new to the curriculum needed a sharper focus after several experimental versions lib  popular culture and the library was added to the curriculum as a regular elective course in the school printed catalog it is described as follows lib  the nature and social functions of the contemporary popular culture as disseminated by the mass media the relationship between the popular culture and the library bibliographic sources selection and acquisition problems among other things the course asks students to seriously consider the proposition that the information transmitted by such popular culture figures as rod mckuen aretha franklin the beatles tarzan and jane archie bunker and georgette heyer is as important as the information that flows through channels serving scientists and scholars some of my colleagues have responded to this suggestion with interest and sympathy others with bemused silence or stunned incredulity the following account of some of the thinking that went into the course at albany will try to demonstrate that popular culture is a profoundly significant part of the total informational environment in which we all live and work and that a study of popular culture can provide a useful framework for a consideration of several important issues relating to the social functions of libraries the popular culture studies movement it is not likely that it would have occurred to anyone to offer a library school course in popular culture if there had not already been a widespread and vigorous attempt within higher education to establish popular culture studies as a clearly defined and legitimate area of academic research and teaching this movement which has been gathering momentum for the past ten years was not mentioned in the professional library literature until  a clarke published his article in  although a certain legitimacy has been achieved and scholars of considerable academic standing are contributing to the field popular culture is still not entirely respectable in all quarters of higher education nor is it yet a clearly defined discipline however it continues to have a tremendous vitality and its recent progress has been spectacular an examination of a back run of the journal of popular culture and programs this article first appeared in the journal of education for librarianship spring  vol  no  winter  
 ó journal of education for library and information science about the author at the time of publication gordon stevenson was associate professor school of library and information science state university of new york albany of the annual meetings of the popular culture association will show that the study of popular culture today is a vast sprawling movement going in many different directions and originating in other disciplines as diverse as literature american studies sociology journalism economics and architecture it has established at least a modest foothold at all levels of education from high school to postgraduate studies the need for educational innovation and change accounts at least in part for the interest generated by the study of popular culture it deals with lively and pertinent topics that in one way or another are intimately related to each student experience of the world in which he or she lives what is most intriguing about the current popular culture studies movement is the approach to the materials for the most part the approach is noncritical as opposed to the value laden approach characteristic of earlier academic encounters with current popular culture unencumbered by aesthetics of popular culture research centers on its historical structural functional and behavioral dimensions one of several concerns of popular culture studies is the use of messages artifacts and rituals in the communication of culture the messages relate to the structure of such institutions as family life and religion to political ideologies and myths and to personal value systems the artifacts are as diverse as comic books coke bottles and sound recordings the rituals are as mundane as watching television or going to a movie or a shopping center the course at albany there are many ways of studying popular culture and many reasons for studying it obviously not all of these are relevant to education for librarianship the following description drawn from one of several handouts distributed to students prior to registration outlines the general approach to these issues at albany popular culture the purpose of this course is to examine the social functions and meaning of popular culture ie the meaning of the message in such diverse popular forms of communication as gothic novels comic books tv advertisements and the other junk that clutters up our lives we will look for broad fundamental principles in a few selected examples first we will make a quick survey of the material by media print gothics sf westerns and crime sound recordings cw blues rock pop magazines such as my true story and the like etc then we will pick a few basic themes that cut across all or most media themes such as women in popular culture religion and the alienated hero we will be interested in the images life styles role models values and ideologies that are presented in popular culture we will touch only briefly on aesthetic and technical aspects of the pop arts students will be expected to read watch and listen to examples of popular culture think about it and analyze it and take part vigorously in class discussions in so far as possible we will study the bibliographical control of the material in each area with suggestions for collection building etc however the central point is whether volume l number 
popular culture studies and library education   or not libraries should assemble organize and disseminate popular culture materials the course will not aim at a consensus in answering this question but each student is expected to defend his own conclusions this is a reasonably accurate description of the external framework of the course and its purpose as conceived by the instructor and students there are however a hidden agenda and other unstated aims that are somewhat more subtle than is evident from this description assumptions the basic assumption of the course is that popular culture is a series of communications systems that play an important role in the organization and structure of the political cultural and economic institutions that control society an analysis based on traditional academic critical techniques labels most popular culture as trash and dismisses it as irrelevant trash it may very well be but irrelevant it is not bonanza and the fbi are morality plays the super bowl is a ritual celebrating the fundamental beliefs and ideals of democracy and popular song lyrics provide the young with images and role models from which they construct their fictional selves another assumption of the course questions widely held beliefs about the social significance of the production distribution and consumption of knowledge in the united states here we are dealing with sacrosanct assumptions that have influenced library education for more than a decade the course explores the hypothesis that contrary to what we have been led to believe modern industrialized urban societies at least as they are presently constituted require not more and more information of most of their individual members but less and less information this hypothesis draws in part on ideas such as those articulated by c w mills in his analysis of mass society and by h i schiller in his study of the relationship between private enterprise and the mass media the implications of this hypothesis go far beyond the immediate issue of the functions of popular culture it raises such questions as these how much information does a person need to function in modern society how are needs created what types of information are needed what conflicts emerge from a lack of congruence between needs as conceived by the individual and as established by social custom and tradition how is information acquired how is it generated and diffused we have to assume that much of popular culture is the most subtle form of propaganda in jacques ellul definition of that term the mass media systems to which most people are exposed provide carefully structured messages all of which are of cultural significance and most of which are directly or indirectly related to the economic system the purpose of these messages is to control behavior and in toto they constitute a pervasive informational environment from which escape is next to impossible it is an area full of paradoxes for example messages designed for one purpose eg to assemble an audience to advertise a product may have certain noneconomic externalities that are socially undesirable eg crime alienation violence messages heretofore thought to be harmless escape mechanisms eg gothic novels may in fact be symbolic affirmations of current social roles and structures the ultimate impact of mass produced popular culture on the quality of life in the united states is not known the idea that there is even a connection between the two is relatively new when social indicators were first introduced social scientists developed measurement tools that could conceivably give high positive ratings to a society which winter 
  journal of education for library and information science at the same time could be a living nightmare a somewhat more humanistic way of measuring the quality of life is emerging from the development of cultural indicators in studying television programs as a demonstration case for the source of such indicators george gerbner wrote we know next to nothing about the trends in the composition of mass produced message systems that govern men lives and inform men minds in urbanized societies gerbner is interested in studying the prevailing symbolic environment and this is the crossroads where popular culture studies mass communications research sociology librarianship and other disciplines meet in the common enterprise of trying to understand how information flows through society what factors shape this flow and how it interacts with individuals and institutions information needs the symbolic environment particularly as perpetuated in the popular culture of the mass media is a major factor  though certainly not the only factor  in shaping the structure of information needs as conceived by the individual in the social milieu both the terms information and needs have to be defined within the context of popular culture the first term information really defies definition and we can only construct tentative working definitions appropriate for specific contexts for the purpose of a study of popular culture it seems useful to begin by defining information in terms of how and why people use it rather than by objective categorizations based on content of course sooner or later content has to be categorized and techniques of content analysis must be used hard or factual information is not a problem but most popular culture does not deal with hard or factual information though it may appear to do so and we have to assume that most of it has a second level of significance it is at this second level that basic human drives and fears can be exploited created or manipulated one of the most overworked clichés of librarianship is the statement that libraries exist to serve the needs of users this is not the place to examine the full ramifications of this statement however it is clear that we have to consider who is defining these needs and make a distinction between the librarian definition of needs and the needs of individuals as evidenced in their behavior  that is in their own selection and use of information sources this is not to say that librarians cannot or should not make subjective judgments about what they think the needs of people should be but this is another matter i am only saying that popular culture no matter how debased or corrupt we may think it is does indeed fulfill some needs of those who consume it specific goals there are a number of legitimate goals that could be established for a library oriented course in popular culture one could for example think of it as an alternate or counter humanities literature course with goals comparable to those of traditional humanities literature courses but dealing with popular materials in part the course at albany uses this approach however the important issues deal with students attitudes toward the materials and the people who use the materials the goals of the albany course are as follows  to force students to look objectively at their own popular culture milieu examine how they have used popular culture and try to determine how it has affected them  to understand something of the nature of public communications in relationship to democratic myths and values and from a study of popular culture draw inferences about the nature of these beliefs and values volume  number 
popular culture studies and library education    to develop approaches to other systems of popular culture particularly those of minority groups with a view to understanding what values and lifestyles they mirror and  to develop criteria for determining the relationship between libraries and popular culture materials central to several of these goals has to be an attempt to convince students that their perception of the good and the beautiful is entirely a product of factors in their own lives the students are themselves products of as much as twenty years of concentrated exposure to popular culture disseminated through the mass media for them to study this phenomenon objectively creates tremendous problems students who for example like to read science fiction usually believe that gothic novels and western pulp fiction are quite inane their assumption is that they themselves have made some sort of rational choice in preferring the one genre to the others they would attribute this to what b f skinner has identified as the autonomous man the assumption of skinner and of the course is that the autonomous man is a self delusion in teaching the course i assume that my students for the most part do not know in any rational sense the very culture in which they are immersed and that has played a part in shaping their own individual images of themselves and the world in which they live the popular culture process is a subtle play of symbols and meanings that are experienced one does not think about popular culture one responds to it and in the process behavior is reinforced and values strengthened i assume that my students are products of informational environments over which they have had little or no control and that most of their education both formal and informal has been advertising or propaganda pure and simple i assume that what they are and what they conceive themselves to be are largely fictions fabrications constructed from a vast array of message systems to which they have been exposed whether or not one agrees with this  and my own experience in teaching lends credence to skinner behaviorism  it is a useful stance to take in encouraging students to consider their future roles they need to think about where they as unique individuals fit into an information transfer process that involves the cultural milieu of libraries the structure of the world as experienced by a variety of potential library users and the library as a sociopolitical institution i suggest to students that they seriously consider the possibility that in the real world no one cares one way or another what they happen to personally like or dislike except to the extent that their values facilitate or inhibit communication foundations popular culture message systems have to be considered within the framework of several conceptual models one way or another some of the basic concepts outlined in standard texts eg berlo or lin must be known to students j h shera work provides a fine foundation with the added advantages of the author bibliographical perspective and searching discussions of information culture and libraries but what is done here and how it is done obviously depend on the nature of a school required courses and what is taught in other communications courses to which students have access at the library school in albany for the past several years the same instructor has taught both the popular culture course and a course called the communications process thus permitting a nice alignment of two approaches to public communications systems ideally the course in the communications process would be a prerequisite for the popular culture course but this is winter 
 journal of education for library and information science not possible and since both courses are electives it is necessary to examine some fundamental principles in both courses while at the same time keeping duplication to a minimum the general communications course is described in the school catalog as follows lib  the communications process study of several models and points of view of communications agencies engaged in the production and distribution of knowledge comparison of media analysis of content characteristics of audiences effects of exposure emphasis on the role of reading and libraries in the communication complex and the problems of intellectual freedom this is essentially correct except that the emphasis is not on reading this course emphasizes theory and deals in some detail with mass communications with a more or less traditional approach as william stephenson has pointed out from its beginning in  mass communication theory has concerned itself primarily with how the mass media influence attitudes beliefs and actions of people but a clear distinction was made between types of messages studied as e katz and d foulkes wrote it is a most intriguing fact in the intellectual history of social research that the choice was made to study media as agents of persuasion rather than entertainment thus eliminating most popular culture from mass communications research this dichotomy apparently deeply ingrained in academic tradition is obviously false or misleading at best and would not stand up under close scrutiny in any case a course in popular culture communications systems could deal with the material identified by katz and foulkes as entertainment and still be firmly based on the general principles that currently are used in mass communications studies practical matters of teaching as a a berger has pointed out there are two basic methods of studying popular culture you can see what others have written about it or you can analyze it yourself and r s denisoff wrote that popular culture can and should be approached in many different ways there is no one technique which is notably superior to another yet the special aims of library education and the general characteristics of students currently attracted to library schools can obviously provide a general framework for establishing appropriate approaches to the material at a fairly superficial and practical level we can identify certain traditional functions of libraries that require types of knowledge and skills related to the work of collecting organizing and disseminating knowledge familiarity with basic reference sources experience with current and retrospective bibliographical tools techniques of collection building problems of organization and knowledge of user characteristics i have to assume that students have already acquired or soon will acquire skills and knowledge in other courses that will provide approaches to these problems as they relate to popular culture on the other hand i have discovered that the students goals in taking the course are sometimes different from my goals in teaching the course their goals are practical and pragmatic some attention to the practical dimensions of popular culture helps to counterbalance what they take to be an overemphasis on its theoretical dimensions without wanting to suggest that i have found solutions to the more difficult problems of teaching the course or that procedures that work for me will work for other instructors i will briefly comment on my own approach and some of the problems that i have had in trying to achieve my goals volume  number 
popular culture studies and library education  i have used as a textbook russell nye the unembarrassed muse and required that students read about twothirds of it omitting sections on young adult literature and types of popular culture that are clearly beyond the purview of the library it is not always possible to coordinate the nye readings with my lectures in any case nye historical and descriptive approach is intended as background reading and we seldom discuss it in class after introductory lectures devoted to defining the field and the purpose of the course i try to demonstrate how values and beliefs are manifested in popular culture then in so far as possible each example of popular culture that we subsequently examine is considered from the point of view of values whatever unity the course has emerges from the continual reference to value systems early in the course i have asked students to read one gothic novel analyzing it from the point of view of joanna russ study of gothics and two novels each from the genres of the western science fiction and crime in each case using analytical reference points drawn from the literature about popular fiction i have had a unit on popular magazines and required that students make an analytical study of one of the popular supermarket or drugstore type of magazines this involves some preliminary discussion of advertising and for this there is a considerable amount of good background material i have used required readings by berger and b h nelson in the earlier versions of the course i tried to avoid placing any special emphasis on one area in which i have had a long standing interest recorded music however i am now convinced that given the proper theoretical underpinnings and a solid conceptual framework the fundamental aims of the course can be achieved with any one of a variety of different approaches in regard to the choice of material  a heavy emphasis on a limited number of media  a concentration on the messages disseminated by one medium eg recorded sound or print and  no emphasis on any specific medium but with a strictly thematic approach by thematic approach i mean the identification of some rather specific topics or perspectives followed by the analysis of a variety of popular culture artifacts from different media a few such themes are the role of women eg in the gothic novel in country and western music in television soap operas in advertising etc the concept of authority crime criminals and victims the nature of work in society romantic love and the nature of success the thematic approach has much to recommend it and i have never considered the approach by media to be anything more than an expedient however i am reluctant to abandon a media perspective entirely because there is so much that students need to know about media processes they need to consider the complex relationship between media and content and the extent to which each specific medium imposes its own laws on the nature of content and the extent to which each has its own system of interacting with the human mind another advantage of the media approach is the opportunity to examine the specific economic backgrounds of the different media  that is the peculiar chemistry of economic processes that in the end accounts for what messages are actually produced and disseminated this it seems to me is extremely important for the competitive marketing system that influences production may have cultural spin offs that are completely antithetical to the cultural aims of a specific library by and large the extent to which the course is successful does not seem to winter 
 journal of education for library and information science depend on some of the details of content or approach at least this seems to be the case from the point of view of the students since my own goals are less tangible and more difficult to measure than those of the students i generally finish the course with a certain frustration i have experienced some difficulty in presenting to my students some of the basic sociological concepts i find for example p l berger work on social knowledge and h d duncan work on symbolic transformation to be quite relevant to the course yet if such material is to have any meaningful impact on students it seems it must be related to their experiences in other words what does it have to do with bob dylan or carly simon since the bulk of my students seem to lack a broad ongoing interest in sociology and are not particularly enthusiastic about abstract thinking it seems best to introduce a limited number of these concepts in relation to specific examples of popular culture what can be done here and how it is done are entirely dependent on the background resources and interests of the instructor at various times in teaching the course i have drawn very selectively on concepts and theories of democratic myths and ideologies behavior in public places authoritarianism propaganda the achievement motive and the sociology of the absurd i have found much relevant material on popular images in the works of d j boorstin and k e boulding and of course in the work of m mcluhan particularly the mechanical bride and e carpenter whose book they became what they beheld fascinates students some problems emerge when one begins to take students outside of their own symbolic environment i am convinced however that this experience should be part of their education students cannot fully appreciate the extent to which their responses to their own popular culture are automatic and mindless until they have made an attempt to unravel the significance of symbol systems from outside of their own environments for this reason i have generally tried to make at least two excursions outside of the current mainstream cultural milieu these have been studies of the race records eg commercial sound recordings for black minorities of the s and s and early commercial country and western music it is in examining these materials which though historical are clearly related to current popular cultures that the students are confronted with message systems that are emotionally alien to them real communication breaks down immediately messages that are deadly serious are thought by the students to be funny when the material is humorous the students laugh at the wrong things for the wrong reasons in dealing with these materials one point has consistently emerged with shattering force the students are prejudiced toward systems of communication of cultural minorities their initial reaction for example to blues and gospel music of willie johnson has been frightening in the extreme exposing deep pervasive ignorances of monumental proportions i take it that this is not necessarily insensitivity to human emotions but rather unfamiliarity with the idiom style and symbols that surround the messages it is comparable to exposing students to chinese opera but with one important difference chinese opera is so alien to the students that about all that is transmitted is a disorganized mass of noise in the case of popular culture of minorities there are some common symbols but the whole message is distorted grotesquely as it is filtered through the students lifetime conditioning by mass media culture the inescapable conclusion is that the students reactions to the artifacts and messages of volume  number 
popular culture studies and library education  their own cultural milieu are purely spontaneous and irrational an examination of these historical documents also provides excellent material for the comparative analysis of value systems and can be used to demonstrate the impact of technology on the evolution of popular culture during the past four decades content analysis some form of content analysis obviously is indispensable in any library school curriculum how could one classify or subject catalog without analyzing the content of documents but formal content analysis techniques as used in communications research are another matter by and large it has been my experience that when first introduced to content analysis most students are quite intrigued but this fascination begins to dissipate rather rapidly when one begins to deal with quantitative research the study of popular culture however is hardly possible without at least some knowledge of content analysis my own aims are to make students reasonably intelligent consumers of content analysis research and introduce them to its broad outlines and a few specific techniques the construction of categories for example seems to be one of the most immediately useful techniques and there are several good introductions to these techniques t f carney and  r holsti for example throughout the course whenever possible i include required readings from related content analysis research nonquantitative content analysis studies however prove to be more attractive to students and these are no less valuable because they are not quantitative such works as l chenoweth examination of jimi hendrix and the jefferson airplane and w mellers study of the beatles are good examples of indispensable nonquantitative content analysis the good and the beautiful a problem that has to be dealt with is the academic criteria for evaluating literature most students bring to popular literature a whole set of a priori assumptions about what is good and what is bad in their discussions of popular literature they like to demonstrate their critical facilities and high standards by making such statements as the plot is weak the book is poorly written the characters are one dimensional stereotypes such comments are completely irrelevant to the course for they say nothing useful about why millions of people read popular fiction the systems of values that it projects or its symbolic significance thus developing an approach to popular literature involves training students to avoid falling into the trap of responding with meaningless undergraduate clichés which in any case are a poor substitute for thinking but in the end the issue of popular versus elite culture essentially the good versus the bad cannot be avoided a discussion of salient points in this long controversy provides effective issues around which to summarize the course and consider the role of the librarian and the library in relationship to current mass culture toward the end of the course after having held aesthetic judgments in abeyance while trying to understand the processes and functions of popular culture it is good to return to the literature that variously attacks and defends popular culture here one can discuss basic issues while students bring into play their own concepts of the good and the beautiful as background reading i have used material by w h gass j ortega y gasset e van den haag j g cawelti and r hoggart other approaches in studying popular culture nothing is sacred least of all a commitment to any single syllabus the field is vast the equipment any single instructor brings to such a course is winter 
 journal of education for library and information science usually a unique one with special possibilities and limitations and the students themselves are variously equipped with intellectual tools and attitudes necessary to study popular culture there is probably no other area of higher education that lends itself to such a variety of approaches and methods an indispensable sourcebook for the instructor planning a popular culture course for the first time is popular culture and curricula by r b browne and r j ambrosetti the quarterly publication of the popular culture association popular culture methods will keep one informed of recent developments in teaching various aspects of popular culture a course for librarians devoted exclusively to popular literature could be built around one of the anthologies of primary source material the popular culture explosion by browne and d madden is excellent the more recent anthology by d mcquade and r atwan could also serve as a text but would involve committing the entire course to the printed word both of these texts have fine instructor manuals that i have found most useful in framing my own questions about popular culture finally a gowans book the unchanging arts deals with contemporary pictorial arts within the framework of the author remarkably persuasive arguments about the role of the popular arts in contemporary society the work would serve as a fine text but in any case should be read by anyone teaching a course in popular culture conclusion education for librarianship has managed to survive for a long time without the use of studies in popular culture and doubtless this will remain the case in many library schools for a long time to come many of the goals of the course at albany could probably be achieved in other courses and by other means on the other hand teaching some of the fundamentals of communications processes within the context of popular culture and using it as a vehicle to get at the more subtle issues of librarianship can be a very rewarding experience both for the instructor and the students within the context of popular culture communications one can discuss the profoundest of sociological concepts and raise basic theoretical and practical issues about the cultural functions of libraries one can do this while working with subject matter that fascinates students and in an atmosphere that encourages both introspection and empathy references  state university of new york at albany school of library and information science bulletin  in press  j a clarke popular culture in libraries college  research libraries  may     state university of new york at albany school of library and information science special courses mimeographed spring   c w mills the power elite new york oxford univ pr    h i schiller the mind managers boston beacon pr   j ellul propaganda new york alfred a knopf   g gerbner cultural indicators the case of violence in television drama annals of the american academy of political and social science  march    b f skinner beyond freedom and dignity new york alfred a knopf   d k berlo the process of communication new york holt rinehart and winston  n lin the study of human communication indianapolis bobbs merrill   j h shera the foundations of education for librarianship new york becker and hayes  volume  number
