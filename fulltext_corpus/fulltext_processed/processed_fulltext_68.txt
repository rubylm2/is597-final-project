be slow skeptical and classify recommendations for lis education  educators is to form a response to this overwhelming integration of their language and expertise into the everyday activities of lay people which competences are required for librarians and information professionals in a world where everyone does information work every day in this paper i propose that the medium for information provision ought to become the central phenomenon in library and information science lis i argue that the fields dominating paradigm of providing fast efficient and neutral systems for information retrieval has sidetracked the field at the expense of explorations into the medium used to facilitate access to information in this paper i propose three concrete recommendations that lis educators can take to redirect lis education to become central in todays media landscape a first and more principled move is to leave behind the fields allegiance to neutrality as a core value common to the three recommendations i make is that they regard the medium as being inherently political and ethical and that they view the medium as shaping information and communication i propose that library and information science educators teach students to be skeptics that is to educate future librarians and information professionals to know that there are multiple answers to open questions and to design systems and provide services that allow patrons to locate multiple perspectives on open questionsand the correct answer to closed questions library and information science educators should slow read systems techniques and platforms for information provision and show students how and in which ways the specific information medium shapes the interaction and the information provided to users lastly i propose that future librarians and information professionals need to understand classification at a much more foundational level to appreciate how categories are part of culture cognition and language and that they are the foundation for any interaction with information through catalogs search engines or social media neutrality as a value proposition library and information science has historically been institutionspecific and medium neutral the field has formed its identity around activities organizing seeking retrieving using information that take place in specific institutions libraries or library like and the field has viewed the medium catalog online search service classification system cataloging rules librarian used for the activities as a neutral intermediary that facilitates the connection and communication between information and user the result has been a field that has constrained itself to activities in specific institutions with the goal of improving the interaction between user and the requested information and between the user and the information system until recently the sole focus of educational programs was to provide students with competences to employ the tools used in these institutions in order to prepare them for a
 mai future in a specific professional setting library and information science programs were essentially professional e ducational programs that provided students with the needed competences to succeed in a specific workplace context the mission for librarians and libraries was for many decades along the following lines we can or should try to produce the one best classification system that will serve all purposes miksa  p  with the ideal of achieving international bibliographic control miksa  p  this mission was supported by the fundamental belief that information systems should reflect the universe of knowledge it was assumed or taken for granted that a universe of knowledge exists and that library systems ought to be designed such that they represent this universe of knowledge and ultimately give access the universe of knowledge it this sense the medium used to organize the universe of knowledge was without consequences the universe of knowledge is what it is regardless of which medium was used to represent the universe of knowledge it did not matter whether the universe of knowledge was represented via a card catalog an online catalog or a search engine an enumerative facetted post coordinated or pre coordinated system the goal was the same to create a system that serves all users and all content it was silently assumed that the medium itself had no impact or influence on the representation and presentation of the universe of knowledge what mattered was which medium would create the best and most efficient access to information for the users the only criterion employed to differentiate between different media was to measure speed and efficiency this notion of medium neutrality is also reflected in the very definitions and understandings of information science borko  offered a definition of the field in his now classic paper information science what is it which more or less has become the standard definition and understanding of the field information science is a discipline that investigates the properties and behavior of information the forces governing the flow of information and the means of processing information for optimum accessibility and usability it is concerned with that body of knowledge relating to the origination collection organization storage retrieval interpretation transmission transformation and utilization of information this includes the investigation of information representations in both natural and artificial systems the use of codes for efficient message transmission and the study of information processing devices and techniques such as computers and their programming systems borko  p  saracevics  much cited definition of the field echoes borkos understanding of lis as being concerned with processes and procedures

 mai to organize books on shelves as miksa notes library classificationists in the early twentieth century perceived that their task had everything to do with practicality and very little to do with philosophical speculations about knowledge  p  and as such a core belief of the field was formed not out of a theoretical work and principled discussions but out of melvin deweys eureka moment one sunday morning while listening to a long sermon wiegand   deweys idea was a practical solution to a customer service problem at the time a book would have different call numbers in different librariesthis was confusing to patrons instead dewey suggested call numbers should be constructed according to the books topics placement in the universe of knowledge and not according to the books physical placement in libraries unfortunately this practical solution to a philosophical problem has had a lasting impact on the fields self understanding in miksas  review of the two classic textbooks in cataloging and classificationlois mai chans cataloging and classification an introduction  and arlene taylors introduction to cataloging and classification he finds that cataloging and classification focus almost exclusively on technical procedures and that the two books do not include anything that would inspire the reader to view cataloging and classification as worthwhile even inspiring endeavors p  he ends his review by saying finally there is the matter of creating a unified rationale for cataloging and classification that would not simply recognize the past and the present but also offer reasonable inspiration for the future mention has already been made of the reality that no present text offers such a rationale in this respect the chan and taylor texts despite all of their strengths seem tired when it comes to eliciting such a vision that they are is not so much a fault of the authors however as much as it reflects the contemporary climate of thought in library cataloging and classification at some point between manns text ie introduction to cataloging and the classification of books from  and the appearance of new texts since the s cataloging and classification had already started down the road of being thought of only or merely as access mechanisms without the complications and implications that arise from their relationship to the origin character and organization of humankinds knowledge the latter is to say the least a striking social phenomenon in its own right and given its extraordinary nature i cannot help but think how grand a change would occur in texts on cataloging and classification were they to capture at least some of that extraordinary character in their vision p  it is concerning that at a time when everyone speaks in the lexicon of information science and where the organization of and search for

 mai science one of them being save the time of the reader and cutters  objects of the catalog were concerned with easing access by enabling the user to find what they are seeking to show what the library has and to assist in the choice of exemplar later wilson  p  spoke about the objective of libraries and information systems as having the power to produce the best textual means to ones end in fact ruthven  p  argues that because there is now more information and more sources of information available the ability to extract useful information from large electronic resources not only is one of the main activities of individuals online but is an essential skill for most professional groups and a means of achieving competitive advantage in other words the focus for the field has been on making information available easier faster and better feinberg  p  while the paradigm of fast and effective systems for retrieving information has served the library and information science field well for more than a century the field also has a century worth of experiences in the challenges and impossibility of creating neutral and objective information systems those experiences are today more needed than ever therefore if one were to shift the almost single minded focus away from the fast effective retrieval paradigm that has dominated library and information science and instead focus on the medium used for the information organizing seeking seeking and retrieving activities then lis could gain relevance as the primary field for the study of the consequences of the digital information society the field has gained experience and expertise in understanding the challenges of maintaining a belief in objectivity and neutrality and it has realized the importance of understanding context culture and situation as the foundation for information provision in fact speed and efficiency are not as important as understanding didactics and users lived experiences in other words what is important today is a focus on the technological political and ethical dynamics that have created the particular medium employed in information provision there are good reasons for such a focus on the mediumthe institutions libraries and tech giants alike that provide information to the public possess immense powers they have the powers to decide which information to include and exclude from their search results how to describe the information how to make the information available and how to rank the search results as such these institutions have the power to ensure which public impressions become permanent and which remain fleeting pasquale  p  they hold the power over what information people are provided with as a society we therefore have an obligation to study understand and discuss the principles by which these institutions make information available to us while contemporary search engines are difficulty to grasp technologically and most are trade secrets it is important that we appreciate the immense impact they have on society as they have become the default mode of knowledge acquisition chun  p

 mai of course you are not interested in what just anyone says about who is worth listening to you want to know whose opinions on that question are worth taking seriously i take no position on that matter though i can tell you who the different people are and what they say about why they should be attended to if you want more than that i can tell you only what people say you want a guarantee or at least a recommendation from me but i give no guarantees and make no recommendations you fear that if you believe this one rather than that you may be misplacing your trust as to that it appears to me that you may well be right  p  in other words a trustworthy information system is one that strives to be an authority on authorities wilson  p  and one that can determine which resources can be trusted on a given topic which resources are of high quality which views are in the minority which views can be ignored and which view is the majority view such information systems are important because most of our knowledge about the world is what we have second hand from others p it is all hearsay p but not all hearsay is equally reliable p  because while some people know what they are talking about others do not those who do are my cognitive authorities p  libraries and information systems ought to strive to become cognitive authorities that is institutions that people turn to for advice and information and that influence their thinking about the world it is not enough to provide answers to closed questions the real challenge is how to address open questions in a world of uncertainty alternative facts and diverse world views a strength of librarians and information professionals could be exactly noting the counterargument for every argument wilson  p  and seeking to provide services and to design information systems that strive for such skepticism the basic criteria for a skeptical information system would be to never settle for an answer to help and facilitate the users to keep exploring so that they understand their question is in indeed open and that there are competing answers to the question that different people have different answers but also that these people speak with varying degrees of authority recommendation  slow down one direct way to challenge the notion of medium neutrality is to read the medium used to facilitate access to information be it a search engine a classification system or a database feinberg  provides a systematic approach to such an exercise which she calls slow information p  as opposed to the focus on outcome oriented retrieval interactions fast information p  and as such the idea of reading databases is broader than retrieval p  it is not that retrieval does not matterin
be slow skeptical and classify recommendations for lis education  fact it does matter a lotit is just that there is much more to databases than providing access and facilitating retrieval many of the everyday information systems that we encounter    are more than mere repositories and we do more with these systems than just retrieve items from them why do people read maps for places they have never been and do not plan to visit it is because the map itself is more than a repository of routes it is a mechanism for synthesizing structuring and interpreting information importantly using maps for more than navigation is not unusual in fact it is so common and typical that it seems strange to insist that we do more with maps than search them to extract their facts of course we interact with maps in diverse ways so why does information studies research continues to focus predominantly on using search engines for task oriented information seeking and retrieval we do more with information systems than search them and there are many more kinds of information systems than search engines systems that we use every day from supermarkets maps and shoe shopping websites to photo albums facebook and twitter p  feinberg explores how various databases information systems might be read to gain an understanding of a phenomenonfor instance she suggests that one can use google maps not just to find out how one might get from point a to point b but also to investigate an unfamiliar neighborhood or see how various neighborhoods relate to each other to make sense of a guidebooks descriptions and one can compare google maps rendering of place with public transportation maps maps of inexpensive restaurants or historical maps p  the possibilities are endless feinberg  argues likewise that a search in googles search engine that might appear simple and straightforward does in fact require selection work on the part of the user for many retrieval interactions this reliance on the searchers labor is not noticed or is perceived as trivial because the need is simple and concrete and few sources are required p  a slow information approach would explore how to facilitate the users selection labor and understand how the larger infrastructure works including the implicit cultural and social conceptual spaces that frames the meanings and understandings involved in the construction and use of the search engine in another example feinberg explores a commercial website that sells shoes to understand how that website employs particular terms related to shoes in her interrogation she uncovers how terms that at the surface might appear simple and straightforward in fact do have particular meanings in the universe of the website as such a slow information approach and reading of databases supplements and augments a more traditional fast information approach slow information provides unique insight into the information system and
