pv toward a new model of the information professions embracing empowerment mary niles maack in redefining the information professions for the twenty first century it is important to consider the core values embraced by these fields and to examine the relationship of professionals to their clients and to other professions because other models have failed to take account of professional client interaction this paper presents a new client centered typology of the professions special emphasis is given to the empowering professions such as psychology social work education and librarianship which all share the goal of enabling their clients to use knowledge for the purpose of taking control of their own lives after offering a critique of the unquestioned assumptions and androcentric biases underlying modern theories of professionalization this article presents a feminist perspective that validates the ethic of care in professional practice and acknowledges the importance of those professional activities whose goal is to diffuse knowledge not to guard or control it in the past our understanding of the information professions has been marred by the use of the traditional or liberal professions as a model for example sociological literature utilizing the trait model of professionalization operated on the assumption that unless occupations such as librarianship engineering or social work matched characteristics of law or medicine they could not be classified as true professions scholars taking this approach often dismissed all fields that emphasized caring or intellectual nurturing as service professions and as recently as  a group of highly regarded sociologists led by etzioni relegated most female intensive fields to the domain of semi professions nearly a decade later in his well reviewed book the culture of professionalism historian bledstein emphasized the masculine character of the professions stating that the professional claim of authority derived from a special power over worldly experience a command over the profundities of the discipline such masterful command was designed to establish confidence in the mind of the helpless client while more recent publications by scholars such as reeves abbot and friedson have introduced a broader more sophisticated analysis of the professions these writers also employ an androcentric perspective focusing on issues such as jurisdictional competition exclusivity in the creation and control of an esoteric body of knowledge and legal control over entry into the field although social theorists have used a variety of approaches to the study of fall

embracing empowerment  where the emphasis is on sharing knowledge with the client rather than on cognitive exclusivity furthermore i believe that a meaningful analysis of the professions must examine the relationship between professionals and their clients focusing on the desired outcome of that interaction rather than on the exclusivity of the knowledge base or on the mechanisms maintained for control over who has access to that knowledge using a client centered approach i have developed a multidimensional typology that applies to the full range of professions this typology presents the world of the professions from the standpoint of practitioners and the clients they serve rather than from the abstract perspective of the sociologist or historian see table  in this model each category consists of a constellation of professions that share a particular client orientation and may also share similar goals and values see table  in addition the model takes into account the fact that those working in certain subfields within a given profession may sometimes have a client relationship similar to that of professionals placed in a different category for example within the information professions those who are reference librarians archivists or children librarians deal directly with the public whereas others who work as systems analysts catalogers indexers or abstractors have a much more indirect relationship with clients  many of whom they may never see in a sense catalogers might be thought of as boundary spanners whose values and training are anchored in library and information science while the work they produce in some ways is similar to that done by programmers scholars or engineers whose focus is on products rather than on personal intervention however despite their responsibilities for creating a print or electronic product catalogers are also part of an empowering profession because they like their colleagues in public service embrace core values and overarching goals such as facilitating independent learning and freely providing access to knowledge and resources needed by the clients this new client oriented framework differs radically from the dominant approaches to social theory presented in michael winter excellent review of sociological literature on the professions see table   in his analysis of the work of sociologists who represent different schools of thought winter demonstrates that although trait theorists focus on the individual practitioner while functionalists stress institutions and occupational control theorists emphasize the role of the reference group none of these models detable  attitudes toward professional knowledge and outcomes of its use fall  authoritarian relationship empowering relationship indirect relationship cognitive exclusiveness knowledge mediation and cognitive exclusiveness sharing monopoly of judgment partnership in decision making monopoly of technical expertise goal is to resolve the client goal is to promote the client goal is to create a physical or problem growth and competence intellectual product clients remain dependent on clients workprogress toward clients remain dependent on the knowledge and services of greater autonomy the products of professional the professional expertise

embracing empowerment  university based instruction as a criterion for inclusion it provides a framework that is limited to those occupations where learning is key definitions are important in establishing our understanding of the world but models like metaphors and images can also have a profound effect on the way we perceive relationships as the sociologist jonathan turner remarks a model provides a means to represent visually a phenomenon in a way that exposes its underlying properties and their interconnections he goes on to note that although the term model is highly ambiguous in the social sciences models have been used in social theory to present concepts and their relations  as a visual picture that maps properties of the social universe and their interrelations building on the mapping metaphor it is apparent that like a flat map that represents three dimensional space any model can only partially represent reality however models like the north oriented maps we carry in our heads frame the way we think and act thus becoming part of a conceptual system that unconsciously plays a central role in defining our everyday realities by the same token collective selfimage practices and strategies for improvement in diverse fields have been shaped by a conceptual system based on a highly authoritarian model of professionalism  despite this model inappropriateness to their philosophy of service or to the nature of their practice one striking example occurred in the social work field when abraham flexner an educator who was known for his highly critical evaluation of medical training was invited to address a national conference of charities and corrections in  at that historic meeting he declared that a profession must be teachable learnable self policing altruistic and socially useful he also emphasized that although professionals derive their raw material from science and learning this knowledge must be applied in a way that transcends rigid and mechanical application of rules what matters most is professional spirit however despite what appeared to be an open definition inclusive of new fields that had emerged at the end of the nineteenth century flexner asserted that social workers had only arrived at the beginning stages of professionalization and concluded that because social work mediated between other professions it did not have the responsibility and power of a true profession the durable influence that flexner exerted has been noted by many scholars including philip popple who observed seventy years later traditional sociology of the professions with its emphasis on cognitive exclusivity has yielded dysfunctional results for social work developing this point further popple continued because of the large number of exceptions to the current models of professions we must conclude that there is something wrong with each of these models all of them to date be they trait process or power basically follow flexner  example they assign primary importance to skill based on exclusive intellectual knowledge applied to some problem    because of this skill and knowledge the profession is seen as winning control of a domain and acquiring the autonomy to practice within the domain from the early years of this century to the present most of the supposedly objective social science literature was replete with undefined key words related to professional power  both in regard to power over the client and exclusive control over a body of knowledge the frequent use of terms such as hegemony fall 
 journal of education for library and information science dominance monopoly of discourse and social control was criticized by sociologist eliot friedson who dismisses such words as part of a colorful rhetoric that exercises the imagination by its connotations but that does not allow actual connection with concrete human events and experiences high authority professions as the model although few social theorists have been as blunt as nathan glazer who declared that law and medicine alone were the major professions those two fields have often been set apart from and above other occupations while glazer used the term minor professions to describe other fields amitai etzioni designated teachers librarians and social workers as semi professionals partly because they were rarely directly concerned with matters of life and death it may be true that the prestige of lawyers and physicians are linked to their intervention at times of crisis but theorists have tended to ignore the fact that a large majority of those who practice in these fields spend their time performing work of a much more mundane nature lawyers obviously devote more billable hours to legal research than to time in court and relatively few doctors spend their careers performing major surgery or working in an emergency room in fact matthew dumont an md from the national institute of mental health noted that at least  percent of the physician patient contacts are for functional complaints where there is no organic pathology as in other fields work in crisis situations varies by specialty it is therefore reasonable to argue that social workers or psychologists employed in suicide prevention centers handle more life threatening cases than plastic surgeons ophthalmologists or corporate lawyers even when lawyers and doctors are not dealing with life anddeath issues they nonetheless exercise authority over their clients differently than most other professionals in his history of american medicine paul starr differentiates between two distinct but interrelated kinds of professional authority social authority that involves the control of action through the giving of commands and cultural authority that entails the construction of reality through definitions of fact and value in analyzing physicians use of these two kinds of authority starr also discusses the voluntary nature of the doctor patient relationship a doctor may tell a patient that if he does not stop smoking  he will not have long to live the patient may take this as an authoritative judgment but decline to follow the advice here the physician cultural authority exceeds his social authority this is quite commonly the case physicians insofar as they deal with voluntary patients generally do not have the coercive powers of the state to enforce either their definitions of reality or their instructions judges rule physicians usually advise starr goes on to note that while such advice is not coercive it is often advice that one can not safely ignore even though both lawyers and physicians lack coercive power over most of their clients in a free market system because much of the knowledge they use in their practice is highly technical and specialized they are able to maintain what sociologist magali larson refers to as cognitive exclusiveness this exclusivity has not only been maintained as a means to control entry into the field it has also served as a way of closely guarding knowledge that might be both understandable and useful to the client blatant volume  number 
embracing empowerment  historical examples of this are found in dr dw cathell manual the physician himselfa popular guide for medical practice that went through numerous editions beginning in  in regard to therapy and pharmaceuticals dr cathell offered the following advice especially avoid giving self sufficient people therapeutic points that they can resort to  it is not your duty to cheat yourself or other physicians by supplying this person and that one with a word of mouth pharmacopoeia for general use  if compelled to give a person remedies under a simple form    use whatever strategies necessary to prevent such a person from taking advantage of your prescriptions the use of latin names for simple compounds like carbolic acid and even transposing the terms were among the strategies that cathell recommended to physicians who sought to guard their knowledge from their patients such techniques of secrecy and obfuscation were later challenged by the public health movement and the introduction of preventive medicine brought radical changes that would have been anathema to cathell who wrote during a period when the american medical profession was consolidating its authority an even more dramatic alteration of the doctor patient relationship came nearly a century later in the wake of the adoption of the patients bill of rights by the american hospital association in  starr notes that recognized rights in health care such as informed consent obligate doctors and hospitals to share more information with patients thus the new health rights movement    challenged the distribution of power and expertise he then observes that the best illustration of the decline of medicine professional sovereignty is found in the increasing tendency during the s for the courts to view the doctor patient relationship as a partnership in decision making rather than a doctor monopoly despite the changing attitude toward informing and educating patients starr believes that a relationship of dependency still remains a key component of professional authority he writes the kind of authority claimed by the professions then involves not only skill in performing a service but also the capacity to judge the experience and needs of clients professional authority can be defined in part by a distinctive type of dependency condition  the dependence on the professional superior competence dependency is also a central theme in bledstein analysis of the consolidation of professional power during the last quarter of the nineteenth century bledstein notes that symbols of professional authority including the number of technical aids in the office of a successful practitioner reinforced the public consciousness of its dependence    practitioners succeeded by playing on the weaknesses of the client his vulnerability helplessness and general anxiety from this perspective because the client lack of professional knowledge fosters dependency the mastery of this knowledge becomes an intellectual commodity  not intellectual property in the sense that one has created the knowledge but property in that one has mastery and publicly recognized intellectual ownership gained through education experience andor credentialing indirect client relationships in productprocess oriented professions in the proposed client centered typology group two includes professionals who are very concerned about intellectual property because in many cases they apply knowledge to create products that may be copyrighted or patented the resulting work can be concrete literally  such as a bridge a highway or a building or it can be an intellectual fall

 journal of education for library and information science tively seek closer ties with these fields through partnerships teamwork and an exchange of knowledge we have much to learn from publications in psychology and social work that offer discussion of empowerment based practice with clients who are frequently among the populations that most need but least use our services library and information science professionals also can learn a great deal from counselors teachers and public health nurses engaged in client education programs the relationship should be reciprocal since practitioners in these fields can and should use information resources that we acquire organize and make available one example of collaborations across professions is a workshop for social workers organized by a state library literacy campaign the goal was to help these practitioners ree  ognize signs indicating that a client had low literacy skills and should be referred to a library literacy program in turn libraries that have community information centers or information and referral services should seek contacts with professionals in other human services fields to whom they may need to refer library users another reason for joining efforts with professionals who share our values is to enlist their support in a campaign to rename these fields as empowering professions taking a new name and forging a new collective identity with other client centered fields is far more than an exercise in semantics social work professors van der bergh and cooper stress that renaming includes reclaiming knowledge and pride in cultural historical and current experiences  to rename also means to expand the conceptual boundaries of words by going beyond conventional definitions applying the idea of renaming to empowerment based social work dubois and miley emphasize the importance of language words shape our thinking prescribe our interpretations and predispose our conclusions it stands to reason that if social work is to be an empowering profession then the words labels and metaphors social workers draw on to describe their work must promote strengths and facilitate empowerment how would it change the thinking of library and information science practitioners and students if they were to envision their field as client oriented active collaborative and empowering  not as a semi profession that can never fit the authoritarian model of professionalism assuming responsibility for change looking toward the twenty first century we in the library and information science field have affirmed our commitment to public access to information and through the information literacy movement we have sown the seed for a new understanding of professionalism while the final report of the ala presidential committee on information literacy expands the responsibility and enhances the self image of information professionals it also views information literacy as a means of personal empowerment thus information professionals have a catalytic role enabling individuals to gain knowledge to increase their skills in finding and organizing information and to develop a critical perspective that allows them to verify or refute expert opinion and to become independent seekers of truth this thinking is similar to the attitude toward professionals expressed by sociologist robert bellah and his colleagues who wrote in the good society we need experts and expert opinion and experts can certainly help volume  number 
embracing empowerment  us think about the important issues but democracy is not the rule of experts it is basic to the education of citizens that they learn how to evaluate expert opinion    weighing the moral implications of different options is what is essential by endorsing a skeptical and even subversive approach toward professional authority we have moved toward a new concept of professionalism that emphasizes shared critical thinking and partnership as well as problem solving the one certainty that the future holds for professionals is the expanding role of teaching and learning in all fields  not only in the empowering professions that promote autonomy but also in fields as diverse as medicine and city planning during the next century the idea of a learned profession must give way to the concept of a learning profession because of the enormous expansion of knowledge and information it becomes essential to teach future professionals to use a vast array of resources electronic print or human that will be essential to their continuing education sophie freud a social work professor states this well more important than teaching students everything they need to know which is a hopeless task is teaching them an attitude of being life long learners i believe an identity of an educator automatically implies a simultaneous self concept of learner by taking this approach  learning for with and from students and clients  we foster an openness to innovative thinking and a continuing source of empowerment for both ourselves and those with whom we work these ideas of connection mutuality and interdependence also reflect patterns and values that feminist psychologists have identified with women ways of thinking and knowing as mary field belenky and her colleagues point out women typically approach adulthood with the understanding that the care and empowerment of others is central to their life work through listening and responding they draw out the voices and minds of those they help to raise up in the process they often come to hear value and strengthen their own voices and minds as well the concept of an empowering profession incorporates these ideas and like gilligan work in moral reasoning the goal of this new approach is not to devalue other ways of thinking or other uses of expert knowledge but to recognize the validity of a different voice that adds a counterpoint to the discourse on the nature of professional practice while it may generally be appropriate for lawyers doctors engineers and architects to concentrate on solving problems  sharing little of their knowledge with clients  this mode of practice must be recognized as antithetical to fields like psychology teaching social work and librarianship in such fields professionals do not impart all of their knowledge to the student or client but rather view mature practice as understanding what knowledge will enable clients to empower themselves by proposing a client centered categorization of the professions my goal is to challenge the idea that the norm for all professions should be a single androcentric model of power and control anchored in hierarchical rather than collaborative relationships and replete with military metaphors i wholeheartedly endorse the view of british management professor judi marshall who calls for a radical approach to organizations taking nothing for granted looking critically at basic values and assumptions and identifying where however subtly they define male as positive and female as negative the aim of these processes fall 
 journal of education for library and information science is to develop new social and organizational foundations that value women and men equally    not rejecting the heritage we have but looking for the functions and creative potential of female and male patterns of being especially drawing from archetypal levels of understanding to go beyond the limits of social stereotypes if we take this radical approach as an invitation to re examine our heritage we must also include what winter describes as the philosophical underpinnings of professionalism he notes two of these root ideas are freedom and service and in a sense they are the fundamental notions of professional life    without the idea of service freedom falls into a form of self assertion and without the idea of freedom the notion of service becomes a form of servility as we move toward thinking of librarianship and information science as empowering professions rather than service professions we must still acknowledge the inequalities in the client professional relationship and the nature of professional autonomy let us discard hierarchical images and embrace new metaphors that reflect different definitions of expertise power and leadership after observing that women participating in their study of feminist leadership seldom spoke of power but preferred the term influence astin and leland offered a new definition of power as empowerment thus they conceive of power as an expandable resource that is produced and shared  as energy that transforms oneself and others    the effective leader as one who empowers others to act in their own interests only by coming to terms with how we as information professionals view power and exert leadership can we assume responsibility for change references  amitai etzioni ed the semi professions and their organization new york free press   burton bledstein the culture of professionalism the middle class and the development of higher education new york norton    andrew abbot the system of the professions an essay on the division of expert labor chicago univ of chicago pr  eliot friedson professional powers a study of the institutionalization of formal knowledge chicago univ of chicago pr  eliot friedson professionalism reborn theory prophesy and policy chicago univ of chicago pr  william j reeves librarians as professionals the occupations impact on library work arrangements lexington mass lexington books   michael f winter the culture and control of expertise westport conn greenwood    geoffrey millerson the qualifying associations a study in professionalization london routledge  paul  abbot the system of the professions friedson professional powers  quoted in friedson professional powers   jonathan turner analytical theorizing in social theory today anthony giddens and jonathan turner eds stanford calif stanford univ pr    for a fuller discussion of these points see george lakoff and mark johnson metaphors we live by chicago univ of chicago pr    abraham flexner is social work a profession in proceedings of the national conference of charities and corrections  chicago the hildmann printing co     brenda dubois and karla krogsrud miley social work an empowering profession d ed boston allyn and bacon   emphasis added  philip r popple the social work profession a reconceptualization social service review    see also r lubove the emergence of social work as volume  number
