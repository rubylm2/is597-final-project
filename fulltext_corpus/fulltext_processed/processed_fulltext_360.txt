mechanics and mercantile libraries  riding swiftly to power on the backs of french and english rationalism when there was a growing acceptance of the scientific method of the individualism so ably defended by locke and his successors in english thought and of the utilitarian philosophy which easily followed from the method of experimental science this was a period in which the faith in indefinite perfectibility left no excuse save ignorance for the failure of men and their institutions to show progress realizing that progress would proceed more rapidly by an interchange of individual thinking discussion groups such as the junto and the later more formal american philosophical society came into existence thus the intellectual activity of individuals could be pooled so as to constitute a means of consolidating and providing new bases from which inventive genius could proceed the idea of self help taken over from locke brought to the fore among other means of self education the obvious utility of books as media for disseminating knowledge to the self improving middle classs it was inevitable then that the signal convenience of pooling books should occur to the members of the junto for by thus clubbing our books to a common library we should  have each of us the advantage of using the books of all the other members which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole another advantage of placing the books together in one room was that they would be there ready to consult in our conferences membership in this library was almost immediately extended to include such citizens in the middle and lower walks of life who could afford a subscription rate which was considered moderate the humanitarianism of the middle class functional to its cohesiveness at the time as well as to the narrow economic  much of this material is treated in merle curti the social ideas of american educators new york charles scribner sons i pp    bigelow ed op cit p i  ibid i dutobiography of benjamin franklin new york arundel print  i pp i

mechanics and mercantile libraries o believe that many general subscription libraries were called mercantile because they were established in trading towns where the mercantile proportion of the community population predominated many communities had institutions of this kind which catered to both a mechanical and a commercial clientele but which were called by one or the other name in at least one place a mechanics library seems to have opened as a result of a misunderstanding of the nature of the local mercantile library however where in the larger cities two institutions existed side by side the mercantile libraries were organized and run with a social philosophy quite different from that of the apprentices libraries they were established in the early  not by the employer merchants but by groups of young clerks and merchants who were just starting in the profession another difference was that the libraries were at first the sole educational feature discussion groups and mutual improvement circles and museum features were added only after the mercantile library was well under way the introduction of lectures new york mercantile is first intimated in i  when one finds mention of a proposed building with a hall devoted to the purposes of teachers connected with our institution lecturers were invited to address the membership wealthy men were exhorted to endow annual lecture series and by  the lecture feature was firmly intrenched as an auxiliary service the new york mercantile library association was the outjames l goodknight evolution of the american library lincoln iii i p   san francisco mercantile libraryfirst annual report of thepresident ig  p   new york mercantile library association annual reports of the board of direction of the mercantile library association of the city of new york from izi to  new york reprinted for the association i p i  ibid p   ibid pp i  i john h gourlie an address delivered before the mercantile library association at its eighteenth annual meeting anuary   new york james van norden i pp i   the new york association is the basis of this treatment because of the availability and fulness of its reports although in the broad details of its history this association seems to typify the setup of others the writer offers it as a good example rather than as a type
