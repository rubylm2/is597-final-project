library school alumni publications susan s dimattia communication is the prime reason for the existence of library school alumni publications the editorial point of view tends to differ depending upon whether the publication is prepared solely by the library school administration or the alumni association or is a joint effort of the two however the purpose remains the same if graduates are to maintain close identity with their library school and to support it financially they must be kept abreast of curriculum and faculty changes the whereabouts of classmates and continuing education efforts being carried on by the school although some of this information is reported in the general press of the library world the most satisfactory vehicle is the direct mail personal approach of an alumni newsletter the simmons librarian originated in the spring of  and has been published at least twice a year since that time its purpose is to provide a vehicle of communication for the alumni association and the administration with the alumni of the simmons college school of library science although it has been nurtured by three successive editors and an assortment of faculty alumni and student writers during its short life the simmons librarian has rarely strayed from its original purpose recent articles in the simmons librarian have been concerned with a wide variety of topics the content of attendance at and responses dimattia is editor of the simmons librarian school of library science simmons college boston ma  
library school alumni publications to simmons new series of continuing education seminars were reviewed since the doctor of arts program is relatively new an article on subjects being researched by candidates for the degree helped our alumni better understand the aims and objectives of the program the annual fund drive features a direct mailing and a follow up mailing to all graduates each year in addition articles in the simmons librarian review the success of the previous year campaign cover the uses to which fund monies have been put and in general encourage readers to send a donation donations to the annual fund have increased substantially over the past three years with this year drive realizing  more than the goal amount the success is due to a combination of factors such as cooperation from the school development office and active dedication from the annual fund committee but also in large part because of the fund increased exposure in the alumni newsletter changes in the curriculum are frequently covered in the simmons librarian primarily so that our older alumni will be aware of the skills and specialties with which the younger professional competition is equipped major student news such as elections to beta phi mu is featured frequently we honor the achievements of our graduates by including them in the simmons librarian some of our outstanding graduates will be recognized in the national library press in the course of their careers but for those who are just starting up the ladder or those who will spend their lives doing the essential but less spectacular jobs in libraries we need a vehicle of recognition the school alumni newsletter says we your colleagues take note of your contribution to the profession finally whether anyone uses it or not the alumni newsletter is a mode of complaining venting frustrations suggesting or reacting to not the profession as a whole but the library school education which gave them a start in the profession every post secondary school the author has known has utilized some printed mode of communicating with its graduates however a search of library literature from  to the present and education index from i to the present yielded only one article addressing itself to any aspect of library school or any other type of alumni publications in the october  issue of the assistant librarian a british publication there appeared an article by m darvell entitled just look at them library school magazines unfortunately the article is not readily available but it is assumed from the punctuation that m darvell and the author have reached the same basic conclusions nine years

library school alumni publications prepared by someone at the school usually in the dean office three deans mail regular letters to all alumni but these have not been counted as alumni newsletters for the purposes of this survey since they do not include news of individual alumni and alumni association activities the university of toronto faculty of library science is unique in the sense that it issues four letters a year two each from the dean office and the alumni association a translation problem arises in reporting the answer to questions on frequency some schools say their publication is irregular when it is obvious from sample issues that they mean it appears twice a year but not always at the same time during the year others say irregular and mean they have published only two issues in the past five years the greatest number  have two issues a year six have three issues two are quarterly five are annual and nine report themselves to be irregular with no explanation to determine the total amount of information sent to alumni each year one must look not just at frequency but at printing style and number of pages a school which mimeographs  typewritten pages twice a year is not sending more words than a school which is using a composer or similar method and reducing  typed pages of information into a four page format twice a year of the schools which provided information about frequency and printing method there is the following breakdown  issue two newsletters a year of those six use some sort of composition or type size reduction method the average number of pages in this group is six per issue the nine remaining schools which either photocopy or mimeograph a typed format average ten pages per issue columbia has the largest press run with  copies of each issue simmons prints  and drexel  indiana pratt and toronto  denver  iowa  and the rest are  or less only  schools could provide budget figures so the following table summarizes size frequency and cost figures for those thirteen all schools use a bulk permit or third class mail except one which uses first class for its  copies once or twice a year some schools include the words address correction requested on their mailing label over half of the editors come from alumni volunteers and the rest are deans faculty or someone in the administrative offices of the library school some schools mention utilizing assistance from the placement alumni and public relations offices or faculty and students in two of the cases where the editor is an alumnus he is elected by the

library school alumni publications straints for volunteer editors it would seem that the university of toronty faculty of library science may have hit upon an excellent solution the administration of the school issues two newsletters a year with news of faculty courses programs and other subjects directly related to the school the alumni association also issues two newsletters a year dealing exclusively with alumni news and activities several criteria were used in evaluating the sample copies of library school alumni publications received as the result of simmons survey as mentioned earlier the contents cover a wide variety of subjects and with minor exceptions all of the subject content is worthy of inclusion however announcements of marriages births trips and other non professional activities should not be included this is purely a personal opinion brought on by the necessity for cutting down the volume of potential listings in the simmons librarian every issue those publications which were considered above average in content included articles or news items on such topics as grants to professors interviews with successful alumni profiles of new faculty members placement statistics results of alumni opinion polls and numerous other topics of interest and concern to alumni students and faculty the style demonstrated in library school alumni publications frequently showed the lack of a strong editor it is possible even essential to modify a writing style to fit the over all style of a publication without destroying the author tone or intent no article should be published exactly as received unless it is outstanding and contributors should be notified in advance that their articles may be cut corrected or reworded as librarians we should be appalled at the lack of reading skills possessed by graduates of the united states public education system the reading problem has as a side effect the result that even those who can read frequently cannot express themselves on paper even before assessing content the visual approach is often what prompts one to read or discard a publication is there an attractive masthead which identifies the name of the publication the responsible organization editor name frequency of publication date and volume number of this issue the masthead need not be elaborate in design or color but in some conspicuous spot it is essential that all of the above information be provided pictures don try to use them if youe using colored paper the result is less than satisfactory never use polaroid snapshots regardless of your budget and print method they do not reproduce clearly if your budget can support the use of color more power to you but
