the doctorate in librarianship and an assessment of graduate library education ray l carpenter and patricia a carpenter the demand for professional librarians in all capacities and the special demand for more highly educated and sophisticated personnel have led to reevaluation of library education programs the introduction of new goals and courses in established programs and the development of many newly accredited programs furthermore additional programs are being planned and discussed as a consequence of these developments there is an increased demand for library school faculty to man the new programs and a need for clarification of the present status of the several programs that is there are many unknowns in existing doctoral programs and several are examined here the following survey report is offered on the assumption that knowing more about the present graduates of the doctoral programs will provide more notions about the nature of our professional elite the doctorate in library science the study has two purposes to provide a description ray l carpenter is acting dean school of library science and research associate institute for research in social science university of north carolina at chapel hill he holds a doctorate in sociology and an ms in library science patricia also an ms in ls is presently a research assistant in ilnc nasa space sciences program special thanks go to the institute for research in social science for its assistance in data processing and analysis also to the smith fund university of north carolina for its financial assistance to kenneth shearer for his many helpful suggestions and to brenda roman for editorial assistance 
journal of education for librarianship of selected socio economic variables characterizing the present doctoral population and to provide a subjective evaluation of the library education programs by those people who are presumably the most knowledgeable people in the profession this second part of the study was inspired by the cartter study an assessment of quality in graduate education a comparative study of graduate departments in  academic disciplines which did not include librarianship as well as many other fields our modified counterpart of that study will be discussed later in this report hopefully this information will enable us to understand more precisely the problems involved in reducing the shortage of library science doctorates especially for teaching several basic questions were raised in the study reported below these include several background characteristics of library science doctorates  sex age marital status religion father occupation incidence of other librarians in the family birthplace residence institution where the degree had been granted job title whether or not the respondent was teaching library science or other courses fullor part time and both the present and the expected maximum annual salaries it was thought that certain of these characteristics would show some higher degree of incidence than might be expected for instance while about   per cent of librarians in general are female it seemed that this ratio might not be at all true of doctorates in other words it was hypothesized that measurement of certain factors  sex father occupation religion and whether or not other members of the family were librarians  would indicate that doctorates in library science were selectively recruited that they were not typical of a general cross section of the librarian population it is assumed of course that information about such variables can help to explain several important problems and can help to provide some basis for planning strategies in their solution given for instance that there are different sex ratios among the leaders in library science and among librarians in general we would ask if this implies a source of stress are women librarians under represented in the leadership are qualified doctoral women paid equitably are the members of this library elite from a representative socio economic background  or are they primarily from upper middle class protestant families the assumption underlying these questions is that leaders are more likely to be attuned to the needs of their public if they have participated in the same life experiences namely if they have similar socio economic life chances further a reasonably representative mixture of the 
doctorate in librarianship various class status categories should make for a richer interchange among leaders thereby modifying any tendency to adopt a single class outlook a second group of questions inquired about several standard issues in the field attitudes about the adequacy of librarianship its theory research and literature for a doctoral degree whether the phd dls or some other degree were preferred the relative importance of doctorates in other fields as teachers in schools of library science and the relative prestige thought to be enjoyed by a library science doctorate third were questions designed to draw out attitudes about teaching library science  factors in deciding where to teach including characteristics about the organization as well as the politicalracial climate etc finally as in the cartter study mentioned above respondents were asked to rank order the  doctoral programs for over all effectiveness and again for quality of the faculty they were then asked to describe on a scale of   don know to distinguished the  accredited library schools further in order to accommodate the fact that many library school programs are in a state of change respondents were given the opportunity to list names of schools whose doctoral or master programs they expected to decline or improve in the next   years the data base the three major sub sets of respondents consist of doctorates in library science deans of accredited library schools and a small sample of accredited library school faculty members each of these was selected on a basis most appropriate for its purpose an examination of dissertation abstracts and cohen library science dissertations    turned up a total of  earned doctorates in librarianship over  per cent of these names were eliminated  those who were deceased those who had been long in retirement and those who had returned to their native countries abroad a more realistic universe of doctorates as of the summer of  numbered  persons each was sent a questionnaire and  or  per cent were returned all deans of the then  accredited library schools were polled and a total of  responded among these were  with library science doctorates included in the  total above this was a period of considerable change of personnel among deanships however over  per cent 
journal of education for librarianship of those who were deans at that time and who had doctoral degrees in library science responded an additional  respondent deans had master degrees in library science or doctorates in other fields or both in order to provide some contrast or comparison at several points a random sample of  faculty members listed in the winter  issue of journal of education for librarianship excluding all deans and all persons holding doctorates in librarianship was queried fiftyfive of those queried returned the questionnaires much of the information following is based exclusively on the responses of the doctorates and deans while there were  deans who did not have library science doctorates it should be noted that inclusion of their responses with those of the library science doctorates does not materially bias the results reported here in the first place those deans without library science doctorates did not as a group vary in any important way from the deans as a whole and as a proportion of the total group of  their variation is negligible secondly a primary purpose of the study is to gain insights about the characteristics and attitudes of our professional elite and all deans clearly belong to this elite group whether or not they hold doctoral degrees in library science this is especially the case where we are concerned with evaluation of educational programs and of attitudes about teaching deans more than any other group are regularly concerned with the quantity and quality of doctoral production in order to best screen candidates for their faculties and to counsel students interested in doctoral study the added weight of the information they have far outweighs the minor problem of nominal difference from their colleagues due to lack of an earned library science degree as might be expected there are rather large numbers of respondents from a few schools and few respondents or none from several this is due to the great differentiation in numbers of graduates produced of course following is a short table showing the rate of response by school it should be noted that the percentages of those responding out of the total doctoral group are misleading in that they are too low notably of the number of doctorates awarded  were eliminated from polling as discussed earlier  due to death etc about  per cent of that number eliminated were graduates of the university of chicago the school with the largest number of graduates and with the longest history of doctoral education in effect the  responses from chicago

journal of education for librarianship these respects except for salary data which will be analyzed in detail in a later section sex and age table ii  age distribution by sex phds and deans female male row age phd deans total phd deans total total                                    over                 one female did not report age two results of the data obtained on sex and age are very prominent the sex ratio is approximately the opposite of that in the general population of library professionals and the majority of this group  is over  years old only one respondent a female did not report her age there are at least two reasons that may be offered to explain the age distribution first selection of librarianship as a career tends to come late in life second the low level of financial support leads to interrupted and prolonged study for the doctorate the relatively small proportion  of women might be accounted for by the assumption that women are less likely than men to make as total a career commitment as is demanded by doctoral study it should be noted also that women are slightly underrepresented among the respondents in that the universe of  doctorates is about  per cent female the universe of deans however does not have a higher proportion of women than our respondents deans expectedly are quite similarly distributed by sex but with a surprisingly high percentage  under  one important probable consequence of age should be noted there are very few young doctorates   per cent are over   and given the tendency for productivity to be greatest at   years of age there  the term phd and doctorate as used in this paper includes all doctorates in librarianship including the dls and a few edd degrees doctorate holders who earned their degrees in disciplines other than librarianship are not included 
doctorate in librarianship is probably a relatively low expectancy for research productivity among most present doctoral recipients librarianship especially library schools needs desperately to develop its research efforts and it would appear at this point that such developments must await extensive additions of appropriate personnel simply equipping and funding present staffs would not seem to be at all adequate for the needs marital status when we look at the variable of marital status for our subjects we find that there is a great difference between the sexes such a difference may explain in part the greater motivation of men to further their careers in order to provide more amply for their families the data on salaries shown later tends to bear this out table in  marital status by sex female male married   single   using frequencies chi square    df significant at  religion religious affiliation of interest for several reasons to behavioral scientists is somewhat problematic to assess is religious affiliation related to drive and achievement to professional status are the major religious groups widely represented among our library elite more than any other the question on religious affiliation raised the ire of respondents analysis of their comments leads one to conclude that many librarians assume that religion does not have any bearing on the profession or that it is not within the scope of science to inquire about one religious affiliation as a measure then the following figures must be used carefully fifty six per cent reported themselves as protestants  per cent as catholics  per cent as jews  per cent as none or other  and  per cent failed to report perhaps the best general source for comparison is greeley religion and career while our elite would seem to have about its proper share of protestants who are college graduates greeley data suggests that our catholic and jewish proportions are each too small by half additional research is required to analyze the religious composition of the profession at all levels we might well inquire of ourselves in the meantime as to the importance of this factor to the profession and to 
journal of education for librarianship the publics it serves closely related to the issue is ethnic background indeed ethnicity may  explain more than religious affiliation alone the differential distribution of religious groups among occupations further it should be noted that no inquiry about race was made of our subjects it is clear to the authors that the number of blacks among the doctoraldean group is negligible and that the need for black doctorates is probably as severe as any one sub set of the profession needs can be father occupation one of the most useful indicators of social class or socio economic status is the occupation of the respondent father the kind of class situation from which librarians come may of course affect their outlook perhaps even more important if we know that a severe shortage of personnel can be partly explained by lack of recruitment from a broad social spectrum we may take steps to recruit from social groups that may provide more manpower for as morrison concluded in his study of academic librarians  for a significant number of subjects the energy that enabled a person to break the social barriers to entrance into the profession also tended to carry him upward within it  father occupation phds deans total prof tech    farmer farm mgr    mgr official owner    skilled worker foreman    sales clerical    laborer service    deceased    retired    no response       table iv  father occupation phds and deans by percentage if we combine the figures for professional and technical occupations with those for managers officials and owners we see that these occupations account for  per cent of the total group of today doctorates father occupations these are occupations clearly education oriented and print oriented as a group persons in these occupations are reasonably affluent middle class and upper middle class with no doubt some 
doctorate in librarianship fully upper class members the results are generally similar to those in bryan the public librarian  of  years ago at that time professional librarians including those holding all types of degrees had fathers who were very much higher in the occupational hierarchy than the population average  per cent of the fathers were professional or managerial people and another  per cent were self employed the occupational background of doctorates fathers is quite similar to those sampled by centers his urban professionals had fathers who were largely business and professional people  but  per cent were in skilled manual jobs in the present study deans are more remarkably of a class than non deans in this respect since no one reported coming from bluecollar or even white collar working class family obviously it would not be expected that proportions of the deans and doctorates would be equally from each socio economic class if only because educational achievement in general tends to relate strongly to class with lower classes having far less education than others perhaps the most surprising finding is the very large percentage of librarians whose fathers were deceased or retired when the respondents became librarians this further attests to previous evidence of late career choice among librarians it also however suggests that there may have been some misunderstanding of the question inasmuch as respondents may have been describing their fathers present statuses if on the other hand so many do indeed come from homes where the mother was the sole parent for an important length of time it is tempting to hypothesize that maternal influence may be a large factor in selecting a career that is essentially female a career in which a male as an administrator or as a teacher may have control over women for the great majority of these subjects are male and a great majority of these males are administrators of libraries or library schools whose staffs and students are very largely female family members as librarians the mothers of only two respondents were librarians but  report that other members of the immediate family were librarians combining these figures then a total of  per cent of doctorates and deans have close family members who are librarians this percentage seems low in terms of the group itself but it is extraordinarily high when we consider it in terms of the total professional technical labor force that group in i consisted of  million persons mothers alone at our rate of  in  would account for  librarians family members for about  further the 
journal of education for librarianship rate of close family members as librarians is higher for men than for women again too much should not be made of limited data but the intriguing notion persists that role models in the family are very important to persons who have doctorates or who become deans in library science in particular the nature of the relationships between the sexes in the profession and the general female character of the profession may be closely related to the family of origin as well as to broader social forces and institutions birthplace  residence and mobility given that there are relatively few doctorates and deans to serve the library community is their geographic distribution reasonably equitable do members of this group tend to follow the widespread pattern of mobility among american professionals of finding employment in areas other than their birthplaces the following table includes data on deans and doctorates collectively as they do not differ on these variable relationships table v  birthplace and present residence birthplace totals present residence n e midwest south west canada for n  n e        midwest         south         west         canada                      chi square   sig at  level  df the northeast is the birthplace of nearly a quarter of our subjects but only  per cent of its natives remain there while  per cent move to the midwest and the remaining third are about evenly disposed to move to the south and the west the result is a net loss to the northeast where only  per cent of the group resides the midwest is both more productive of deans and doctorates in library science and more stable in holding them there it is the birthplace and the residence of over a third of the group nearly half of those born there remain there the south is clearly attractive to its natives  per cent remain in 
doctorate in librarianship the region of their birth further while it is the present home for about  per cent of our subjects only  per cent of the total group was born there there is too little data to present a very clear picture regarding our subjects of the western region not surprisingly more are presently residing there than were born there most of the natives do stay but they are equalled in number by those born in the south and in the northeast and they are outnumbered by those born in the midwest within regions certain states vary considerably as birthplaces and current residences fourteen doctorate respondents reside in texas while only five were born there iowa on the other hand was the birthplace of seven but no respondent holding a doctorate reported working in that state it should be noted that if texas were counted as a western rather than as a southern state the effect to which the south imports doctorates is much reduced and that of the west is increased since about  per cent of questionnaires sent to the northeast north central and south were returned to us and over  per cent of those sent to the west it may be assumed that this distribution of the respondents is representative preferences for living in the different parts of the united states as well as concern for race relations climate and community size are important factors for many people in deciding where they will work these factors will be discussed in a later section to provide partial explanation of this geographic distribution present positions held by doctorates one of the most important reasons for encouraging doctoral study is to develop larger and more qualified faculties for library schools as well as to provide more library administrators while it is difficult if even desirable to say what proportion of doctorates should become library educators the present proportion indicates that there is little reason for hoping that faculties in the near future will be upgraded by sizable additions of doctorates in librarianship of the  phds reporting their primary occupation not including deans of library schools  per cent are major executives  heads of a library system or major divisions of a library system or of a library  per cent are heads of smaller divisions of a library department heads  per cent are members of library school faculties and  per cent are employed as systems analysts academic deans and in similar peripheral or non library capacities when we consider that the total library science doctoral population is only about  it is apparent that the  accredited library schools 
journal of education for librarianship  could readily use all of them and still not satisfy the need for faculty that less than half of this small educated elite group of the profession is involved full time in library education documents the tremendous staffing problem cited so often by library school administrators it might be supposed that the situation is somewhat improved by the fact that some administrators also teach however only  per cent of the administrators teach either part time or in the summer such assistance is of course very valuable in itself  but it can hardly provide a strong basis for maintaining or upgrading professional school faculties the following three sections explain in more detail the relationships between positions held by doctorates and three previously described variables  sex father occupation and religion deans regardless of degree held are not included in these sections present position of phds related to sex relating the four major classes of present positions held by phds to the variable of the respondents sex shows some interesting patterns the positions of major executives and of faculty members accounting for  per cent of all doctorates are distributed as in the following table table vi  positions held by doctorates by sex position female male major executive   faculty member   n chi square   df   of those not shown in the table five are minor executives one is female and four are male of the seven employed in other capacities one is female six are male while  per cent of the men by this analysis are major executives only  per cent of the women are so employed men clearly either seek or are favored more than women for top positions in administration findings in this survey in regard to women doctorates tended to follow those reported by guy marco in  for he too found it    interesting to note that women graduates have been more likely to go into library school teaching than into administration  present position of phds related to father occupation apart from those whose fathers were deceased or retired head librarians are

journal of education for librarianship respondents produced a group which was  per cent female and  per cent male and one half of whom were between the ages of  and  this appears to differ sharply with the group of doctoral respondents who were primarily male and over  seventy seven per cent of the faculty group reported their religious affiliation as protestant and  per cent as catholic with none reporting as jewish and  per cent reporting other or no religious affiliation as with the doctoral respondents  per cent failed to answer the question concerning religious preference the fathers of  per cent belonged to the professional or technical occupational group and the next highest occupational grouping  was that of managers officials and owners as occurred in the responses from the doctoral group a high percentage  indicated that their fathers were deceased or retired when they entered librarianship four per cent of the sample reported that close family members were librarians of the  respondents  hold doctoral degrees in fields other than library science  hold master degrees and  hold bachelor degrees salaries one of the most prominent rewards for investing in advanced education is increased income the various ways in which this proposition properly describes the reality of doctorates and deans is presented in this section in addition to the salaries of the group as a whole a large number of contingencies are presented to facilitate our understanding of several variations within the group based on sex region and other variables these measures may help to explain the dynamics of the distribution of doctoral degree holders the rationale for the geographical mobility of our subjects the distinction made between the sexes for different occupational roles and over all the appeal held out for doctoral study in terms of income salary by age and sex doctorates only this breakdown of salary by age and sex is quite revealing the difference in median salaries for men and women ranges from nearly  per cent for the   year group to over  per cent for the   year olds the small number of women involved notwithstanding it is clear that men are not only paid far better at each age level but also that they are much more numerous than women in groups which are receiving the highest salaries in addition nearly a third of the

journal of education for librarianship attitudes towards selected characteristics of education for librarianship this section analyzes attitudes or opinions about several issues much discussed in library education these include questions about the substance of librarianship  its adequacy for the doctorate the type of degree most appropriate dls or similar vs phd the employment of persons with doctorates in other fields in library schools the prestige thought to be held by non librarians by a library science doctorate in comparison with other doctoral degrees and the comparison by the respondent of his doctorate in librarianship with doctorates in other disciplines in addition data on expected maximum salaries are offered as an indication of the possible ultimate financial rewards of the doctorate type of degree of the  doctorates and deans responding to this question  per cent indicated that the phd is the most appropriate degree for the doctorate in librarianship eleven per cent support the dls and  per cent feel that either or both would be appropriate the rather long standing argument about this problem has taken much time and energy on the part of educators the problem and issues involved are quite complicated but the consensus of this large and most knowledgeable group is quite clear the additional few who offered comments on the topic indicated that the dls is more appropriate for administration the phd for research and that both have a proper role in the profession this logical distinction seems however not to be widely shared and the percentages cited above hold for deans and for doctorates grouped separately as well as collectively substantiality of librarianship fairly sharp differences between doctorates and deans and between doctoral faculty and major executives were expressed in their feelings about the substance of librarianship table xxi  substance of librarianship for the phd doctorates deans total n n n faculty executives total inadequate      adequate      more than adequate

journal of education for librarianship large increases in academic salaries during the past ten years this may not be a realistic expectation being unduly conservative however the majority of our respondents are relatively old  they may well feel that they are near the peak of their earning powers in spite of potential general salary increases in education in any event the percentage increase does indicate that there is considerable confidence in gaining more income a truly pessimistic group might well anticipate smaller increase or no change at all or possibly even a reduction a common psychological notion put simply says that people with a sanguine outlook tend to have better outcomes the following table is a rough measure of this relationship with present salary as an indicator of outcome and one own felt prestige an indicator of optimism expected salary may be considered a measure too of optimism  in terms of outcome data for deans and doctorates are not presented separately as they tend to vary in the same way that is although deans earn more on the average than other doctorates and feel more sanguine about the doctorate their salaries are directly related to their attitudes towards the doctorate  ie in the same way as the doctorates table xxv  median present and expected salaries and evaluation of the library science doctorate self prestige present salary expected salarynear the top    in the middle   near the bottom      the two surprising findings are that those who feel that the library science doctorate is near the bottom of the scale of prestige for doctorates in general earn more money than those in either of the other groups and that the median expected salary is highest for those who feel most conservative about the prestige of the doctorate  that it is in the middle of the prestige range the prestige which one feels one enjoys may be indicative of traits important to the development of the profession and to inculcating professional world view to students in general a sense of prestige would seem to relate closely and positively to self confidence as well as to confidence in the profession itself to cope with the problems and goals before it other measures than those in the foregoing table are necessary to assess this to be sure while it might be argued that 
doctorate in librarianship women are more self confident than men among librarians about whom so much has been said about their lack of self confidence it is probable that women are not so unrealistic as to fail to perceive at all the relative status of librarianship doctorates within the total range of doctorates the question is essentially whether or not their primary reference group is more selective as described earlier than that of men non librarians teaching in library schools from table xxvi it may be argued that the professional elite largely welcomes the participation of other disciplines in professional education over  per cent of the deans would employ outsiders to the extent of one half or more of their faculty strength the doctoral faculty and executives would not be so generous but only a quarter of them would eliminate the use of non librarians or reduce them to a definite minority table xxvi  attitude towards employment of non librarians in library education should earned doctorates in other fields be employed in doctorates deans library schools n n total primarily    about one half    in strength    definite minority    notatali       it might be expected that those who felt strongest about excluding doctorates in other fields also would feel that the relative prestige of the doctorate is high table xxvii would support this expectation if we accept the very small marginal cells but in the main it seems that over  per cent of those who vary in allowing as high a proportion of non librarians as one half of the faculty to those who would keep them to a definite minority feel that the library science doctoral degree is near the bottom  in the prestige scale faculty random sample attitudes a rather startling difference was noted between the doctoral respondents and the faculty group in regard to the type of degree most appropriate to the doctorate in library science eighty six per cent of those holding library science

journal of education for librarianship are the status of women and the status of research in the profession women constitute the large majority of the general population of librarians but a small minority of the doctorates is it not possible that librarianship can take steps to guarantee equitable salaries and opportunities for promotion in order to encourage more women from its own population to obtain the doctorate  this may be a far more successful strategy than appealing to men outside the profession and it has the independent and very important advantage of enhancing the sense of distributive justice in the profession which is sorely strained because of sex linked inequities real and imagined the development of research will hardly solve all other problems but it can go a long way towards solving at least two of the large classes of problems in the profession research based on and contributing both to library science concepts and theories and to those in related disciplines can gradually build a body of data and theory that will serve as a sound intellectual foundation only by building such a foundation will the profession move from its auxiliary status to one that clearly contributes to the general body of knowledge in our civilization in so strengthening its status librarianship can also solve some of its practical problems that is research in librarianship may attack the vast area of information theory for instance and while contributing to the understanding of information production and transfer in a universal sense may also discover principles for better planning and organizing the information functions peculiar to librarianship that the present library science doctorates are generally ready for some such development is demonstrable in their overwhelming preference for the phd presumably a research degree in their relatively secure feeling about the adequacy of the field for doctoral study and in the importance they assign to research as a factor in selecting employment while one might wish that their feelings were even more positively oriented towards research given the relatively short history of research in the field as compared with other disciplines  the stress on administration which so many respondents must work with daily and the very limited research facilities presently available to librarians the attitudes of the doctorates are certainly positive enough to support development of this crucial function assessment of graduate library education programs at the time of the survey there were ten doctoral and  ala accredited primarily master programs in the united states and 
doctorate in librarianship canada some of these programs have been active for many years others are very new some have large student bodies some are small there are great variations in many other respects including emphasis on the type of library that students are prepared for the size of the faculty and the qualifications and interests of its members and the resources available to students and faculty consequently it is assumed that these variations result in widely different reputations or prestige how well known are these several schools to the library profession and what are their reputations we assumed that doctorates in library science and deans of the accredited schools are the most sensitive and knowledgeable about the relative merits of these schools for these are the men and women of the profession who have invested most in their professional education who have wide ranging contacts with graduates of many schools and whose work makes it important that they be aware of the quality of the schools additionally these very respondents feel that a school reputation is so important that they rated it as their first consideration in accepting a position more often than any other factor table xv hence it was assumed that they would have formed relatively objective judgments about the various programs in  an assessment of quality in graduate education  by allan m cartter was published under the aegis of the american council on education our analysis of library education programs refers often to this study and is intentionally modelled in part on it the cartter study analyzed the graduate programs in basic academic fields among the professions only engineering was included in over  institutions of higher education for each discipline half of these institutions are rated as extremely attractive attractive or acceptable plus depending on the rating given to each by a national sample of graduate faculty in the field our study employs different labels to reach the same goal ordinal ranking of schools on the basis of their programs and of their faculties as judged by the doctorates and deans in librarianship doctoral programs the questionnaire asked that each of the  doctoral programs then active be ranked first through tenth on two different dimensions  the over all effectiveness of the program and the quality of the faculty these responses were tallied and are presented in the tables following the ratings were then compared with the results of the cartter study to determine to some extent the influence of a school reputation in other fields on its library school rating of particular interest is the fact that although  per cent of the 
journal of education for librarianship doctorates and deans responding considered school reputation a vital consideration in deciding where to teach only  per cent of the respondents rated the doctoral programs on their over all effectiveness and an even lesser proportion  rated them on the quality of their faculties table xxviii  doctoral program effectiveness  ranking of programs receiving  or more of votes for each of first three ranks doctorates and deans n faculty random sample st nd rd x st nd rd x chicago         illinois         rutgers         columbia         michigan         berkeley     all others                 chicago received the largest proportion of votes for first place by a rather large margin however when the votes for the first three ranks are combined its rank and that of illinois are very close rutgers columbia and michigan constitute a cluster considerably below the first two choices and all other schools combined received relatively few votes for these top three ranks the faculty random sample shows some variation from the distribution of the deans and doctorates votes the primary difference is that columbia emerges strongly as first place choice and narrowly exceeds chicago in votes for the first three places further the first place votes for case were second in number only to those for columbia and account for the  per cent in the all others row the average vote for case however for the first three positions is only eight per cent columbia and case are clearly held in higher esteem by these respondents than by the elite group in the following table the assessment of the quality of faculty columbia position is enhanced considerably when the votes for the top three ranks are combined although chicago again is unquestionably the raters first choice the response by the random faculty sample 
doctorate in librarianship was too small to report in detail chicago placed first and columbia a very close second while the over all difference in ranking of the schools on the two dimensions over all effectiveness and quality of faculty is not great it should be noted that columbia position is somewhat enhanced and case position is greatly enhanced by the respective ratings of their faculties table xxix  quality of faculty ranking of programs receiving  or more of votes for each of first three ranks doctorates and deans n st nd rd x chicago     illinois     columbia     rutgers     berkeley     michigan     case     all others         effect of institutional loyalty about one half of the respondents place their alma mater ahead of all other institutions and another  per cent rank their own schools second one major consequence of course is that schools with few or no alumni among the respondents might be rated too low however it turns out that if among doctorates and deans all first place votes for the respondent alma mater are eliminated the rank order of the schools would change only in that berkeley would move up to a tied third place with columbia and rutgers would move to fifth place  for over all effectiveness no change would occur in the ranking of the schools by the faculty random sample when preferences for respondent institution are eliminated there is strong question on our part about the interpretation of such an analysis the fact that alumni quite frequently boost their alma maters should not leave us with the conclusion that loyalty and actual quality or effectiveness are mutually exclusive or antagonistic indeed one might well rank his school first or second on strong non subjective assumptions 
journal of education for librarianship doctoral program improvement and decline library education programs change as do other programs the introduction of new curricula or new faculty for instance may not be presently assessable but raters may have some sense of impending change for better or worse in the several programs in order to gauge these expectations about the programs respondents were asked to list schools that they expect to improve or to decline in the next five to ten years by and large doctorate holders deans and the faculty random sample agreed on the probable future status of the doctoral programs of the schools that were expected to improve berkeley and indiana received the most votes  each  pittsburgh and michigan were also frequently cited case western reserve and southern california are expected to make some modest improvement and columbia illinois and rutgers are seen making relatively little net change the university of chicago was the one school to receive more likely to decline  than likely to improve votes from the total of  respondents who listed it the only bias possibly introduced by alumni or employee votes is in the case of michigan if such votes were eliminated michigan future status would seem to be as likely to decline as it would be to improve several recent doctoral programs were voted as likely to improve most prominent among these was maryland new program which was singled out as highly favored for future development by  deans and doctorates programs at florida state wisconsin and ucla were also mentioned as being of future promise comparison of doctoral ratings in library science with ratings in other disciplines there are many advantages for a library education program that is located in an institution with strong departments in other disciplines library schools can and do profit by using courses offered by other departments to supplement their own curricula the importance of this strategem for computer and information science instruction is particularly great it is also probable that superior faculty and students will be attracted to superior institutions programs in library science are in institutions of widely varying quality in other disciplines table xxx ranks the ten doctoral programs in librarianship in each of eight other disciplines that represent the humanities social sciences and the sciences these ranks are based on the cartter study of graduate education berkeley stands at the top in all eight fields and chicago contends for a close second place michigan columbia and illinois are not only ranked high in all fields but

doctorate in librarianship to be indeed if the elite of the profession its doctorates and deans are so in the dark about so many programs what can be expected of the general population of librarians  or the population at large in academic life from which the profession recruits sixteen schools were rated don know by  per cent or more of the faculty random sample geography may explain some portion of this factor three of the schools with high unknown ratings are canadian and the others are relatively new or isolated the less than adequate rating appeared with surprising frequency and it often appeared in highest proportion for schools that also received many do not know responses responses by doctorates and deans were very similar to those of the faculty random sample eight us schools were rated by   per cent of their total votes as less than adequate and by   per cent as do not know none of the three canadian schools although highly unknown were ranked less than adequate by more than six per cent of the respondents another six us schools were considered less than adequate by   per cent of their raters this number of accredited schools rated so low constitutes a high proportion of the total and suggests a serious problem for the profession relationship to other disciplines table xxxra  rank order by eight fields of institutions offering master and new doctoral programs in library science at least four departments rated extremely wisconsin attractive or attractive minnesota ucla washington north carolina at least four departments rated acceptable texas plus or higher but fewer than four extremely oregon attractive or attractive syracuse maryland one to three departments rated acceptable emory plus no departments rated higher florida louisiana wayne  the ten on going doctoral programs similarly analyzed earlier are not included in this table the eight disciplines include english history political science sociology chemistry bacteriology microbiology electrical engineering and mechanical engineering as rated in the cartter study 
journal of education for librarianship in addition to the ten schools with doctoral programs only  of the possible  schools with accredited master programs managed to attain some mention for quality in the cartter study only nine or about  per cent of the schools in addition to the ten schools with on going doctoral programs are in a very strong position for support from these eight other disciplines several of the schools rated highest in other disciplines are planning or have recently begun doctoral programs and some of them enjoy ratings of other departments superior to those in some of the existing doctoral programs conclusion by the judgments of our elite respondents the merits of accredited library schools are greatly varied accreditation as a measure even of minimal quality is clearly questionable in the eyes of our judges and we suspect in the eyes also of the thoughtful among professional librarians in general the growing emphasis on the quality of library school students adds to the dilemma no one wants to recommend a promising student to an inadequate or marginally acceptable school accredited or not accreditation procedures might be improved but at best accreditation is probably only useful as an incentive and safeguard for some very basic level of satisfactoriness the major problem lies not in accreditation per se but in the lack of resources to insure the maintenance of high quality programs and personnel several of the ideas for improving library school programs offered in the first section of this paper rest ultimately for their successful implementation on improved funding for nearly all basic activities in library education programs particularly research and personnel funding of a much higher order for new and imaginative research operations for qualified instructors librarians and non librarians for attracting superior students is highly important providing programs especially for the doctorate that will allow the student to progress steadily and quickly is of great importance for new programs and for older programs that have lost their focus and organizational efficiency the programs on any level like the students must be appropriate for the goals recruiting students and developing programs that are mutually suited and that suit the ever greater demands for sophistication in research and practice comprise an enormous undertaking for the profession guidance and assistance must be obtained from many sources outside the profession but it is clear that many of our problems are internal and will require much further and repeated attention
