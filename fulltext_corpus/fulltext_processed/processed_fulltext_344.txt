machine animisai in modern children literature h joseph schwarcz inanimate objects as protagonists hans christian andersen titerature of all times and of all peoples has always known and  told of man made objects that took on a magic quality and served their owners in miraculous ways but inanimate objects as protagonists of tales can be found before the latter half of the nineteenth century only very rarely in order to be the hero of a tale the object has to undergo a process of animation it is shaped by technological processes so as to be useful to man is perceived as an entity and is endowed with life the leap fantasy has to take is much greater than in the anthropomorphization of talking beasts a few examples can be adduced the old caucasian the term being used in its geographical not its racial sense motif of the kitchen utensils rebellion against man tells of excited pots and pans etc that will not stand their servitude any more but the good housewife finds a way to pacify them in one version of the pot a danish folk tale the story hero is a pot that wanders from one home to another in the village and endeavors to bring food to the poor the pot speaks and replies when spoken to it shows understanding yet its owner received it from the hands of a good witch and it is at her command that he has taken up the task of going from door to door looking for the deserving poor in another version of the same tale it is in a poor man possession and skips to more fortunate homes and farms and steals food grain and money for its owner it talks and acts independently and responds to questions it was given to its owner by a fine faced stranger the tale bears social significance it is a kind of robin hood pot but of definitely magical origin in goethe wandering bell the church bell leaves its steeple and harasses the child who refuses to come to church for sunday prayers yet the child has been forewarned by his mother that this might finally happen the bell therefore appears to have been sent by some higher power the common characteristics of the objects in the tales cited seem to be that though personified they appear in stories that are actually parables and that man superiority is not questioned and as has been mentioned the examples are relatively rare all this was changed by the appearance of the first writer of modern fantasy hans christian andersen his unusually sensitive mind discovered life in everyone and everything whatever his fantasy touched upon became for him the bearer of a destiny the lder topf danemark eutropdische volksmarchen ausgewalt von max luthy zurich manesse bibliothek der weltliteratur   pp    the talking pot thirteen danish tales retold by mary c hatch new york harcourt brace  co  pp   johann wolfgang goethe die wandlende glocke goethe gedichte berlin verlag der literaturwerke minerva nd p

 the library quarterly children literature is one of the means by which children are socialized and are acquainted with important aspects and features of their civilizations it is therefore only natural that gadgets and machines should loom prominently in children books in an era and a society that is in fact based on technological development some of the essential attributes of machinery its colorfulness its acoustic quality and its usually locomotive character make it especially attractive to children the many stories and poems in which inanimate machinery plays an important role have the additional task of catering to the child daydreams and serve the goal of wish fulfilment in fantasy while the child who dreams of operating machines cannot yet do so in reality he can do so in fantasy at the same time machinery in stories as in his play aids him in overcoming fears of the powerful contraption that he harbors in his mind a good example is the story about johnny machines where the little boy tells his grandfather that he likes to push buttons so grandfather brings in more and more machines and the farm becomes mechanized while johnny and grandfather are continually proud of and fascinated by the mysterious things it was all because johnny likes to push buttons another example would be smoky and the red fire engine a stray dog who is fascinated by the red fire engine one day succeeds in riding on it to be present at a fire where he saves a girl doll by this act he gains a home for himself the machine important role is brought out well but people and dogs are even more important in these stories machines are presented to the child as interesting and intriguing yet they are mechanical creations of man ingenuity and nothing else adults or children are the stories actors and heroes with the appearance of the anthropomorphic machine in children literature however this is changed decisively they the machines are animated they usually have names and have the ability to think and even more so to relate emotionally to others like themselves and to animals and human beings they become co protagonists or sole protagonists of the story the child is expected this is what the story proposes to him to enter into a meaningful emotional fantasy relation to it him her exactly as he would be expected to do in a story about a human being or an animal in other words he is asked to identify with the machine hero exploits and personality it is assumed that he will learn from them and that these stories will advantageously influence the development of his personality the fact that unlike humans and animals and in fantasy at least effigies dolls and toys machines have actually only a strictly functional raison dtrethis fact is neglected within the confines of the story that humanizes machines several more or less distinct types can be recognized the distinction appears to be created mainly by the two criteria of the degree of intensity with which personification is carried out and the degree of meaningfulness inherent in the machtne as protagonist in general the two criteria can be said to be interdependent variables the more important the machine helen palmer johnny machines in ellen l buell a treasury of little golden books new york golden press  pp    joseph demers smoky and the red fire engine in arthur i gates miriam b huber and frank s salisbury friends and fun new york macmillan co  pp
