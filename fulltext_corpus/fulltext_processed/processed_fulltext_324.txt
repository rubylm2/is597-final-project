german working class reading and the rise of naziism heinz schurer in i just before the outbreak of world war ii dr erich thier director of the leipzig library school deutsche volksbiichereischule published a study of the reading habits of the workers of leipzig using for the most part data from the period of the democratic weimar republic ii  the study was published at a time when hitler dictatorship over germany seemed to be firmly established the whole book is written in an enthusiastic nazi spirit and the author characteristically goes out of his way to preface it with a quotation from a speech by hitler naturally the question arises as to whether a book written in nazi germany at such a time and under such conditions deserves any serious notice at all or whether it should be dismissed as mere nazi propaganda careful study of the work however leads to the conclusion that its contents should be of interest to librarians and to sociologists and it is hoped that the present discussion of thier material may stimulate further and more ambitious research along the same lines thier book is based on the analysis of documentary evidence collected in the leipzig public libraries where a method of making such investigations had been developed by one of the foremost figures of german librarianship walter hofmann under hofmann guidance the leipzig public libraries had become model institutions of their kind of which the community was immensely and rightly proud and which were much studied and admired all over germany among the special features of the library technique developed in leipzig was a method of issuing books to readers which made it possible to study the reading habits of individual readers or groups of readers over long periods a leseheft reading record was issued to every user of the library details of the reader occupation and age were noted on each leseheft and a record was kept on it of all books withdrawn by him these lesehefte when collected furnished a basis for detailed investigations of reading habits the pioneer work of this kind was carried out by walter hofmann himself in his remarkable analysis of the reading of women thier study is a successor volume to hofmann pioneer achievement naturally an analysis from the pen of an ardent nazi librarian of the reading of working class readers during the period preceding the establishment of the hitler regime presents problems of a very special kind and this perforce leads us to a political digression while the traditional influence of socialist and marxist ideology on the german working class is a matter of common knowledge at this very moment we are witnessing the revival of the socialist and marxist working class movement in germany after the downfall of hitler the special position of leipzig in the history of the german labor movement is not so well known throughout its history the leipzig x gestaltwandel des arbeiters im spiegel seiner lektiire ein beitrag zur volkskunde und leserfihrung beitrage zur volksbiichereikunde hrsg von der reichsstelle fur das volksbiichereiwesen bd i leipzig otto harrassowitz   die lektiire der frau leipzig i 
 the library quarterly working class has been regarded as one of the best educated most intelligent politically mature advanced sections of the german working class it was in leipzig that ferdinand lassalle founded the first socialist workers party in germany in i and in the days of bismarck that statesman great socialist antagonists august bebel and wilhelm liebknecht had leipzig as their headquarters in world war i the leipzig workers had solidly backed the pacifist wing of the socialist party which was strongly opposed to kaiser wilhelm war policy during the period of the weimar republic the leipzig working class was extremely well organized politically as well as industrially and the leipzig socialists formed one of the most highly valued sections of the german social democratic party further for centuries leipzig had been the center of the german book trade and one of the centers of german publishing there was a large group of highly skilled workers engaged in the printing and binding of books and allied trades and the connection between the world of books and large numbers of the working class at least from the point of view of mere physical contact was far closer than would normally be the case seen against this background it is evident that a study of the reading habits of the leipzig workers was a task worth undertaking to introduce the author dr erich thier came from a working class background himself and started life as a manual worker by taking advantage of the adult education facilities granted to able youths of his class in the days of the weimar republic he managed to get a university as well as a library training and rose to become director of one of the largest of the leipzig public libraries situated in the heart of an extensive working class district in politics he was connected with the socialist movement and was active in adult educational work carried out under socialist auspices for many years then came the slump of i and on its heels the meteoric rise of the nazi party culminating in its triumph in  like his chief and inspirer walter hofmann erich thier was swayed by the surge of the nazi movement even before it had come into political power and by the time his book was written the former socialist had long been an active nazi in short with a personal history like this thier was well qualified to investigate the reading habits of the leipzig workers with whom he had been in close contact throughout his life on the other hand readers of his book must beware of the political bias which pervades it if however some of the data set forth by thier prove useful for a better understanding of the sociological aspects of group reading then even the nazi book will have rendered some service to the cause of social science and true scholarship despite the fact that it was written to buttress a cause which stood for just the opposite before discussing thier data and the conclusions he bases on them two points must be mentioned which should be borne in mind in any discussion of the leipzig public libraries first practically all german public libraries deny open access to the shelves to their readers and thus there is a fundamental difference between them and american and english public libraries second walter hofmann was never interested in the number of people who became readers in his libraries or in circulation statistics he was a protagonist of the strictest possible principles of book selection and much preferred a small number of readers reading good books to a huge mass of read
german working class reading and the rise of naziism  ers reading a huge mass of indifferent books beanrng these differences in mind one is not surprised to find that the extent of library membership revealed by the leipzig library statistics is extremely low as compared with american and british figures thier investigation is limited for the most part to the adult male workers who were active readers for the ten year period i  during the years i  adult male worker readers in the leipzig public libraries numbered only two to three thousand in i  the years of the slump and its consequent mass unemployment the membership figures of this particular social group rose steeply until they reached ten thousand at the end of the period with the decrease in unemployment which coincided with the establishment of the nazi regime in i there was a strong downward trend to about seven thousand in  p i the most detailed figures are available for  according to the german national census held in june of that year leipzig then had i inhabitants of these i used the leipzig public libraries of these users  per cent belonged to the working class the group with which we are concerned the adult male worker readers numbered  since there were i  adult male workers in leipzig this means that only about  per cent of them were users of the public libraries a figure which corroborates one expectations as to the probable low percentage of library readers in relation to the whole leipzig population bearing in mind the rather austere aspects of the leipzig public libraries no admission of light books no open access the answer to the question with which thier opens his investigation becomes evident what section of the working class is likely to join the public libraries thier answers and there seems to be no reason to disagree the more intelligent and the skilled worker is the first to become a reader p  while a general statement of that sort occasions no surprise the figures thier gives concerning the proportions of skilled and unskilled workers are truly interesting according to a very elaborate occupational analysis in  this proportion was as high as  to i p is on the whole one seems to be justified in assuming that the small minority of adult male workers who were regular readers in the leipzig public libraries for a period of ten years and longer represent the intellectual upper layer of their class thier uses two periods of comparison the first covering the years i  and the second the years   most of his statements are based on the results yielded by an investigation of the first period again a historical digression is necessary to sketch the respective social and political atmospheres of these two periods although during the first period there is one year i of acute political social and economic crisis the other years especially i  are on the whole characterized by a certain stability dawes agreement locarno and there is no violent challenge to the republican form of government which was fervently supported by the majority of german socialist workers the second period    is characterized by an appalling economic slump huge mass unemployment and the rapidly increasing menace of the nazi movement which from the very smallest beginnings suddenly rose to become a huge party with a following of millions a comparison of the two periods so unlike in their characteristics shows considerable  page references throughout are to thier book
 the library quarterly variations in the reading habits of the group of workers and thier investigation produces some very interesting and illuminating results the period i  comparison of working class and middle class readers thier divides the whole field of nonfiction into three groups i literature in which the main feature is the appeal to the imagination  literature appealing table  working class middle class readers readers imaginative i o practical  i oo oi theoretical   based on thier table  p  table j type of nonfiction working class middle class type o nonfction readers readers travel i  war memoirs i ioo animal life   i   based on thier table  p  to the practical mind and  literature appealing to the theoretical mind the figures concerning the proportionate interest in these three groups of nonfiction taken by working class as compared with middle class readers are revealing table i compared with all the other groups of male readers the working class readers form the group with the smallest share of theoretical interest p  the picture given by the proportions in table i is corroborated by further data which seem worth reproducing table  the proportion is at once reversed if different types of books are chosen but the resulting psychological picture remains the same table  these comparative figures appear valuable enough while it would be rash to draw too many conclusions as to the inherent inferiority of the one and the inherent superiority of the other class from the data the unequal distribution of psychological types and intellectual ability in the two classes compared comes out very clearly there is no reason to suppose that the middle class readers represent an elite of their class while there is some basis for assuming that this is the case with the working class readers which makes the striking differences retable  workingmiddletype of nonfiction class class readers readers music arts literature  oo i ancient greece and rome  i plays poetry   oo i theoretical natural sciences i i  based on thier table s p i s vealed still more remarkable in the light of thier figures the profound psychological buttressing of social class divisions appears to be a phenomenon of considerable significance and the facts revealed by the analysis at this stage alone seem to justify the method as developed in leipzig as a useful tool of social investigation fields of interest of workingclass readers thier devotes a considerable amount of space to the study of several special types of readers who are clearly marked off from the rest the data used are based on an analysis of a thousand lesekefte all belonging to the group of adult male worker readers
german working class reading and the rise of naziism  theory minded readersthe group of readers interested above the average in problems of theory was found to be extremely small amounting to only i of the ioo only  of the io borrowed more than  theory books in two years thier comments on these results as follows when talking about the theoretically gifted and interested worker we can never for a minute compare his reading quota with the usual book consumption of the intellectual worker we have also to bear in mind what an impact each single theoretical work if mastered is bound to have on the worker reader such a book in its relative value or lack of value is not considered as it should be against the background of the entire scientific knowledge of which it forms only a part a single unit among possibly hundreds and hundreds of books compared with the reading of the intellectual worker the self education of the worker reader must bear a dogmatic character  only a very few worker readers give the impression that they are really members of the intelligentsia and have been born into the wrong class  the majority master only a few works belonging to the sphere of true learning pp   technically minded readersthe readers interested in technology a very sharply defined group muster only twice as many as the theory minded  out of iooo thier comments on the mentality of this group are to the effect that they are the most unambitious in their general reading this applies also to their reading of fiction not a few of them he says are so devoted to their special line that to them any other aspects of life are almost negligible readers of travel and adventurethe group of readers of travel and adventure is as large as that of the technically minded about  these two groups together are four times as large as that of the theory minded as thier has it this class of readers is the most uncomplicated or the most primitive if you like of working class readers politically minded readersin the imagination of the average member of the leipzig middle classes the typical leipzig worker was a man obsessed by political fanaticism absolutely enmeshed in marxist philosophy full of class resentment blind to everything in life but politics viewed from the narrowest angle of socialist militancy and filled with a burning hatred of the capitalist system this conception was characteristic of the political outlook of the german and austrian middle classes and has had a disastrous influence on german politics during the period between the two wars therefore it is worth discussing however fantastically it misrepresented the true state of german working class psychology after all not only the leipzig worker but the working class throughout germany has always been supposed to be profoundly influenced by orthodox marxist ideology to what extent did this political philosophy influence the reading of that section of our readers which is clearly marked off from the rest as specially interested in politics we can safely assume that this section would solidly vote socialist or communist in elections and many of the group would be active in the political labor movement or in the trade unions first as to the actual size of the section contrary to all expectations the politically minded group comprises only  of the iooo worker readers thus it is by far the smallest special group further the definitely marxist readers among them comprise just half of the group that is there are  intensely marxist readers among the i oo marx das kapital quoted daily in both the left wing and the right wing press as the bible of the german worker was issued only  times in five years p  while
 the library quarterly other more easily accessible marxist classics were more popular there still remains the astonishing fact that the worker readers were very little attracted to the marxism which was generally supposed to be in germany the one and only subject in which they were interested this lack of interest was the more remarkable because the socialist literature was extremely well represented in the leipzig public libraries an excellent guidebook to this field compiled by herr erich thier was available for a few cents to any interested reader a similar picture is shown by an analysis of the interest of worker readers in the social sciences the social sciences were very little read thier shows not only travel books but technology natural sciences history literature music and fine arts were read more extensively the social sciences as well as the novel of social criticism were read more by the middleclass readers than by the working class readers even to one intimately acquainted with the leipzig working class of the period discussed by thier the data he gives come as a surprise that the analysis does reveal such an unexpected state of affairs seems to me to be a very important reason for undertaking such investigations to many people the laborious social surveys undertaken by investigators seem a sheer waste of time since the results obtained are often so obvious that the amount of work connected with the survey appears to be grotesquely incommensurate wvith the results i myself have heard a lecturer in a british school of librarianship making fun of the statistical surveys of reading habits which after months of counting punched cards reveal only that women over thirty five like to read love stories it is perfectly true that the readers survey often merely corroborates impressions which come to the average educated person by the ordinary experiences of life but on the other hand as we have seen it does reveal facts completely at variance with empirical conceptions based on common sense and ordinary experience and does give a quantitative basis for such generalizations literature minded readersthe last special group includes those readers who are predominantly interested in literature the theater music and the arts this group numbered  out of i and is thus smaller than either the technically minded group or the group of readers of travel and adventure but twice as large as the politically minded group thier offers the following comments the working class reader chooses fiction and belles lettres mostly according to their contents he asks for a social novel an adventure story a historical yarn but not for the most recent work or a definite work by a definite author it takes a very long time for the current literary fashion to be perceived by the working class reader in most cases by the time this fashion reaches him it has already become out of date for the middle class reader even then names of authors mean little every librarian knows the request slips in which only the book titles are entered but not the names of the authors here thier analysis is borne out by other investigators of the sociology of reading there seems to be a definite law of time lag according to which currents of thought and artistic expression take a considerable time to percolate down into the various social classes from the culturally creative strata of society attention to this time lag as a characteristic feature of culture distribution has been drawn in one of the most brilliant essays on the social aspects of reading
german working class reading and the rise of naziism  mrs q  leavis fiction and the reading publico thier gives another interesting example this time taken from history it seems to take a number of years for historical events to be digested sufficiently to become subjects on which interest becomes concentrated the russian revolution of  did not interest the leipzig working class readers so much during the period   as did the french revolution of  p  to recapitulate of iooo readers who generally speaking can be regarded as the cream of the leipzig working class i were especially interested in particular fields of these  were interested in higher level fields theory minded i politically minded  literatureminded iso and  in lower level fields technically minded  readers of travel and adventure  the one field which is conspicuously mssing as a field of special interest is religion leipzig like the whole of saxony is a predominately lutheran town in a roman catholic district it is very likely that another picture would have been encountered if socialism in its german materialist form inspired only a minority of the worker readers to take a deeper interest in politics and an even smaller number to take an interest in marxism it certainly acted as an agent for diverting the reader interest from religion in this respect an analogous study of the reading of british workers would probably reveal a different state of affairs as the picture stands in an lite of working class readers as few as a third take an interest in the higher level fields of literature even in this area their response is of a far smaller intellectual range than the response of the middle london chatto  windus  class reader the political convictions which to any observer seemed to keep the social classes at arms length in twentieth century germany are revealed as having penetrated only very superficially into the workers minds only a small minority take a real interest in politics there certainly has not been a totalitarian gleichschaltung of the socialist workers minds causing their marxist or socialist opinions to penetrate every nook and cranny of their mental equipment on the whole the picture presented is of a very modest intellectual level one far more restricted than the middle class level and in many ways a considerably inferior copy of the middle class mental equipment there certainly is not the faintest promise of a proletarian culture or proletarian literature in the picture and it should be borne in mind that this is in a section of the working class which is especially closely related to the world of books and more intelligent and better educated than the majority of the german workers and that the analysis covers a period when socialism as such was unchallenged as the ideology of the german working class the period i  the general picture and reading trends while the first period of comparison i  generally speaking was one marked by the absence of long term mass unemployment and especially in its second half by a certain atmosphere of stabilization and prosperity the second period shows a completely different picture germany was hit by the most disastrous economic slump she had ever experienced and the economic crisis was paralleled by a most severe political crisis
 the library quarterly which finally led to the utter collapse of the weimar democracy and the establishment of hitler dictatorship during this period the socialist movement was in perpetual political retreat while the nazis were forging ahead at a breathtaking pace and even within the german labor movement the antagonism between the moderates social democrats and the extremists communists grew at an alarming rate how did the leipzig worker readers react to the upheavals around them by which many of them were directly hit as they were forced into the ever swelling ranks of the workless let us return to the figures of thier analysis as is to be expected there is a steep rise in the interest in politics and history another feature which is by no means so obvious and which needs some explanation is the simultaneous steep decline of interest in theoretical and general natural sciences this decline had already begun in the preceding years in a much less pronounced form but the impact of the slump accelerated it so sharply as to require some comment since the eighteen nineties when german socialist ideology attained its characteristic features two main influences had formed a kind of secular religion in this respect the german working class movement differed profoundly from that of british labor these two main influences were karl marx theory of historical materialism and charles darwin theory of natural evolution no matter in what form these philosophies were understood the faith in them had given german socialism its tremendous self assurance its fondly held belief that german socialism was scientific socialism and that german labor was theoretically backed by the most advanced philosophies of western europe one may smile at this naivete now but there is no doubt that this firm conviction was a considerable psychological asset in the selfless and idealistic struggle of thousands of german workers in building up their huge political and industrial organizations in the face of the bitter hostility of imperial germany in the quarter century i ii after the collapse of the old regime in ii socialism seemed to be the one great hope for a reconstruction of a new democratic germany and hundreds and thousands of middle class people found themselves attracted momentarily to the german labor movement which held out the promise of a better freer and more peaceful future in   there was a marvelous spirit abroad in many germans great springs of idealism and devoted effort were released in the hope of starting afresh on the ruins of discarded prussian militarism all this idealism and high minded endeavor was favorable to the socialist movement and looked to it as its chief protagonist no wonder that the working class readers members of a rapidly advancing and victorious movement felt more assured than ever of the profundity of their very own philosophy of life the marxist darwinian conception of social and natural history as they understood it especially in leipzig which had stood on the left of the movement for many years this nineteenth century materialist secular religion was particularly deeply ingrained no wonder that in the years ii  when to many germans socialism seemed to give the promise of a better world the two fields of interest politics and natural sciences the background for marx and darwin attracted to themselves a record number of worker readers the steep upward curve in the reading figures of these groups was but a facet of the optimism and self confidence
german working class reading and the rise of naziism  which was alive in the german socialist movement as a whole in the two years after the revolution of november ii how different is the picture ten years later while the interest in politics is on the increase this rise is as has been noted accompanied by a sharp decline of interest in the natural sciences an indication that the backbone of materialist orthodoxy was far less strong than in ii  whatever the shortcomings of this philosophy it had been a tower of strength to the german labor movement it had filled the workers with a messianic conviction that the victory of socialism was guaranteed by the laws of nature just as this philosophy had carried the russian bolsheviks through the most appalling risks and ordeals to their final victory the decline of interest in the natural sciences reveals that the working class faced the tremendous double challenge of the economic slump and of the nazi threat to the weimar republic with a far less intense belief in a secular religion than it had possessed in the early nineteen twenties nothing else had been developed to fill this vacuum so the result was purely negative the materialist philosophy had after all been some sort of bond between the workers and important intellectual currents of the past its weakening showed a victory of interest in the topical and the easily accessible over the sense of striving for a certain seriousness and philosophical foundations in one outlook a triumph of shallowness over depth in short a sad decline in the intellectual level all round everywhere in thier analysis of the period under review there appears the same picture of a loss of intensity of mental effort of the trends toward the more superficial aspects of life and toward the journalistic kind of literature instead of the book demanding more serious concentration the sober figures of the book issues to worker readers during the period of the slump show up starkly the appalling psychological impact of mass unemployment and political pessimism and defeatism in the working class mind a loss of the capacity for tackling serious problems and a reversion toward the primitive changes in the fields of interest of working class readers what happened to thier special groups of readers in the period under review the technically minded the literature minded and the rest by following their individual fates it may be possible to see if the facts fit the conclusions which have just been given by way of anticipation the group of the technically minded shrank there was no outlet for their type of interest in the world of mass unemployment around them the slump was too much for the intellectual equipment of this particular group as thier brutally states the modest mental level of this group clearly underwent further mental impoverishment in this period p  the impact of the slump which brought about a decline of interest in technology resulted in a steep increase of interest in travel and adventure as thier has it the slump in short favored the uncomplicated and primitive mentality which sought in books an anodyne from the unbearable present to use a hackneyed word escapism meant mental retrogression and escapism increased at the same pace as the numbers of the workless that is the unmistakable lesson which is taught by the sharply rising figures of worker readers of travel and adventure during the period one of the most remarkable features
io the library quarterly of this period is as thier stresses the discovery of the war book by the german worker he finds it very significant that just in this period of almost unbearable stress and strain the german worker suckled in a strongly antimilitarist and anti war creed by his socialist leaders found his way to this tremendous chapter of german history world war i there can be no quarrel with thier facts but an objection can be made to his insinuation that this discovery of the war book was a sort of mental preparation of the average leipzig socialist worker reader for the hitler spirit and the fateful date of september i the working class by no means lives in a watertight mental compartment of its own completely isolated from the currents influencing other classes of the population in germany the great wave of war books heralded by the sensational success of remarque all quiet on the western front in i coincided with the onset of the slump and of the nazi offensive the astounding popularity of the innumerable war books then flooding the german book market would not leave the working class untouched furthermore far from glorifying war many of the war books had an outspoken pacifist and anti war bias remarque book to begin with the most popular of all while another war book hasek schweijk which enjoyed an immense popularity with working class readers was downright subversive the political implications that thier insinuates ie a sympathetic approach of the traditionally pacifist german worker toward nationalism as shown by the popularity of the war book just before hitler came to power seems to be unfounded and heavily biased in favor of thier nazi point of view on the other hand the amazing popularity of the war book among the leipzig worker readers in this period fits in perfectly with the general picture of the trend toward escapism and the general lowering of the mental level again thier who so warmly welcomes the popularity of the war book as a sign of the conversion of the worker from materialist socialism to the pure gospel of naziism has to admit not only the readers of the adventure novel but those of the war novel also are of an extremely uncomplicated mentality in both cases interest in theory is overshadowed by the importance of immediate experience the most primitive type of working class reader found the way to the war book first to return from this digression to the discussion of the former special groups so far the figures have given a clear picture of the general prevailing trend the same impression is given by the fate which overtook the group of the literature minded during our period this group practically collapsed falling to a third of its former membership the same general trend appears in the changes which took place in the group of the politically minded there is a clear and unmistakable shift from the heavy general theoretical works to the more topical journalistic type of book dealing in a popular way with current affairs while in election times communism in creased at a considerable rate there was no parallel increase in the interest in marxist theory all the interest of the extreme left being concentrated on journalistic topical literature on soviet russia this is a sure sign of how very superficial the leftward trend of the pre hitler years was compared with the far more intellectually based leftward trend of igi from my own personal experience i can recall that many germans who as young men had arrived at ideals of a hu
german working class reading and the rise of naziism  manitarian democracy after the first world war stuck to these ideals throughout the twelve years of nazi rule while many leftist sympathizers of the slump period became nazi converts in no time naturally the length of the period during which a man holds certain opinions is an important factor but thier analysis corroborates the impression of the inflationary and superficial character of the communist electoral successes preceding the establishment of the third reich before summing up a last digression may be permitted to show that there is a good deal of nazi propaganda in thier scientific analysis after discussing the results of his statistics concerning the group of long term male adult readers which has formed the basis of the whole investigation hitherto he suddenly changes his method and abandons the chosen iooo lesehefte of the long term readers for a moment to turn his attention to a new and much wider field covering all the working class readers of the libraries in the period under review for a definite purpose concerning the circulation figures for mein kampf thier exclaims triumphantly the book of the fuhrer was the most read political book even among working class readers even before the national socialist revolution of i  while left wing politics took up almost the entire sphere of interest in i  in i  it no longer filled even half of that particular sphere while all this may be perfectly true thier has changed his method of analysis and a few critical words should suffice to puncture the triumph of the ex socialist nazi every librarian knows that there is a type of working class reader who is driven into a public library as a last resource in times of mass unemployment when his home is unheated and perhaps filled with other unemployed members of the family this type is not the most valuable sort of library reader and often his library membership ceases once a new job is found thus during the slump the number of worker readers in the leipzig public libraries rose sharply as we have seen and it fell equally abruptly when hitler put an end to unemployment in germany therefore when discussing the entire mass of worker readers during the slump we are bound to encounter a far more primitive level than hitherto the success of mein kampf among this mentally diluted mass of worker readers many of them mental driftwood whose average quality was much lower than that of the selected iooo long term readers is thus no particular reason for the nazi thier elation it was the typical success of the fashionable and the topical among the superficial and mediocre on the other hand the decline of interest in left wing literature even among this mixed crowd of serious and not soserious readers is a sign of the same decline in the political self assurance of the working class movement had this movement been in the ascendancy its literature would have attracted even the mental driftwood of the casual readers the defeat of the german socialist cause in i then still a thing of the future is tragically implied in the shrinkage of the field of interest of the leftist literature which no longer acted as a magnet in following the respective fates of the various special groups of worker readers we find that the figures show really movingly all the disastrous mental consequences of the economic and political crisis on the social group under review whatever the shortcomings of the traditional marxist materialist conception of history and nature this concep
i the library quarterly tion had been a source of strength and a stimulant to serious study in the peculiar political situation of germany between ii and  the socialist working class was the true backbone of the republican weimar democracy whose standard the middle classes had never really followed and which they attacked and bitterly renounced as soon as times got worse turning eagerly instead to the nazi gospel the mental weakening of the working class sapped the foundations of the weimar democracy when hitler sat himself in bismarck chair he was not confronted with the optimistic militant socialist movement of bismarck time with its utopian messianism and fervent belief in the cause of the brotherhood of man but with a discouraged disillusioned mass of passive victims the analysis of the reading of the selected groups of workers has demonstrated the victory of escapism only too clearly this attitude of mind preceded and made possible the victory of the archenemy of all the ideals the german working class movement had always stood for the reaction of working class readers to nazi dictatorship the reader outside germany may think that in this discussion the close connection between the world of books and the world of politics is exaggerated the nazis did not think so hardly had the hitler dictatorship been established after the german reichstag elections of march   than all over germany the fires were lit in which thousands and thousands of the books detested by the nazis were burned in solemn ceremonies i remember the unutterable sadness and sense of tragedy which came over me when walking in the streets of leipzig one fine day in the spring of  i suddenly saw black flakes hovering in the air all around me the charred remains of books which the nazi hangman had just delivered to the flames one must go back almost exactly four hundred years in german history to find a parallel the burning of dangerous books by another set of chiliastic fanatics in revolt against western civilization the miinster anabaptists of i a thoroughgoing purge swept over the german public libraries anything written by jewish socialist liberal and pacifist writers was ruthlessly eliminated from the shelves to the nazi mind russia and bolshevism formed a single sinister unit at a congress of german public library workers one librarian went so far as to declare the entire bulk of russian literature a borderline case in which it was not always easy to make up one mind whether to keep some specimens on the shelves or to pulp the lot how did the worker readers react to the huge upheaval around them here are thier comments the greater part of the marxist readers left the libraries some few returned to them a few years later in some cases they then studied national socialist literature intensively the readers of character obviously did not want to surrender to the new spirit without a struggle others read outspokenly nonpolitical books  the other sociologically interested readers did not react in a uniform way some of the older members of this group were obviously bewildered and disturbed for a long time they deplored the disappearance of the oldstyle novel of social criticism and were eagerly looking for any books which would satisfy their traditional psychological complexes of social resentment the younger ones found the way to the new situation more easily some of them dropped reading political books altogether for a time it cannot be said that these statements show a general conversion of all worker readers to the new nazi spirit but as we have seen the special group of outspok
german working class reading and the rise of naziism  enly left wing readers formed only a tiny minority among the whole number investigated  out of iooo in i  furthermore one would not expect that this tiny group devoted sincerely and often dogmatically to the marxist ideology or to advanced social philosophies in general would immediately cross over to the nazi camp the orthodox believer who has been devoted to some ideology for years is not likely to become a renegade at once when the times change but this type of reader is in every class the exception and not the rule some of thier remarks reveal something of a spirit of passive resistance for example he admits a steep decline of interest in political literature as one of the results of the new regime the vacuum created by the purge of the traditional leftist books was not filled by new political nazi books so far as worker readers were concerned thier analyzes i book issues to worker readers during the years of the nazi period these books dealt with three subjects the world war nazi politics and race theory of the total number of books issued in these three categories those dealing with race theory constituted a miserable  per cent p  thier is forced to comment race theory is not yet sufficiently appreciated by the working class readers  we are still waiting for the development of this particular sphere of interest conclusions whatever dr thier intentions when writing his work as an analysis of the cultural disintegration of a section of a social class under the impact of an unparalleled economic and political crisis the book has succeeded in drawing a striking picture of the atmosphere out of which hitler rose to power republican germany being what it was the class whose mental impoverishment in those years has been so clearly revealed happened to be the only class which fervently believedn democracy and was opposed to dictatorship and ideas of world conquest the mental collapse of the working class heralded the political collapse of the weimar republic the dryas dust statistics of the leipzig public libraries forecast the humiliating day when the german socialist trade union leaders issued a proclamation asking the millions of their followers to march behind hitler banners in the nazi procession of triumph of may i i i do not wish to make excessive claims for the importance of the book which has been surveyed but i venture to think that investigations of this kind if undertaken in a spirit of the search for truth will result in a better understanding of the problems of our time connections between the political climate of a period and its popular reading have been pointed out before but attempts at a systematic treatment are rare it will be recalled that the great german historian franz mehring was struck by the sudden revival of interest in schopenhauer philosophy which characterized the period after the defeat of the german democratic revolution of i similarly russian historians discussing the period after the russian revolution of i another defeated democratic revolution have drawn attention to the amazing vogue of erotic and pornographic literature at this time exemplified by the sensational success of artsybashev sanin a novel long since forgotten in both cases these were aspects of the reaction of the german and russian middle classes to the shattering of their cherished political hopes and illusions allowing for the differences in place and peri
 the library quarterly od from my own personal experience i should like to quote two examples of the interconnection of politics and culture which are perhaps not quite so well known the first years of the weimar republic in keeping with the whole temper of the period were characterized by a great advance of the german adult education movement after the year of inflation of i had ended with a defeat for democracy resulting in a feeling of disillusionment among the supporters of the republic the whole german adult education movement underwent a catastrophic slump from which it took many years to recover the second example is again in the field of reading habits no german living through the years of slump preceding hitler dictatorship could remain unaware of a most sinister symptom of mental disintegration staring at him from every newspaper stall almost every week a new astrological journal was added to the list of those already existing and the increasing popularity of this kind of literature at the time throws yet another sidelight on the mental condition of the german nation at the moment when hitler was struggling for power there must be many such examples crying out for systematic treatment and perhaps we shall see the day when there will be a historical school of social psychology including the study of the reading habits of classes and nations as one of its branches if the present summary stimulates research along these lines even the book of the ardent nazi will have supplied a few of the tools for such an enterprise
