information as property and as a public good perspectives from the economic theory of property rights roger a mccain some issues relating to property in information are reviewed in the light of recent work on the economic theory of property rights according to this theory costs of transaction are central to the evaluation of property rights and related public policy accordingly special circumstances relative to transaction costs are considered in the cases of public libraries photocopying computer software and satellite television feeds property rights are among the central institutions of a market economy this being so it is remarkable that until the latter half of this century there was hardly anything that could be called an economic theory of property rights but see i since  however a substantial literature has grown up on the economic theory of property rights which typically relates property rights to the cost of transacting this literature seems not to be well known outside the economics profession the purpose of this paper is first to survey that theory in terms accessible to the noneconomist and second to apply it to four issues in the economics of information the first section undertakes the survey its contents are expository rather than original and are offered here for the convenience of the noneconomist reader in understanding the analysis of the second section which undertakes the applications a brief final section summarizes and concludes  i am indebted to katherine w mccain of drexel university for comments on information and library science that have contributed significantly to the conception and content of this paper to barbara wildemuth of the same institution for valuable comments on a preliminary draft and to anonymous referees for valuable comments shortcomings of the paper are attributable to me  fordham university department of economics the bronx new york  library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved        
 the library quarterly an overview of some recent economic thought on property rights one venerable possible world in economic theory is a world in which all economic activity is mediated through markets that is through property rights and the exchange of property rights in such a world there is no economically relevant government activity one can describe a possible world in which the outcome of these market processes is efficient and indeed defines an ideal of efficiency and that particular possible world is an important touchstone of economic theory in what follows i will refer to it as the world of ideal markets some economists however have argued that markets untrammeled by government intervention will not produce efficient results in the actual world since markets do not attain efficiency in the sense of the world of ideal markets this is often called market failure  although that term is controversial in the literature under review a historically important and illustrative case comes from environmental economics the case of riparian rights that is rights to the preservation of a river suppose that a large number of people own real property along the bank of a river if one person builds a dam or otherwise modifies the flow of the river in the section where he owns property it will modify the nature of the property owned by some of the others perhaps depriving them of benefits that they would otherwise have enjoyed has a property owner the right to build a dam or has he the right to enjoy his riverbank with a river unmodified by the constructions of others on their property if the property owner has the right to his riverbank unmodified by the constructions of others then property rights are riparian otherwise they are not thus we have two possible systems of property rights and in principle they might have different results suppose in particular that the existing property rights system is nonriparian so that river residents have the right to build dams but building a dam is inefficient we must be precise as to what we mean when we say that building the dam is inefficient it means this  if the dam is built some people lose and others gain and  those who lose lose more in this specific sense if the potential losers were to conspire and bribe the potential dam builder not to build the dam they would be better off than they are if the dam is actually built they would be worse off by the amount of the bribe but that is less than their loss if the dam is built this is the formal meaning of the economist locution that the costs exceed the benefits of the dam here cost is shorthand for losses if the dam is built and benefits is  this is referred to as the compensation test for efficiency see   the first two of these are reprinted in  note the introductory discussion pp  
economic theory of property rights  shorthand for minimum necessary bribe whenever we evaluate an economic outcome as efficient inefficient we are saying that while some lose and others gain by it the gainers gain more less thn the losers lose it follows that efficiency and distribution are separate issues and evaluation on the basis of efficiency abstracts radically from all questions of distribution in the world of ideal markets inefficient outcomes such as the building of the dam in this example do not occur thus the building of the dam under nonriparian rights would be an instance of market failure theorists of market failure would say that there are three possible responses of the public authority to this market failure first it may be tolerated but supposing that the inefficiency is not to be tolerated second the public authority might legislate a change of property rights changing the legal system to one of riparian rights in that case the dam presumably would not be built third if the inefficiency was not to be tolerated but the property rights for some reason could not be changed then the public authority might resort to regulation legislating a ban on dam building requiring a license for dams to be built and requiring an environmental impact statement or placing a tax on dams thus the theory of market failure is sometimes put forward as an efficiency based justification for government action in the actual world ronald coase  and his followers criticize the concept of market failure and all that is supposed to follow from it their criticism is based on the economist conception of efficiency if indeed the potential losers can bribe the potential dam builder to desist and they fail to do so there must be some reason why they fail to do so perhaps the costs of organizing a conspiracy or committee contacting potential losers negotiating an agreement to share the costs of the bribe and enforcing the agreement are large these costs are costs of transactionin this case the costs of the bribe transaction if the potential losers fail to bribe the potential dam builder then it must be because the costs of transac this assumption is of course questionable and has often been questioned in economic theory whenever any law or public policy is supported or opposed on efficiency grounds however this questionable abstraction is unavoidably accepted in economics discussion of these matters is called welfare economics  there has been a large literature from this school the following are some important or distinctive papers with no claims made for comprehensiveness or any particular logic in the selection coase  seems to have introduced transaction costs into the literature of economic theory coase  founded the transaction cost theory of property rights demsetz   has been a major contributor to the literature and ideas of the school as have cheung  and frech   for surveys note    note also   and for a distinctive trend within the school that is relatively friendly to government intervention note  
 the library quarterly tion in doing so are so great that the losers would actually be worse off not better off than they would be if the dam were built but the costs of transaction were left out of account when the dam was declared inefficient so that judgment of inefficiency is incomplete and must be reconsidered this example illustrates that transaction costs are central to the modern economics of property rights the following propositions summarize much of the recent economic thinking on property rights the second and third are due to coase and together they are sometimes referred to as the coase theorem  one of the defining characteristics of the world of ideal markets is that it is a world without transaction costs in a world without transaction costs all systems of property rights are equally efficient since market processes exchanges of property rights will lead to their reallocation if they are initially allocated inefficiently in the actual world systems of property rights differ from one another in the transaction costs that they imply so that some systems of property rights may be preferable to others on total cost grounds inclusive of transaction costs proposals for the reform or regulation of property rights cannot be valid unless they take transaction costs fully into account much of the coasian literature draws the panglossian conclusion   that when transaction costs are fully taken into account whatever is is optimalthat is efficient i have argued that this conclusion is incorrect   and that many of the traditional arguments for government intervention in the market system in economic theory can be reinterpreted in transaction cost terms and are valid when this is done  the ultimate issue may well be a philosophical one relating to the meaningfulness of proposals for reform thus the theory of property rights must be regarded as a part of the more general theory of transaction costs and other aspects of the theory of transaction costs may illuminate issues in the economics of information one instance is found in burnham beckwith economic theory of free provision  beckwith argued that it may be efficient to distribute some goods or services free of charge and without rationing it is true of course that when a good is distributed free people will take  see for example    j  the term theorem though often used is not apposite taken as it is from mathematics the coasian literature is quite nonmathematical and nothing to compare with mathematical proof of a result from clearly and formally stated assumptions is to be found in it perhaps the term coase doctrine would be more apposite provided that it is understood that the word doctrine carries no pejorative intent  note also demsetz  however demsetz speaks specifically of free provision by the private profit motivated sector his example is supermarket parking spaces
economic theory of property rights  more of that good than would be taken in the world of ideal markets in most cases and in that sense free distribution is inefficient but again this analysis is incomplete in that it overlooks the costs of transaction in distributing the goods al a price there will be some costs administrative costs and so forth of excluding those who do not pay or who are not entitled to the good under a rationing scheme thus the costs of transaction saved by free distribution may more than outweigh the waste of resources due to overuse of the free good or service making free distribution relatively efficient this will be related to the free provision of information services discussed below i hope that enough has been said to demonstrate that the analysis of transaction costs is both necessary and promising as a basis for a systematic economics of property rights in information and of public policy with respect to information more generally the applications in the next section will draw on the following maxims  because transaction costs exist in the actual world some systems of property rights may be preferable to others on total cost grounds coase see above  it is relatively efficient to assign property rights to those who would ultimately obtain them in the world of ideal markets rather than to those who would not since it may be presumed that no transactions are then required and thus no transaction costs incurred wittman   it is efficient for the government to provide any service for which a the benefits exceed the costs inclusive of all transaction costs of government provision and b the government transaction costs of so doing are less than the transaction costs that would be incurred in provision of the same service through private exchanges of property rights mccain   provision of a good or service without charge or rationing is efficient if the saving of costs of transaction in excluding nonpayers or others from the use of the service is greater than the transaction costs of providing the service free through a nonprofit agency where those transaction costs include the waste of resources due to overuse of the free service beckwith  applications in this section four specific applications of the transaction cost theory of property rights and free distribution in the economics of information are explored the issues are photocopying copy protection of computer software encryption of satellite television feeds and public libraries these examples illustrate a more general point it is rarely the case that arguments from property rights support only one side of an issue of policy in the instance of riparian rights there are property rights on both sides this will be true of the four applications in the economics of information as well moreover when we take transaction costs into account considerations of efficiency may support either side depending
 the library quarterly on the relative magnitudes of the various costs thus it is generally incorrect to formulate issues as economic values versus other values instead there will be economic valuesthat is property rights arguments and efficiency arguments on both sides nevertheless in each of the four cases there is an economic argument on one side of the issue that is well known while the economic arguments on the other side are not well known i shall attempt to support the general point by articulating the latter copying technology transaction costs and property in information recent progress in copying technology has sometimes been said to undermine property rights in information and has been the occasion of recent legislation intended to extend protection of those rights has this any basis in the economic theory of property rights we may distinguish between the information and the medium in which it is embodied that is books magnetic discs electromagnetic waves and so forth it is by no means a given that the information will be the more valuable item when books had to be copied by hand on parchment the parchment may well have been the more valuable item as the existence of medieval palimpsests parchments reused at the cost of the information they had earlier embodied suggests the effect of improvements in copying technology is to reduce the cost of the medium thus for example with the invention of paper and printing the value of information became a much larger proportion of the total value of the book not because the information is more valuable but because the physical book itself is cheaper this made the free enterprise of stealing the information by unauthorized reproduction a more plausible and profitable one before these developments there was presumably no need for copyright law it should be stressed that the case for copyright law is not a case for property against anarchy but a case for one property right and against another copyright law deprives the proprietor of a printing press of the right to use it just as he sees fit thus the parallel to the case of riparian versus nonriparian rights is precise but the invention of the new copying technology printing will have changed the balance of advantage as between the two systems of property rights and may well have done so in a definitive way free copying reduces the profitability of resources that produce information in a world of positive transaction costs and the loss of information that would otherwise be produced is a cost that must be charged against the property system with free copying a legal system with copying limited by copyright imposes two kinds of cost first there are resources used up in the negotiation and enforcement of licenses to copy second and probably more important there is the wasteful
economic theory of property rights  underuse of the copying technology that results from raisins the prices of copies above the marginal cost to cover the average overhead cost of the copyright fee this dichotomy parallels one in the literature on the diffusion of information longer patent periods will encourage the production of innovations but slow their diffusion the parallel is precise with copyright we have too little production of copies but without copyright too little production of original works but when the cost of information of the original work is small by comparison with the cost of the copy as it was before the invention of printing the balance seems likely to favor free copying when the cost of information is a larger proportion of the whole cost the balance is less favorable to free copying and perhaps copyright law emerges as a result compare  but then what are the implications of the emergence of the still newer copying technology photocopying we should observe that photocopying is not cheaper than printing but the relation of variable costs and overhead costs is different photocopying is more expensive for long runs but cheaper for very short runs this implies that the copying activity is more dispersed and far more likely to be done for one own use or for use by one immediate associates than for sale for profit the principal result is to raise the cost of enforcement of copyright laws and copyright licenses if copyright law is construed as prohibiting unauthorized photocopying these transaction costs could be quite large they would include the costs of contacting the author or publisher negotiating a contract and processing the payment recent legislation establishing a national clearinghouse for these purposes would reduce these costs and constitutes a recognition of their importance they may still remain very high the time required to write and post a check to the copyright center may well have a value several times that of the check  moreover the cost of enforcement of the law is also a real transaction cost of a system of property in information and it seems quite likely that if the law were really enforced the resources necessary to do so would cost considerably more than the revenues that they would generate for the information producers finally there is also the cost of wasteful underuse of copies by raising the price of copying to cover the transaction cost of granting permission to do it we further inefficiently restrict the number of copies and this too is a cost that must be charged against the system of  some of these points have recently been discussed in thejournal of political economy  novos and waldman  argue that there is no wasteful underuse since they say copying is not cheaper than printing but as liebowitz  points out their comment is mistaken precisely in overlooking the flexibility of copying on a small scale note also katz and shapiro  on related issues with particular reference to video cassettes
 the library quarterly property rights in information what is the cost of granting the privilege to copy a particular work already in print i believe we may confidently put it at zero photocopying cannot affect the cost of information already in print for the reason that the present cannot affect the past of course if the privilege to copy is made a part of the property rights of owners of copiers it extends also to works that might be produced in the future and so may discourage the production of new books thus as usual there are costs and benefits on both sides but what is new in photocopying is precisely the possibility to benefit by flexible small scale copying and the high cost of enforcing its prohibition thus just as the emergence of printing favored a legal system that protected the property rights of producers of information so the emergence of photocopy technology seems to favor a property rights system that secures the proprietor of a copying machine in his property right to copy whatever he pleases this is not to say that the latter legal system is clearly preferable but rather that the case for protection of property rights in information from photocopying is far less strong when we consider transaction costs than the case for protecting them from the printing press computer software and copy protection computer software too may be copied cheaply for short runs on a small scale and so is subject to many of the same issues that arise in the case of photocopying here again we have a choice between two incompossible property rights the right of the buyer to copy as he may wish and the right of the originator to control copying there are some important differences however one of these is the possibility of copy protection it does not seem to be possible within the state of the printer art to protect a book in print technologically from photocopying it is possible to some degree to protect software from copying should we then affirm or deny the programmer property right to produce and sell copy protected programs should we regulate it copy protection is not perfect of course which introduces yet another complication not present in the issue of photocopying some kinds of software exist for the simple purpose of circumventing copy protection if programmers protect their software the result may simply be that the users all buy software to circumvent that protection  the  johnson  stresses the trade off between copying and production of original works liebowitz  questions that too noting that free copying increases the productivity of the originals and so may increase rather than decrease the effective demand for them  liebowitz comment j would apply here as well see n  above
economic theory of property rights  net result then is that both users and producers simply spend more resources than they would spend if there were no copy protection in effect we have a copy protection and zapping arms race now arms races are inherently wasteful and this might seem to be a powerful argument in favor of prohibiting copy protection it seems hasty to draw any such conclusion however on the one hand copy protection probably has some net effect that is it seems very unlikely that all users will buy zapping programs and copy at will on the other hand it is not clear whether a software industry is even sustainable in the long run in the absence of some protection against copying this seems to be a case in which the potential transaction costs and wastes attributable to both systems of property rights could be quite large thus a case might be made for either system of property rights depending on one judgment of their relative magnitude the case is instructive nevertheless in showing how in some circumstances the simple suppression of a property right may by preventing arms racelike behavior make all parties concerned better off even those whose rights are suppressed  satellite television and enctyption in the reception of satellite television feeds by the owners of private satellite dish antennas we had until recently another case to parallel those of riparian rights photocopying and copying of software a case in which the property rights of producers of satellite television feeds conflict with the property rights of owners of satellite dish antennas  it may be asked why the sustainability of the publishing industry was not at issue in the previous section vis avis photocopying i am indebted to barbara wildemuth for this point the main reason is empirical publishing has coexisted with photocopying for two decades however commercial software is a new industry until a few years ago most software production took place under autarky that is software was produced by the user or was provided by the sellers of computing machines i have observed that when both public and private provision of an activity are subject to high transaction costs then autarky may be optimal  online information services are also a new enough industry that we may wish to raise the sustainability issue apropos of garfield comments paraphrased in de gennaro  see n  below as noted there the loss of a private sector may not or may be regrettable if there is a public activity to substitute for it there is essentially no free public provision of software however and it is interesting that no one has proposed such a thing  free isublic provision of computer software might well bejustifiable on transaction cost grounds given the high costs assignable to both property systems in the case of software a precedent and a model for the provision of information largely used in a business context may be found in the agricultural extension system on that model the research to develop new software packages would be done at public expense in public universities and disseminated to users through specialized institutions for the purpose
 the library quarterly there is one important difference however in this case we may be able to resolve the issue by reference to the wittman maxim wittman maxim has not been called on before because it speaks only of the allocation of property rights to goods already in existence where the existence of the good is in question wittman maxim is not clearly applicable it would do no good for example to allocate the right to copy software to the users of the software if the long run result would be that no commercial software would be available in the case of the satellite television feeds however the case is somewhat different these feeds are produced for another purpose network and cable programming and their production does not seem to be at issue in the absence of transaction costs in the ideal world of free markets how would these rights ultimately be allocated we may i think state that they would be allocated to the owners of satellite dish antennas because the marginal cost of doing so is zero and the price that prevails in the ideal world of perfect markets is equal to the marginal cost thus on wittman maxim the property right to receive satellite broadcasts ought to be allocated to the owners of the satellite dish antennas the recent development that has changed the case somewhat is the emergence of encryption of satellite feeds at the source if the question is one of property rights it may appear that there is only one property right at issue with respect to encryption the putative property right of broadcasters to encrypt what they broadcast we shall see that this is not correct but suppose for now that it is the right to encrypt has been granted by the public authority on certain conditions but perhaps it ought not have been granted first the cost of the decryption machines which are reportedly being offered with the authorization of some of the companies that produce the feeds is quite high  p   this cost is a transaction cost that must be charged against the benefits if any from encryption second since the marginal cost of reception of satellite television feeds is zero any price above zero will result in wasteful underuse of the satellite dish antennas which should also be charged against encryption in a complete assessment of its costs and benefits third the benefits to the providers of satellite feeds from encryption seem likely to be very small indeed the elasticity of demand for satellite television is not zero which is the economist way of saying that when the price goes up from zero some of the demanders will drop out of the market  more will drop out when the very high costs of transaction are added to the price paid to the producers of the satellite television feeds thus the revenues generated will be less than proportional to the number of demanders now in the market and they may be very much less depending on the elasticity of demand fourth it is an open question whether these revenues will
economic theory of property rights  generate any gross benefits of comparable magnitude to viewers the gross benefits to viewers would take the form of more and better satellite television programming produced with a view to capturing the custom of dish antenna owners given however that the feeds are produced for another purpose that would continue to be the predominant market and given the economies of scale in production of television feeds this expansion of programming could be quite small by comparison with the transaction costs against which it is to be charged  moreover there is in fact a property rights argument on the other side the law prohibits the use of decryption devices not authorized by the producers of the satellite feeds that is it suppresses the property rights of owners of decryption devices to use them freely if it did not do so then encryption would surely be nearly useless in the long run indeed even with the law in place it seems to be only a matter of time before illicit decryption technologies appear in the market and further expenditure will be required of the producers of satellite television feeds in order to prevent circumvention of their copy protection thus again as in the case of software copy protection we have arms race like behavior public enforcement of the antidecryption regulation could be very costly if not impossible without infringement of the viewer right to  besen manning and mitchell  take up the issue and make reference to the coasian reasoning however their quick dismissal of transaction costs pp   misses the point spectacularly though they wrote before satellite feeds were used they argue for assigning property rights to broadcast stations which would permit the stations to exclude cable systems from carrying their broadcasts they support this with a numerical example however with a small change of numbers their example supports the opposite argument that is that cable systems should have the right to carry whatever is broadcast and this ambiguity of result is precisely the point of this paper  these devices probably already exist  moreover the present law may not be very effective in preventing unauthorized decryption an inventor who has partially cracked an encryption scheme notes that it would be illegal to sell his black box for purposes of illicit decryption he conjectures however that it would be legal under the present law if he were to buy an hour a week of uplink time on a bird and scramble it anyone who wanted to watch my hour of programming would have to use one of my sets of course if it also happened to descramble hbo cinemax and others at the same time that not my problem  p  it would still be illegal for the viewer to use the receiver to decrypt feeds for hbo and other cable services without permission but for our purposes the point is that the costs to the public authority of enforcing this prohibition would then be quite large these costs are costs of transaction another apparent loophole is that some cable operators have been willing to sell premium services such as hbo to viewers outside their cable franchise areas these are not supplied by cable feed but the cable company supplies the decoder and retails the service to the viewer who then obtains it by means of his satellite dish antenna while hbo has refused to authorize service under these circumstances there is evidently no technical means of preventing it  p 
 the library quarterly privacy and this too is a transaction cost that must be charged against the right to encrypt system of property rights i conclude that there is a case for the prohibition of encryption or at least for permitting free decryption and that the case may be very strong indeed when transaction costs and related costs are fully taken into account public libraries and the free distribution of information in the united states there is a long tradition of the free provision of library services as a local public service several issues pertain to this a matter of property in information will be taken first the issue of how public subsidies to libraries may be justified in terms of efficiency second and the issue of free distribution of information per se will be considered third with respect to property rights it may be argued that free public libraries inherently infringe the rights of authors publishers and other producers of information since the organization of free lending arrangements may substitute for the sale of books or other information services in so doing it may reduce the incentive to produce books or other information services making the community worse off on net now first the argument would apply equally to private rental libraries and to clubs that are not subsidized by the public authority but are supported by dues paid by members who then have borrowing privileges thus what we have here is another case parallel to that of riparian rights shall producers of books have the right to sell those books free of competition from rental or lending services or shall people and local communities have the right to organize rental and lending services again the answer depends on the specific numbers to the extent if any that libraries discourage the sale and so the production of books  that lending could reduce the supply of books is recognized in the debate surrounding the proposed public lending rightthat is the right of authors to be compensated when their books are lent     however this debate also provides a good example of one sided argument with respect to property rights as information that there are property rights and cost benefit arguments on the other side of the issue does not seem to have been noticed even by the opponents of the proposal  another recognition of this cost is seen in garfield opposition to free public supply of information in competition with the private sector  p  as de gennaro says no one disputes garfield right to sell information  p  yet it is not selfevident that this right is efficient there are as  and  note transaction cost circumstances in which it is efficient to suppress a profitable private sector in order to concentrate activity in the public sector as there are circumstances in which it is efficient to concentrate activity in the private sector it depends on the numbers once again one sided argument dominates the discussion
economic theory of property rights  that would be a transaction cost of free provision a form of wasteful overuse of the lending service which would have to be taken into account in a full assessment of the efficiency of lending libraries on the other hand to the extent that the taste for books is a cultivated taste it is not clear that free libraries will have the effect of reducing the retail demand for books on net they may encourage cultivation of taste and so have the opposite effect increasing the retail demand for books compare especially   with respect to the demand for artistic goods and services in general that would put the entire issue in rather a different light but even excluding cultivation of taste for reading a public lending right would be inefficient if the cost of enforcing it a cost of transaction were greater than the benefits to readers of the books that would not be produced without it that seems quite possible why have public libraries at all it is beyond the scope of this paper to review the economic literature on public libraries which is in any case modest however one point that emerges from that literature is that library services may be the object of an option demand   this means that people may be willing to pay something to have a library available even if they do not routinely use it a particularly clear instance of option demand is the case of hospital services for emergency cardiac care many of us might pay substantially to have these available even if we hope never to use them while library services do not provide an equally clear case people may be willing to pay to have libraries available for themselves and their children even in periods when they do not in fact use the libraries and would thus not be called on to pay an admission fee at the door if such fees were charged such a demand could in principle be served by a sort of club arrangement in which only dues paying members were permitted to use the library here again though costs of transaction would become crucial the costs of contacting informing assessing dues and so on could be   have argued that cultivation of taste may justify government intervention   but my argument assumes a kind of predictably irrational behavior quite foreign to the transaction cost literature thus to date the argument from cultivation of taste has not been cast into the transaction costs mold it ought to be if only for consistency with the arguments in the balance of this paper i offer a starting point  note also  in the form of a game theoretic explanation for the irrationality of  the explanation is that people act shortsightedly because farsighted action can benefit them only if it is coordinated an agreement to coordinate would be a transaction and the costs of such a transaction could be quite high so the failure of people to cultivate tastes efficiently like other arguments for government intervention is reducible to transaction costs at least tentatively  for examples see  
 the library quarterly quite high relative to the direct costs of providing library services some individuals may play games letting their dues lapse until such time as they choose to use the library and thus in effect getting the option for free deterring such behavior will have costs and we conventionally include the costs of deterring or coping with strategic behavior among the transaction costs if this line of reasoning is correct then the transactional costs of supplying library services through the private sector would be high if it were lower in the public sector this would justify public provision of libraries but these public libraries might well charge for some of their services indeed probably almost all libraries do charge for some services as for example for photocopying but the price of most services is often placed at zero can there be an efficiency rationale for this practice or must it be regarded as expressive of noneconomic values in this connection it is sometimes said that public libraries provide a public good if so that would justify the efficiency of free distribution according to a well known analysis of samuelson  but the description is incorrect in terms of samuelson theory a public good is not a good that happens to be provided by the public authority in samuelson discussion but one for which public free provision is appropriate public provision is appropriate because the public good by definition has both of the following characteristics it is nonexclusive and cost independent to say that the good is nonexclusive is to say that for some reason it is infeasible to exclude from its benefits those who do not pay for them therefore the good will not be providedy the private sector or it will not be adequately or ordinarily so provided to say that the good is cost independent is to say that the cost of providing it does not depend on the number of units consumed as for example the cost of putting on a television broadcast does not increase when one more person tunes in are public libraries public goods in this sense it seems clear that they are not it is quite feasible to exclude those who do not pay rental libraries do exist moreover while the cost of library service may be independent of use at low rates of use it is most unlikely that it remains so at high rates of use  public libraries have neither of the characteristics that define a samuelsonian public good i have argued  that samuelson analysis is a special case of the broader argument for free provision of some goods given by beckwith can the public library be an instance of the beckwith free good to establish that this is so we would have to establish that the marginal cost of many library services is low by comparison with the transaction costs that would result if these services were offered on a fee for
economic theory of property rights  service basis there is little need to speculate about these costs for the purposes of this paper it is enough to notice that a judgment of the efficiency of free distribution of library services cannot be made in abstract but must depend on the numbers and could go either way however there may be a deeper issue here and a point about which economists have something to learn the visible transaction costs can assuredly be small the cost of registering checkout and check in of books must be borne in any case and the collection of a fee at this stage probably would entail little if any additional cost are there less visible transaction costs that arise from the peculiarities of information as a commodity we simply do not know for some arguments that information is indeed economically peculiar note arrow  and mccain  this remains a controversial and unsettled area of economic theory here again then there is no confrontation between economic values and other values there is at least a possibility that free distribution of information may be efficient but we do confront the limits of modern economic knowledge and the question could be more clearly addressed if we knew more than we do about the economic nature of information summary and conclusion issues of efficient property rights and public policy cannot be understood without considering the costs of transaction that the property rights or policies occasion and those transaction costs must be construed very broadly as including any unavoidable wastes that a particular system of transactions implies when we do take transaction costs into account issues having to do with property in information and information provision are clarified in general theory does not answer the questions of which system of property rights or which policy is best because the answers depend on the relative magnitudes of the transaction costs on both sides in some cases however plausible guesses about the magnitudes of the costs support tentative conclusions thus though public libraries are clearly not public goods there is a case for their public provision on transaction cost grounds similarly the case for  it should be observed that technological progress can reduce the costs of exclusion if so then a good that would optimally have been supplied free by the public sector before the technical innovation might optimally be provided through the market afterward it seems likely that directory assistance formerly free but now generally provided at a price is a case in point
