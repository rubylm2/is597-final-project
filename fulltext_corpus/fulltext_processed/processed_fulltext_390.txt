new approaches to preservation richard daniel smith i introduction the preservation of library materials is a major concern of librarians increasing numbers of books are so badly deteriorated they cannot be circulated persons in many fields are experimenting with and searching for ways to improve preservation practices the objectives of this discussion are to review existing technology and report upon new approaches that librarians may apply to preserving and restoring library paper materials in the future highly stable printing papers and book components will be more widely used in the manufacture of books present day library collections however are largely composed of books printed on unstable paper a substantial percentage of these books were not manufactured for permanent use and libraries will continue to acquire significant works printed on impermanent paper the novel preservation treatments presented in this report are applicable for most books already in libraries and for books to be printed on unstable papers of the foreseeable future the preservation of books and records is not a new problem over  years ago an egyptian scribe reported that papyrus scrolls in his charge had to be dried and unrolled to determine whether the rain had washed off the ink writing  p  line  p  line   within a century or two after the invention of paper in china the chinese were treating paper to prevent attack by insects and book worms by ad  they felt they knew enough to preserve paper for several hundred years  pp   in  shakespeare wrote so should my papers yellowed with their age  be scorn like old men of less truth than tongue  p  in the early  s european scholars complained that irresponsible and profiteering papermakers were selling dirty thin paper  p  the scholars believed the government should force papermakers to produce good paper just like the paper produced in shakespeare time we also show a tendency to view the this investigation was made possible by encouragement guidance and support from the chicago testing laboratory chicago ill the council on library resources inc washington dc the institute of paper chemistry appleton wis and the department of chemistry the oriental institute the toxicity laboratory and the graduate library school of the university of chicago chicago il the allied chemical corp chicago ill e i dupont de nemours  co chicago ill harshaw chemical co hinsdale ill hercules incorporated chicago ill m  t chemicals inc rahway nj morton chemical co chicago ill and stauffer chemical co new york ny kindly donated many of the chemicals used in the experimental work a large number of individuals both within and without the above organizations made contributions to this research particularly significant assistance from five of them calls for recognition howard w winger professor the graduate library school brought the problem to my attention don r swanson dean the graduate library school supported my research bertie l browning senior research assocate the institute of paper chemistry gave me an appredation for the complex nature of paper and guided much of the research harold w tribolet manager department of extra binding r r donnelley  sons co chicago ill evaluated my ideas from the viewpoint of a practicing conservator and walter a wozniak chief chemist the chicago testing laboratory helped me with experimental and testing problems the results presented represent a summary of the author doctoral research 
 the library quarterly past through rose colored glasses today librarians have few problems with rain insects book worms and dirty thin paper but they complain about the impermanence of paper produced since the introduction of wood fiber sources during the s this emphasis on the period beginning with  is not  percent accurate fifty years ago chapman investigated the condition of paper in books of the imperial library in calcutta india   he discovered that books published before  were also deteriorating and that some of these books were in a far more critical condition than books published after  he identified bleaching practices and new paper fiber sources as the probable causes of the unstable paper manufactured between  and  and recognized that a solution to the problem of deteriorating books would require the efforts of many specialists chapman compared books from the imperial library with identical copies from other libraries located on the hot indian plains in the himalayan foothills part time on the plains and part time in the foothills and in england he found that books stored under cooler conditions in england and in the himalayan foothills had longer useful lives likewise moving the books from the plains to the foothills reduced the rate of deterioration in  chapman was so agitated about book losses that he actually proposed moving the imperial library collection to the foothills  miles from the reading rooms in calcutta  p  by  he modified his stand and wanted to aircondition the proposed new library building  pp   air conditioning using refrigerants for cooling did not really begin to develop until the early s chapman desire for airconditoning was no less radical farsighted than his desire to move the collection chapman fully appreciated the effect of storage conditions on the life of books and through chemical analyses established that an association existed between acidity and paper deterioration we now know that acidity in paper is the main cause of paper deterioration and that poor storage conditions accelerate the rate of paper deterioration the reactions which cause books to deteriorate occur after the books are received by libraries theoretically therefore librarians have the ability to make decisions and take whatever action is necessary to stretch out the useful life of books some knowledge about the manner in which paper deteriorates may be helpful in planning and scheduling preservation work in libraries  the nature of paper deterioration the manner in which paper deteriorates is highly significant permanence and durability are the two characteristics of paper involved permanence is the capacity of paper to retain its original characteristics and durability reflects the ability of paper to stand up in use  all book papers probably have more durability than would be required for use in research libraries if the use occurred when the papers were new and strong unfortunately research library patrons do not use books only when the paper is new and strong a book may be used infrequently in research libraries and over prolonged periods of time the disintegration of books has been predicted by generations of librarians but the books still stand upon the shelves embrittled perhaps but intact to explain this we must understand
new approaches to preservation  that the real life rate of deterioration is not a straight line it is an exponential curve descending sharply at first and then leveling off to push total disintegration into the far distant future the straight and curved lines in figure  are two ways of visualizing the very same loss in folding endurance because time is not specified figure  can be considered as a generalization for all types of paper the left axis and the straight line represent the logarithmic relationship this form is highly regarded by scientists because the line can be extended to make a prediction of future properties the right axis and curved or exponential line give information more significant to librarians because the curve represents the actual number of folds before the paper breaks paper loses folding endurance very rapidly at first and then more and more slowly as time goes on it may be helpful when considering fig  to remember that the logarithmic numbers    and  are equal to    and about  the exponential rate of paper deterioration suggests three things  books will remain intact on the shelves indefinitely after their leaves become so embrittled that the pages cannot be turned papyrus scrolls are examples of this effect  permanence or a low rate of deterioration is far more important than durability when books will be used infrequently over long periods of time  the best time to treat books for preservation is when they are new and strong  a program for preservation each library must consider its own responsibilities and means when planning a preservation program no single plan can be recommended for all libraries popular libraries of ready reference tools and best sellers are chiefly   ln  p   logarithm of  folding endurance    o  co  _ _ z o foldin e endurance     t ime  fig nature of folding endurance loss
 the library quarterly interested in durability not permanence research libraries are interested primarily in permanence or maintaining their collections over an indefinite period of time this discussion is directed toward the needs of the research library but the suggestions can be modified to suit libraries with less permanent collections books in research collections are likely to be exposed to all the causes of paper deterioration during their expected lifetime counter measures must be considered when a preservation program is established other papers in this issue report on the chemistry of paper deterioration and methods of environmental control   and i shall avoid these topics insofar as possible the impermanence of library materials is largely related to the degradation of cellulose in paper and other book components cellulose is a stable organic chemical and the major component of paper fibers the integrity of paper fibers and their resistance to deterioration vary widely with the composition and manufacture of the paper and the storage history of books the quality of paper fibers can deteriorate rapidly as a consequence of oxidative hydrolytic and photochemical reactions oxidative and hydrolytic attacks are particularly important oxidative degradation is both a direct and an indirect cause of paper impermanence oxidative reactions can cause an immediate scission of the cellulose molecule or prepare the way for other undesirable reactions oxidized cellulose is unstable and particularly liable to discoloration however the presence of oxygen is required for the production of oxidized cellulose and its formation normally proceeds very much more slowly than that of hydrolyzed cellulose the preservation of library materials is contingent on minimizing the rate of hydrolytic acidic attack the accepted preservation treatment for unstable book paper includes neutralization as well as the deposit of a benign alkaline buffering agent in the treated paper such a treatment does not however strengthen weakened or embrittled paper although an alkaline condition does restrict the activity of trace metals like copper and iron deacidification does not decrease the probability of biological attack because alkaline conditions favor the growth of many fungi and make books more appetizing to insects and rodents deacidification does not prevent oxidative or photochemical attack although the alkaline buffer neutralizes the acidic by products of these reactions these problems and other hazards to books must be considered when planning a complete preservation program a preservation program should make it reasonably certain that a library can discard only those materials which it no longer needs rather than be forced to discard materials because they have deteriorated beyond use with this general objective in mind i propose that a preservation program for a research library should include  a deacidification treatment benign to book and user which includes the deposit of an alkaline buffering agent and protection against biological attack  a strengthening and restoration treatment capable of improving the durability of heavily used materials and restoring the condition of borderline books so they can be rebound and circulated

 the library quarterly actions of amines and carbohydrates as well as the more ordinary causes of color reversion in paper some applications of amines and their derivatives in stabilizing paper were enumerated in a previous library quarterly article  p  in addition amines have been patented as vapor phase corrosion inhibitors in antitarnishing wrapping papers  and used to stabilize dark colored and black cellulosic plastic molded products  p  j t bent district sales manager plastics division eastman chemical products inc rochester ny personal correspondence amines are used to stabilize electrical papers against heat degradation   gaines  and volgenau  investigated the effect of gaseous liquid and solid amines on the thermal stability of cellulose they found that the amines which were effective in stabilizing the strength properties of paper also caused the paper to discolor langwell  p  asserted that the simplest organic alkali ammonia as an air pollutant is a cause of paper discoloration a thorough discussion of amines is beyond the scope of this paper but the langwell vapor phase deacidification vpd process   requires comment the need for comment exists because the data on which langwell   asserts the safety of his vpd process under library conditions is incomplete moreover some research applicable to the toxicology of the vpd process has not heretofore been discussed in library literature the langwell vpd process is similar to the use of moth balls where a solid material is placed close to the endangered goods and protection is conveyed via a vapor phase the solid agent in the vpd process is cyclohexylamine carbonate cyclohexanecarbamic acid cyclohexylammonium salt manufactured by bubbling carbon dioxide through cyclohexylamine under appropriate conditions the chemical reaction is shown by figure  cyclohexylamine carbonate is acidic rather than alkaline so it cannot be the deacidification agent on vaporizing therefore it may reasonably be assumed that a major portion of the solid agent must revert to the alkaline chemical cyclohexylamine consequently this discussion will focus on cyclohexylamine the deacidification agent in the vpd process research on cyclohexylamine is currently stimulated because some people produce it as a metabolic product of the cyclamate family of artificial sweeteners the us food and drug administration is concerned about the toxicity of cyclohexylamine and is developing information on the quantities of cyclach ch ch ch ch ch  cj h nh  co di ch ch nh co hn ch ch ch ch chch ch ch cyclohexylamine  carbon _ cyclohexylamine carbonate dioxide  fig formation of cyclohexylamie carbonate
new approaches to preservation  mates safe for human consumption in the process they may establish safe ingestion levels for cyclohexylamine the toxicology of cyclohexylamine has been reviewed  and small quantities have been found to be hazardous to health   the royal air force laboratories in porton england investigated the toxicity of cyclohexylamine carbonate in   the report of this investigation has been identified as the porton report and it has been cited as indicating that cyclohexylamine carbonate was safe for use in libraries   the porton report presented data obtained by short term and relatively gross tests to justify the use of cyclohexylamine carbonate for the vaporphase prevention of metal corrosion kenneth p dubois professor of pharmacology and director of the toxicity laboratory the university of chicago advised me that the porton report contained some evidence which suggests that an occasional and brief exposure to cyclohexylamine carbonate vapor would not be harmful he stated further that the report contained no iiformation to support the contention that humans could tolerate long term exposure to cyclohexylamine carbonate vapor the porton report included data which can be interpreted as showing the necessity for further investigation before the vpd process is widely applied in libraries it stated that the cyclohexylamine carbonate vapor concentration at  f  c would approach five to six grams per cubic meter under saturated conditions and ranged from one to two grams when fresh air was introduced the lowest vapor concentration reported was  grams per cubic meter that is about one part per thousand when trays containing cyclohexylamine carbonate were placed together with experimental animals in a static ten cubic meter test chamber in the vpd process for deacidifying books sheets of paper impregnated with cyclohexylamine carbonate are inserted at twenty five page intervals for books printed on heavily sized or coated papers and at fifty page intervals for books printed on porous papers   one publication  recommends the impregnated paper not extend beyond the pages of the books being treated another publication  recommends the impregnated paper be sized larger so it will extend beyond the pages of the books undergoing treatment the cyclohexylamine carbonate contained in or migrating to the periphery of the book or the protruding edge of the impregnated paper volatilizes into the surrounding air similarly to the volatilization of the cyclohexylamine carbonate placed on trays during the porton experiments the porton report does not specify the rate of air change during the twohour animal exposure experiments when the cyclohexylamine carbonate vapor concentration ranged between one and two grams per cubic meter of air consequently this data cannot be applied directly to library book stacks but can be used to establish a possible concentration of cyclohexylamine carbonate vapor air in low use areas like library book stacks that are air conditioned is typically recirculated three to four times per hour and changed completely once per hour in dynamic test chambers the conventional practice is to change the air once per minute so it is reasonable to assume that the unspecified rate of fresh air introduction in the porton experiment changed the air at least once per hour hence it is plausible that if many of the books in an air conditioned book stack were deacid
 the library quarterly ified according to the vpd process the book stack air would also contain about one gram of cyclohexylamine equivalent per cubic meter of air temperatures in american book stacks are customarily maintained about  f instead of at  f as in the porton experiments this higher temperature would favor a higher concentration of cyclohexylamine carbonate vapor in  after a variety of experiments including inhalation studies where exposures continued four hours per day over a five month period lemonova  recommended that the maximum concentration of cyclohexylamine in air not be allowed to exceed  grams per cubic meter that is about one part per million for comparison the longest exposure of the porton investigation lasted thirty hours six hours per day for five days accordingly this argument at least suggests the possibility that the langwell vpd process one part per thousand might expose library personnel to  times the maximum amount of cyclohexylamine lemonova concluded it was safe for russian factory workers to breathe it follows that before cyclohexylamine carbonate can be used without hesitation by librarians the safety of air borne concentrations of cyclohexylamine carbonate which actually occur under practical book stack conditions must be determined by appropriate inhalation studies in addition it would be desirable to establish the dissociation rate of cyclohexylamine carbonate into cyclohexylamine as this information does not appear to be available in the literature likewise the rates at which cyclohexylamine carbonate vapor evolves from treated books should be investigated both when the impregnated paper protrudes and when it does not protrude from the treated books more precise information should be developed on the rate of browning and the degree to which discoloration would affect legibility and colored illustrations such a study might also consider the problem of how frequently the cyclohexylamine carbonate lost by volatilization should be replaced to maintain the condition of alkalinity if the safety of the vpd process is assured under normal conditions librarians should consider that largescale applications would require the presence of substantial quantities of cyclohexylamine carbonate and that these quantities could become hazardous in case of fire ten grams of cyclohexylamine carbonate are recommended when deacidifying two pounds of loose papers contained in a closed box  more than  percent of the books in urban research libraries are in need of a deacidification treatment hence a  book library given that the average book weighed two pounds could contain about  grams or thirty three tons of cyclohexylamine carbonate cyclohexylamine carbonate like cyclohexylamine  p  would undoubtedly be classed as having dangerous properties  inorganic deacdification agents calcium and magnesium carbonates are stabilizing agents they are found in stable old papers and probably were introduced accidentally during the process of preparing the fibers or intentionally to cheapen and whiten the paper and improve its printability early papermakers probably used limestone and dolomite stone rolls and containers for fiber maceration hard water commonly used as the vehicle to work up i the figure of  percent is based on data from a study i am currently conducting at the newberry library chicago iii

new approaches to preservation  ful to paper pigments and the various media must be developed  p  in the following section i will review the literature pertaining to non aqueous deacidification treatments and then describe a novel method for meeting the specifications of this committee  nonaqueous deacidification nonaqueous deacidification treatments involve the use of a nonaqueous solution composed of a deacidification agent and an organic solvent the major advantage of using organic solvents is the possibility of treating whole books and therefore libraries organic solvents are available as liquids over a wide range of temperatures and they can be blended together to obtain specific working properties far less heat energy is required to dry organic solvents from paper because suitable solvents have much lower specific heats of vaporization than water does on the other hand certain organic solvents are poisonous or hazardous to health some organic solvents have flammable vapors that can burn with explosive speed the dyestuffs in some inks and paper are more or less soluble in organic solvents fat and other skin components can be dissolved and dermatitis problems can arise from prolonged contact with many organic solvents these hazards must be considered and safety measures incorporated when designing a nonaqueous deacidification treatment barrow recognized the possibility for improvement and described two attempts at nonaqueous deacidification  p  the first attempt using diglycolamine failed because the treated paper did not remain alkaline on accelerated aging the reacidification could have occurred because diglycolamine volatilized out of the paper or because the chemical reacted further with the cellulose to produce an acidic condition the second attempt used a solution of magnesium acetate dissolved in water and mechanically mixed with trichlorethylene the results presumably were erratic because magnesium acetate is not soluble in trichlorethylene and because water and trichlorethylene like water and oil are immiscible liquids langwell  p  reviewed nonaqueous systems concluded they had advantages over aqueous treatments but emphasized their lack of usefulness due to cost flammability and toxicity of the solvents baynes cope  has proposed the use of barium hydroxide a toxic chemical in methanol wood or methyl alcohol regrettably he found it necessary to limit this method to the deacidification of single documents in cases where aqueous solutions can not be used eg for water labile inks and vellum  pp   with this background we can define two requirements for an ideal nonaqueous deacidification treatment  the deacidification and alkaline buffering agent deposited in the treated papers should be a benign inorganic chemical demonstrably compatible with paper and books over long periods of time  the solvent for and the carrier of the deacidification agent should be benign to operators and to books under the conditions of treatment and easy to dry from the wetted books  theory of methodthe deacidification agent and the solvents used in the chicago process of deacidification meet these two ideal requirements this point will be expanded by first considering the deacidification agent and then discussing the solvent system many organic and inorganic chemicals are effective deacidification agents
 the library quarterly but both kinds of chemicals have limitations that work against their wide application the advantages of organic and inorganic chemicals are combined in certain metal organic compounds these compounds are partially organic and partially inorganic one kind of metal organic compounds is called alkoxides alkoxides are formed by the reaction of alcohols with many metals   alcohols react with metals and form their own families of alkoxides just as water forms hydroxides many alkoxides are soluble to some degree in their parent alcohol and other organic solvents one characteristic property of alkoxides is their inclination to react with water and form a hydroxide and the parent alcohol magnesium methoxide is an alkoxide which readily reacts with water it is commercially available and can be produced in the laboratory   solutions of magnesium methoxide in methanol are stable up to concentrations of  percent by weight and metastable from  to  percent nonaqueous deacidification treatments using magnesium methoxide introduce the same chemicals into paper as are found in stable papers produced in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries magnesium methoxide reacts immediately with moisture to form magnesium hydroxide magnesium hydroxide more familiarly called milk of magnesia has been known to improve the stability of acidic paper since   p  practically speaking there is no difference between the chemicals produced in paper by the gear  or the barrow laboratory  aqueous magnesium bicarbonate treatments and my nonaqueous magnesium methoxide deacidification treatment magnesium bicarbonate carbonate and hydroxide are not stable in paper the equilibrium compound is a complex mixture of these chemicals and water magnesium sulfate better known as epsom salts is a major reaction product on the neutralization of paper and its effects are not dangerous it may be concluded therefore that the equilibrium deacidification products that result from the introduction of magnesium methoxide meet or exceed the specified ideals there are other alkoxides that could be used for deacidification work but they will not be considered at this time the selection of a nonaqueous solvent system will be discussed next methanol has advantages as an alcohol because it is the smallest and most volatile of all alcohols unfortunately methanol has many of the undesirable properties of water in addition it is flammable and toxic and dissolves ink paper dyestuffs and pyroxylin on the other hand magnesium methoxide is soluble in methanol and the hazards of flammability toxicity and solubility can be circumvented the chlorofluorohydrocarbons are nontoxic and about as nonreactive as an organic material can be as liquefied gases they are used as foodstuff propellants and in refrigeration the bigger chemical relatives of these gases are liquids that retain these benign properties and are widely used for dry cleaning greasy dirt from delicate fabrics chlorofluorohydrocarbon solvents and methanol are completely soluble in one another and the hazards of methanol fall off as the proportion of methanol in the mixed solvent is reduced for example a solution containing seventyfive parts of a chlorofluorohydrocarbon solvent and twenty five parts of methfrom callery chemical co callery pennsylvania  morton chemical co  north wacker drive chicago illinois  and stauffer chemical co  madison avenue new york new york

 the library quarterly steps in the chicago process of deacidification for whole books the essential steps of the deacidification treatment proper are noted as well as the stages required to prepare reclaim make up and recycle the deacidification solution there has been no experimental work on reclaiming the solution but there are no foreseeable difficulties in cleaning and recycling it the importance of recycling the solution cannot be underestimated because the low cost per unit concept of the chicago process requires an efficient recovery system the following experiments and data speak to the commercial and technical feasibility of deacidifying whole books three copies of cooking the greek way by maro duncan london spring books  printed in czechoslovakia were placed standing top down in an autoclave made from eight inchdiameter pressure pipe and flanges a cotton wrapping cord was placed between the fly and text leaves close to the spine otherwise the books were kept closed the books were set upon onequarter inch glass tubing to facilitate drainage on emptying the autoclave the autoclave was sealed immersed in boiling water and the books were vacuum dried for four hours at about five millimeters of mercury then the autoclave was removed from the boiling water and allowed to cool overnight the next day the deacidification solution was prepared in a ten pound propane bottle first  cubic centimeters of a  percent solution of magnesium methoxide in methanol were syphoned into the bottle then the solution was diluted with ten pounds of chlorodifluoromethane freon  a liquefied refrrigeration gas the liquefied gas flows into the propane bottle more rapidly when the pressure in the propane bottle is substantially lower than the pressure in the refrigeration gas bottle there was no suitable pump available so the pressure differential was obtained through cooling the propane bottle by placing dry ice around it a similar situation existed between the propane bottle and the autoclave consequently the autoclave was cooled by packing it in dry ice and insulating it with a polyurethane foam pad and cotton toweling the cooling caused a substantial pressure differential and the deacidification solution flowed rapidly into the autoclave through its lower inlet this sudden cooling when the deacidification solution entered the autoclave was a good practical check on its stability the next step was to warm the deacidification solution and books by immersing the autoclave in hot water this warming served two purposes    the increase in temperature introduced enough heat energy for the book to dry itself and  the higher pressure insured impregnation by the deacidification solution throughout the book the pressure in the autoclave rose rapidly to about  pounds per square inch psi the bath water temperature was reduced to  f to give an autoclave pressure of about  psi after one hour of immersion the autoclave was removed from the water bath the deacidification solution was blown out of the autoclave through the lower outlet on the vessel and discarded the top outlet was opened when only gas was exhausting from the lower outlet about ten to fifteen minutes after opening the first valve the autoclave lid was removed and the books were found to be substantially dry in a second test three copies of cooking the greek way were placed in the autoclave as above this time however the adsorbed water was not removed from the books by drying in
new approaches to preservation  this second test the autoclave was packed in dry ice and the adsorbed water was frozen the preparation and charging of the deacidification solution was accomplished as in the above test except that twelve pounds of dichlorodifluoromethane freon  was substituted for the chlorodifluoromethane the deacidification solution and the books were warmed by squirting the autoclave first with cold and then with hot water the pressure was about  psi and the temperature was about  f one hour after charging the deacidification solution the autoclave was emptied and opened as before and the books again were found to be substantially dry before discussing the results it is appropriate to consider why cooking the greek way was selected for experimentation the book was the right size for the autoclave available in quantity and inexpensive as a remnant and it contained colored materials that were soluble in the solvents i wanted to use these colored materials included blue dyestuffs in the paper in the stain on the head margin and in the printing ink as well as a yellow brown material in the binding presumably the softener in the binding adhesive moreover the paper was uncoated and had a fiber content of about  percent groundwood and  percent softwood sulfite the quantity of deacidification solution charged into the autoclave was controlled to fill the autoclave about half the height of the books undergoing treatment wetting the books halfway up is more informative than complete immersion first the liquid gas interface is the point where the solvent is most likely to attack the book and second i wanted to know the degree to which the solution would wick up the leaves the drying under high vacuum caused some of the boards to warp but the freezing appeared to have no effect the drying action did not appear to embrittle the paper or otherwise work against its usability the bowed boards straightened within a few days as they regained moisture from the air the milk of magnesia powder was more tightly bound in the dried copy than in the frozen copy the dried book had only a small quantity of powder deposited on its binding considerably more was deposited on the binding of the frozen copy a cloud of powder came from the frozen books if they were opened and smartly clapped shut no powder came from the dried book under similar conditions there was little if any noticeable difference between the immersed and unimmersed portions of the leaves and no trace of the liquidgas interface line the spines were straight and the apparent loss of title legibility could easily be fixed with a thin coating of lacquer or varnish i believe that the bibliographic data on library books would be more legible and more durable after experiencing the chicago process than before the books were standing in the autoclave top edge down in the deacidification solution some of the stain on the top edge was dissolved there appeared to be no damage at the spine and no sign of any dissolved adhesives etc the back cover of the dried books did exhibit several faint yellowish marks and one book had a light bluish streak on the endpaper the books were a little bulkier after treatment than before but this effect disappeared a day or so after the books were placed back on the shelves the dyestuffs in the ink exhibited themselves as strike through in other words the impression to the reader would be that the paper had less ability to hide the type face images on the
 the library quarterly verso of the pages many ordinary books exhibit a greater degree of strikethrough than i produced in cooking the greek way there was some staining on a few leaves of the books but it did not appear to be of a serious nature my belief is that practically all library books could be deacidified in a pressure system and that the ordinary reader or librarian would be unable to tell they had been treated in the other instances i do not believe the usefulness of the book as an information source would be impaired it is remarkable that a book composed of materials like those in cooking the greek way was treated as has been described and that for practical library purposes no damage occurred the contact ph values at various positions on page  of an untreated copy of cooking the greek way are compared in table  with ph values for identical positions in randomly selected copies of a dried and a frozen book from the preceding tests the contact method of measuring ph is reviewed elsewhere  pp   and has been found to give ph values comparable  with those obtained by the tappi cold extraction test  the locations where measurements were made are described in table  the ph values for the paper in the untreated copy were  or  and indicate the paper would be impermanent the top halves of the other two books were immersed during the treatments the ph values for the immersed portion of the dried copy were   and  at the margin of the nonimmersed end values were  and  the contact ph values for the frozen copy were   and  in the immersed portion and  and  at the margins of the nonimmersed end the fact that some of the deacidification solution traveled vertically up the leaves by capillary action is important this travel or wicking action verifies the stability and workability of the solution and together with the pressures of impregnation guarantees that the treatment solution reached the innermost parts of the book figure  presents the results of an accelerated aging study on the stabilizing effect of these deacidification treatments the same leaves from all three books were aged according to the tappi standard test  and the change in mit folding endurance value  was observed for the immersed portions of these leaves both deacidification treatments were effective in promoting the permanence of the treated books however the data are insufficient to decide whether the drying or the freezing table  contact ph values for page  from treated and untreated copies of cooking the greek way dried and frozen and contact ph value at position unoptrted deacidified deacidified coy copy copy in top margin at center of page     near fore edge margin halfway down page      near spine halfway down page     near fore edge margin at tail of page      near spine at tail of page    
new approaches to preservation  method of removing moisture is preferable i believe the more economic of the two methods should be selected but do not have sufficient data on which to make a decision at this time deacidification is the basic tool of preservation work but a deacidification treatment is no panacea a more complete preservation program can justifiably be considered once deacidification is accomplished in addition to nonaqueous deacidification the chicago process will consider protection against living organisms paper strengthening and prolonged storage  protection from living organisms the possibility of paper being attacked by living organisms increases as an acidic paper becomes moderately alkaline a majority of fungi insects and rodents prefer to eat neutral or moderately alkaline paper one consequence of book deacidification if poor storage conditions exist is the increased probability of attack by living organisms protection against such attacks can be obtained simply and at practically no expense a biostat or biocide can be deposited during the deacidification treatment commercially available mercuric and tin antibiological agents are soluble in organic solvents compatible with alkoxides benign at the required levels of dosage and presumably effective for many years the costs would be limited to the chemical itself and to the expense of maintaining the proper dosage level in the deacidification solution two sets of books were prepared for exposure one set used fifteen copies of the book entitled the italian girl and the other used thirteen copies of the    c c_  o  frozen and cn dcleacidif ied d  i  n o  e ln   _i     _ dried   an a oigeffectof deacidifiido e   untreated     d  z oh   l     days of heat aging at  c fig effect of deacidification on the folding endurance of leaves from cooking the greek way

 the library quarterly design a pilot apparatus similar to that which might be used in a library in order to develop information on  effectiveness of various solvent systems  optimum time of treatment  cost per unit of deacidified material  effect of solvents on various materials used in books and  methods for recovering and recycling solvents the design construction and testing of a pilot apparatus is not a small task it is difficult to set precise time limits on this kind of investigation because all of the problems cannot be anticipated and smith will probably want to evaluate a variety of treatment procedures a nonaqueous pressure system should be useful for the massproduction deacidification of archival and library materials i should like to offer the following as opinions  any problems that might occur should develop from the solvent and not from the magnesium methoxide the latter would end up as magnesium carbonate in the paper some of the same types of solvents that smith used are recommended for cleaning of documents  any difficulties would be likely to occur immediately and not a year or more later  many sizing materials would be soluble  a water deacidification method might be preferable in those cases where the paper must be wet anyway for cleaning bleaching or repair  although i feel that moisture should play a greater part in a laboratory aging method for paper it is very unlikely that the use of a method involving moisture would have resulted in different conclusions smith used a standard method and indeed he would be open to criticism if he had not  humidity cycling  percent  percent and then  percent relative humidity is a preferred procedure prior to physical testing smith has utilized this technique in his more rigorous work smith study of aqueous deacidification methods is timely and i hope this work will be pursued most procedures i believe consume entirely too much time some data obtained about two years ago indicate that a major part of the pick up of magnesium bicarbonate occurs in the first five minutes if this is true for most papers soaking time could be drastically reduced this may be academic as the time of soaking may not be the ratedetermining step in the procedure as part of the overall study boundary conditions and preferred procedures should be worked out for all methods of deacidification much of this information is available and waiting to be assembled smith has found differences in performance of several of the deacidified papers with time of aging although these differences are real i doubt if they are significant i should prefer to lump the deacidified papers together and conclude that in the absence of an exhaustive study of deacidification methods all of them appear to serve the purpose the variables are endless and we do not have all of the information smith would have a more dramatic story to tell if he had used papers that were more acidic he proved his point but made his task a little more difficult presumably it will be desirable to dry paper to a low moisture content prior to nonaqueous deacidification paper is more susceptible to damage
new approaches to preservation  from handling at low moisture contents because it is less flexible this is a matter of degree rather than kind but paper that already is weak must be handled very carefully during aqueous deacidification the wetted paper retains only a small fraction of its dry strength and is even more susceptible to damage from handling the heats of vaporization of the chlorofluorohydrocarbon solvents are low enough that their removal from paper should be easy and economical the heat of vaporization of water is almost  calories per gram  megajoules per kilogram methyl alcohol requires   calories per gram  megajoules per kilogram and the chlorofluorohydrocarbon solvents range from thirty five to fifty six calories per gram   megajoules now i should like to leave smith paper and make a few remarks concerning research on preservation of records in general the first point i wish to emphasize is that we really do not understand everything that happens when a sheet of paper deteriorates some of the possibilities have been discussed by luner  the second point is that the evaluation of materials and processes should be done on a continuing basis new materials and new processes are constantly appearing on the market a prime example is the revolution that has occurred in the past twenty years or even in the past ten years in office copying machines the third point is that cooperation is needed among manufacturers research laboratories libraries printers and publishers an excellent example of informal cooperation is smith work the university of chicago the institute of paper chemistry the council on library resources inc and the chicago testing laboratory as well as industry and overseas institutions have contributed to his research the fourth point is that specifications for stable papers are needed manufacturers and consumers with specifications can communicate in quantitative language now i should like to make a few comments concerning accelerated or laboratory aging laboratory aging represents a compromise and we should never expect the full story from any accelerated aging procedure however this is the only practical approach to evaluating the relative stability of various materials how does one select samples of paper for aging studies it one writes down all of the variables a program of such magnitude emerges that it would require a staff of ten people working for the next ten years in the meantime newer materials would be on the market and modifications in the manufacture of the papers being studied might have occurred smith mentioned that laboratory aging had indicated that sodium bicarbonate was not a good material for deacidification he also pointed out that sodium bicarbonate apparently had come into contact with cloth in which some mummies were wrapped and after several thousand years this cloth was still in excellent condition this is an example of a material that performed well in normal aging but not in accelerated aging situations like this call for the utmost in knowledge and judgement in order to avoid errors laboratory aging methods must be developed to suit the material several
