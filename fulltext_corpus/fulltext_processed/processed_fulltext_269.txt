 the library quarterly nelia decided that traveling libraries were the answer for the  cities of   the  cities of under  and at least  rural communities her arguments were calculated to appeal to the critical and somewhat hostile legislature the most economical and satisfactory method of giving library opportunities to country people and of supplying books for small communities is to have a state center from which libraries may be sent to these communities and exchanged at frequent intervals for other sections of the state lending library a library which is always in use and in which there is no waste material and no storing up of books for occasional reference    the central administration is much more efficient and economical than local administration could be each collection of books is always in use and each station has the benefit of all the books owned by the state this appeal influenced the legislature to increase her appropriation and stimulated contributions by several publicspirited citizens applications for libraries poured in from all over the state the books in these traveling libraries were carefully chosen to appeal to as many readers as possible over the sixmonth period the library remained in a convenient public place each collection of fifty volumes was approximately half fiction and contained some poetry travel biography and history with a few practical books on such subjects as agriculture dressmaking cooking mechanics and woodworking most of the libraries contained groups of books upon special subjects for the encouragement of serious reading and some material on current public questions it was hoped that the fictioninteresting wholesome stories which will provide the best sort of recreation and moral influence would attract those who had not yet acquired the habit of reading once the individual was interested he could be expected to progress naturally from fiction to biography on to history and finally into economics and political studies cornelia noted with satisfaction that the reading in traveling library communities would be of a higher quality than that in the ordinary city library where people had a greater number of books to choose from cornelia discouraged by the number of requests for more popular books later confessed that the libraries had apparently been too heavy although she recognized the importance of reading as good wholesome recreation she regretted the development of the library as a recreational facility rather than an educational institution cornelia drove the oregon library commission and the state toward the achievement of the goal of the best books to the greatest number at the least cost at the end of its first year of work the commission with its meager legislative appropriation supplemented by gifts had supplied forty five rural communities and small cities in oregon with traveling libraries circulating about  volumes the commission had compiled and published a list of books for school libraries and saved the state over  by acting as the agent for purchasing books for all the school districts as a side effect raising the quality of the books secured cornelia by liberally interpreting the duties of the commission had already begun legislative reference work in the summer of  she conducted a fouribid pp  l  ibid p  ibid p   johansen op cit see n  above pp    cornelia adopted this slogan as the motto of the oregon state library

cornelia marvin pierce  proficient in the various technical activities in order to devote a larger portion of her time to the important duties of selecting books and guiding readers as far as oregon librarians were concerned cornelia automatically expected that they would be among the most progressive members of their community and willing to assume a position of leadership on various issues in  for example she sent a letter to all oregon librarians requesting them to obtain signatures for an initiative petition for a bill to abolish capital punishment i have been personally interested in this step in the civilization of oregon and feel that all the librarians are equally interested   i am hoping that each oregon librarian may return the petition with at least one hundred names on it in her own library she selected intelligent well trained young women with interest in public affairs and a background in economics and political science she always preferred women to men in the profession i do not believe in making a sex question but i do believe that the library women are generally very much more competent and intelligent and instructive than the library men    women have generally made our profession unfortunately there were relatively few librarians who met these specifications and who were willing to devote themselves to tiny salaries and limited horizons in the small public libraries the scarcity of such people to staff these libraries was one of the major factors which turned cornelia against such institutions in wisconsin all our field work for many years i thought was a failure because we were trying to educate and stimulate a constantly moving procession of inferior librarians in little towns cornelia who had never believed in the motto not the few great libraries but the many small ones advocated that the small library unit be abolished entirely as she wrote the editor of public libraries in  i am quite convinced that the library in the village or small town is a very unsatisfactory institution which gives ordinarily very poor results for the money invested    when i suggested at the library commission meeting two years ago that i thought it unwise to encourage the establishment of small libraries i was pounced on by all the library enthusiasts it is our settled policy in oregon    to encourage the establishment of central county libraries which will reach all of the small towns with branches and stations giving efficient service and a good book supply through this wider cooperation    i am inclined to think that with all our talk about what public libraries can do and what they mean is not much to the purpose unless they are administered by competent people and have splendid collections of books the small library as she described it has poor service few books requires a large rate of tax levy and accumulates a dead stock which duplicates the dead stock on the shelves of all the neighboring towns oregon was one of the first states to provide for county support of library service and after several legislative attempts cornelia felt that they had in  achieved a model law ironically although wisconsin minnesota and oregon pioneered in the countylibrary field between  and   cornelia marvin to oregon librarians may  c m pierce papers  cornelia marvin to beatrice winser april   c m pierce papers  cornelia marvin to c c williamson april   c m pierce papers  cornelia marvin to m e ahern may   c m pierce papers  biennial report     see n  above p
