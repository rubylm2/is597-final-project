teens technology and libraries an uncertain relationship denise e agosto rachel m magee michael dickard and andrea forte abstract a growing body of research examines teens use of digital technologies to meet their academic and personal information needs but few studies have considered how public and school libraries fit into modern teens information practices this study uses data from surveys of and interviews with  teens enrolled in a highly technological urban us high school to consider how the prevalence of technology in their daily lives has influenced their perceptions and use of libraries the results indicated that this group of students tended to think of libraries as largely outdated institutions with little connection to their technology focused daily information practices thus libraries might better serve teens with high levels of technology access by reframing their services in terms of promoting social interaction and community building as well as focusing less on providing materials and technology access and more on teaching how to search and evaluate information housed outside of libraries physical and virtual boundaries w hile researchers increasingly challenge the idea that all teens exhibit advancedtechnology knowledge and skills eg agosto and abbas  jones and czer niewicz  bayne and ross  recent figures from the pew research center madden et al  indicate that computer use among us teens is nearly ubiquitous with  owning a computer or having access to one at home these figures also reveal that internet enabled cell phones are often the first choice access method for us teens  of whom have a cell phone and  of whom have a smart phone our own work forte et al  has found that us teens are active users of social media for answering and asking questions of their peers and others turning to different online communities to reach different audiences based on the types of information needed or being distributed one area that remains largely unexplored is the role of public and school libraries in this technology heavy environment this article considers how the prevalence of technology in teens daily lives influences their perceptions and uses of libraries this project was funded by the institute of museum and library services award lg     library quarterly information community policy vol  no  pp    by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
teens technology and libraries   problem statement and research questions a large body of research spanning multiple domains and disciplines investigates teens technology use such as how they use technology in school settings eg cepni tas and kose  lim et al  technology use attitudes eg robertson et al  tsai and tsai  zhua chen chen and chern  and cyberbullying sexting and other risky online behaviors eg parris et al  livingstone and gorzig  but little work has examined the extent to which teens are integrating libraries into their technology use patterns a clearer understanding of teens perceptions of libraries and their library use patterns would enable librarians to design programs and services that better support and enhance teens digital information behaviors within the library and information science lis community there has been a heavy focus on research conducted from an adult centered perspectivework that privileges librarians and other adults prescriptive ideals about how young people should use technology analog information resources and more broadly library services and resources agosto  this study is part of a larger project investigating how teens engage in social search practices online and how they use social technologies in their daily lives we take a youth centered approach in our work to better understand teens technological behaviors and preferences and how they intersect with their perceptions and use of public and school libraries focusing not on how youth should use technology and libraries but on how they do use them teens information practices are tightly connected with their social and community relationships eg boyd  many of these practices are increasingly mediated through social mediasocial technologies as evidenced by behaviors such as online question asking and answering understanding how libraries fit into these information practices is an important part of understanding the complete information ecologies of todays teens against this changing technology backdrop we addressed the following research questions  what are teens attitudes and perceptions of libraries in this new information ecology  how has technology influenced teens use or nonuse of libraries  what barriers exist that prevent todays teens from taking full advantage of library resources and services literature review research into teens use of digital information technology has been conducted primarily outside the traditional boundaries of lis to enable lis researchers and practitioners to better understand the connections between the study of teens digital information behaviors and practices and their perceptions and use of libraries this article reviews research across several domains and disciplines including lis humancomputer interaction and other areas

  the library quarterly continuums of inclusion related to teens use of social technology is the concept of digital inclusion sonia livingstone and ellen helsper  argued for a shift in focus from the digital divide to a continuum of inclusion building on mark warschauers  call for technology for social inclusion and other work examining differences in technology use including that of paul foley ximena alfonso karl brown and john fisher  eszter hargittai  and graham murdock  these studies demonstrate that effective inclusion entails not just access but social and cultural support higher level engagement and progression in experience with digital technologies we examine teen library use with a similar stance by considering not just access but the social relationships and contextual factors that inform library use method to examine these questions we conducted written surveys and individual interviews with  high school students during april and may  we recruited study participants on a volunteer basis at a competitive entry urban magnet public school the school has a curricular focus on science technology mathematics and entrepreneurship there were  students enrolled for the  academic year about  came from economically disadvantaged families and about  were minorities we chose this school for gathering a purposive sample of teens likely to be technology leaders among their generation with easy access to a wide variety of technologies and with well developed technology practices in order to understand their attitudes toward and relationships with libraries after completing consent and assent procedures students completed online surveys and took part in interviews participants were recruited on a volunteer basis via an informational session during a school assembly and informational sessions in homeroom classes during which we explained the study and asked for volunteers each student who took part in the study was paid a total of  for completing a survey and an interview the surveys asked for background information including age grade in school frequency of computer use and online question asking and answering behaviors for a more detailed explanation of the survey design see forte et al  although informed by the survey responses this article focuses on analyzing the individual interview data because only the individual interviews were designed to investigate participants uses and perceptions of libraries a total of  students completed surveys and individual interviews see table  for demographic snapshots of the study participants roughly one third were male and two thirds were female participants ranged in age from  to  with the largest percentage  in the age  group students age  or older did not need parental consent to participate so they were able to complete consent procedures more rapidly than minors resulting in more  year olds taking part in the study participants reported generally high levels of parental

  the library quarterly serve as a useful proxy for peoples actual online abilities in searching for information hargittai and hsieh  the web use skills items have been used in many studies and have consistently shown high internal consistency across data sets hargittai and hsieh  our data also exhibit excellent internal consistency with a cronbachs alpha of  our participants evidenced diverse web use skill levels ranging from  to  with a mean score of  and a standard deviation of  comparing the average web use skills of our sample to those reviewed by hargittai and hsieh in which average scores ranged from  to we find that the teens in our sample averaged slightly higher thanaverage skill levels which makes sense since they were enrolled in a technology focused school it is important to note that although the school had a physical space that housed a library collection at the time of the study there was no librarian on staff the seniors in our study were the only students who had had a librarian on staff during their high school years the school librarian position had been cut due to budget issues after their freshman year the circulating collection was still in use but without a librarian on staff to oversee the library program unfortunately this lack of staffing reflects the current status of many urban school libraries in its  report on urban schools the american association of school librarians found that only  of respondents indicated that their school libraries are staffed by one or more full time professionally credentialed librarians american association of school librarians  in many us school districtsespecially in urban areasattending a school without a librarian on staff is more common than attending a school with an employed librarian the majority of the school based research investigating students perceptions and use of libraries has been conducted in schools staffed with librarians however the opinions and behaviors of students in understaffed schools are equally valid and merit study these students also have valuable opinions and perceptions of libraries as a field we want to study them and serve their needs too although the culture and context of this school are unique the findings from our work there can inform research and practice for others interested in understanding high school students perceptions of public and school libraries especially given the reality of current tight funding and staffing for many libraries endeavoring to serve teens data analysis the survey and interview guide were based on a review of the teens and social technology literatures and on the  everyday life information needs categories presented in denise agosto and sandra hughes hassell  the interview questions asked participants about their use of social media and other technologies their favorite activities online their online question asking and answering experiences their social media interactions with teachers
teens technology and libraries   and school administrators and their use of school and public libraries specifically we asked participants to tell us about the last time they had used a library allowing them to define library use for themselves we then used probe questions to learn more about their experiences each interview lasted roughly half an hour together the interviews totaled more than  hours of audio recordings the written transcripts totaled  pages of raw data or more than  words we used qualitative content analysis a common method for coding qualitative interview transcripts to analyze the data wildemuth  qualitative content analysis enables the interpretation of textual data through the systematic coding and identification of significant themes hsieh and shannon  we used inductive category development mayring  to analyze the transcripts with the individual theme as the unit of analysis inductive category development uses the research questions as a starting place for developing the coding scheme the researchers first divide the research questions into abstract categories and then conduct iterative rounds of coding refining the categories with each round depending on the size of the body of data the researchers usually conduct initial rounds of coding and category development with  of the data after a coding scheme that fits that portion of the data is developed the researchers then return to the full body of data for additional rounds of coding refining the coding scheme to ensure a fit to the full body of data the main idea of the procedure is to formulate a criterion of definition derived from the theoretical background and research questions which determines the aspects of the textual material taken into account following this criterion the material is worked through and categories are tentatively and step by step deduced within a feedback loop those categories are revised eventually reduced to main categories and checked in respect to their reliability mayring  par  this approach is similar to hsieh and shannons  process of conventional qualitative content analysis in which categories are derived during the iterative data analysis process however philipp mayrings  inductive category development enables researchers to begin category derivation with the concepts embedded in the research questions providing direction and increasing the likelihood of conceptual relevance of the coding scheme in this case inductive category development enabled us to focus data analysis on understanding the participants perceptions and use of public and school libraries the final coding scheme is summarized as follows reasons for library nonuse  library equals books  inadequate resources  libraries are obsolete  uninviting atmospheres and staffs

teens technology and libraries   library as a place to eat lunch or to spend open periods and free time and part of the library had been turned into a makeshift music room a number of additional factors contributed to their infrequent library use including negative perceptions of libraries both public and school policy barriers knowledge barriers resource inadequacies access barriers and a preference for technology on the other hand some of the students did use libraries more frequently than others they identified several factors motivating their use including social interaction leisure opportunities book availability and reading and schoolwork space reasons for nonuse of libraries when discussing libraries the participants overwhelmingly focused on books as the core product or service for both public and school libraries this is not surprising as the vast majority of the us public tends to think of libraries mainly as book providers de rosa et al  fully three quarters of the participants  or  expressed the idea that library equals books this limited perception meant they would mainly think to use a library when looking for a paper book not for socializing or for entertainment opportunities or to take advantage of the many other services libraries offer and since most of the participants expressed a preference for technology over paper books they tended to view technology as more appealing than libraries as one of the  year old girls said she didnt use libraries because im not a book person similarly the next most commonly discussed reason for limited library use was the perception that libraries had inadequate resourcesa reason discussed by slightly over half of the students  or  part of this perception likely stemmed from the schools lack of a school librarian and consequent lack of conscious materials collection the school library doesnt really have books that you can use in class    there are a few language books and there are a few cookbooks because we have our laptops    the books are mostly there for entertainment female age  however the public library received similar criticism despite ongoing collection building and maintenance the public library near my house isnt very good it doesnt have a wide selection of books that i like to read so typically if i want to read a book i either already have it i buy it off amazon or i have to go to a different library further away from me female age  in addition   of the participants held the view that in todays technology driven society libraries are obsolete they felt that rather than being complementary libraries and technology were in competition for their time and interest and the internet and online content providers such as itunes have made libraries an artifact of the past with nearly ubiquitous connectivity at home school and elsewhere and with portable technologies such as cell phones and mp players nearly always at hand they felt no need to go to libraries for
  the library quarterly technology access these students also tended to view technology as easier and quicker to use than libraries as one of the boys explained because everyone is so tech based it is kind of pointless to go into the library anymore age  the first three categories of reasons for nonuse all address library resources the next category reflects about a quarter of the students  or  perceptions of libraries as having uninviting atmospheres and staffs several students recounted past negative experiences with librarians and other staff which led them to develop unpleasant associations with libraries for example one of the senior year students critiqued both the inconsistent staffing of the school library and inconsistent rules for use of the space the first year the librarian ran it differently than the second year and then she left the third year we didnt have anyone so it was even more of a hangout spot then the next year we got a new librarian that was like no food no drinks no talking people were no longer interested in going there female age  this negative association with library employees and environments extended to public libraries as well for instance one of the boys felt uncomfortable going to the public library because of the restrictive rules i wouldnt do anything that would distract others not because im a nice person but i am totally anticonfrontational so if library staff got mad at me i wouldnt even know what to do i would be like im sorry man please please male age  reasons for library use still perceptions of libraries were not entirely negative the most frequently stated reason for library use was social interaction cited by  students or  this included hanging out socializing and eating in library spaces which was particularly common in the school library nine participants  also discussed using libraries for leisure opportunities including using public and school libraries to get books for leisure reading and as a space for leisure reading using the public library for checking out leisure music and attending planned library programs such as movies and games for example one of the girls explained that the last time she had gone to the public library was last tuesday but that was actually the first time in years that i went i actually went there because my friend needed a book for his class and he was going to get a library card and he wanted me to come he had money but he owed more in fines so i allowed him to use my card and we actually ended up staying because it had this program going on in the back and they told us if we stayed there was going to be food so we stayed and played some games    we learned that they have these things every tuesday these teen programs that they have and all these teens from different
teens technology and libraries   places come and meet and they play all these games and eat and just hang out it was really fun we actually started going on tuesdays because it was really fun    we were making poems out of the titles of the books it was really fun we played dance dance revolution and they do things like karaoke age  other students had used their public libraries for schoolwork space and resources it started out as part of an english assignment that we were doing an independent reading so you could do an author study or a genre study and i chose an author study so my english teacher had two of the books i wanted to read but there were two more that i didnt have and nobody that i could find in the school had them and our school library didnt have them so we took a school trip to the library and i was like oh wait i have a library card but its like from when i was in fifth grade    so i got my library card renewed and now ive been back a bunch of times since then because it was such a great experience i was like hey the library is quiet theres everything i need i forgot what a good source it was    yeah it was like hey the librarys kind of awesome female age  for some students library materials were the draw but for others the physical building itself was the attraction i go to the library not really because its in the library but i can finish my work just because there is not a lot of people in there that really has nothing to do with it being the library itself  male age  although the professional library literature often emphasizes the role of technology access for teens only   of the  participants discussed having used libraries for this purpose one had used the public library when her personal technology had malfunctioned i think the last time i used the public library was when i ran out of ink in my printer female age  the others tended to dismiss library technology as unnecessary due to the ubiquity of devices and access in their lives i have wi fi at my house so its not like i need to go somewhere to get connected to the internet female  finally under reasons for library use  participants  identified their public libraries as places for personal development or for self improvement and to fulfill volunteering requirements for school a common theme running through the interviews and reflected in several of the categories for library use and nonuse was the influence of technology on library use nine of the participants  explained that ubiquitous access reduced their need to use libraries for example i never use the library that often because i have mostly everything at home and i have a whole bunch of like devices    if the one thing dont work such as my laptop i have a desktop my grandma has a laptop then i have game systems that are connected to the internet and i have a lot of them so i really dont need to go to the library because i have everything at home female age 
  the library quarterly the convenienceaccessibility of technology was also attributed to reduced library use  participants or  these students felt that accessing information resources at home via digital devices was more comfortable and more convenient than going to a library the perception of access to any desirable resources comfortably at my home female age  was repeated throughout the interviews in addition changing perceptions of books and technology contributed to reduced library use noted by  participants  students tended to equate libraries with paper books and leisure reading and digital device use with schoolwork and information searching preferences for paper books or e books for leisure reading varied with some students feeling that paper books provided fewer distractions than reading on digital devices and others suggesting that the current availability of free online books meant no need for libraries for example when i was a freshman and my mom was really into me reading and stuff i used to visit the public library to get books but then it just faded away i usually just read stuff online now i have a google books account now that i read im reading the three musketeers now mostly because its free its one of those preloaded books that im reading now they have such a vast collection and they are relatively inexpensive to get a book online there are so many apps that give you free books now traveling to the library and doing that whole process of signing it out and have to return it its just more convenient to just read on your phone you dont have to carry a book around with you all the time male age  in contrast another student expressed a different point of view i feel like its better to have the hard copy of a book than the online version of it because im more into actually reading and im focused on that instead of having a laptop where i can go anywhere i want i just stay away from that and actually read female age  the participants expressed more uniform opinions about the relative ease of use of paper and digital resources all  participants  who made comparisons agreed that digital resources are easier to use than paper books they explained that google and the web are easier to use for school research than school library databases that e books are quicker and easier to access than paper books and that paper books are generally harder to use due to teens greater familiarity with digital formats barriers to library use nearly one third of the participants  or  discussed policy barriers including fines due dates public library noise restrictions time limits for the use of public library computers and high noise levels in the school library materials use policies were also seen as deterrents to library use i used to use the public library what ended up happening was
teens technology and libraries   a thirty dollar fine for a video that i didnt even check out so i never ended up going back and finding out how to solve the problem female age  about a quarter of the teens  or  also identified knowledge barriers as deterrents to library use including lack of knowledge of how libraries operate how library collections are organized and how to use paper books for example i took statistics class last year and i needed to have a textbook but instead of actually going to get the textbook i ended up finding it online and downloading it and just using my computer they gave me a textbook but i didnt know how to use it i couldnt understand how to use the textbook anymore because its been so long female age  access barriers also proved problematic for  students  they expressed a sense of difficulty getting to the public library and a perceived lack of organization of the school library collection as one of the girls explained i love readingbig book nerd ive taken several books from our school library and i used to have a library card for the public library around my way and i used to take books all the time but recently since i got into high school its harder for me to touch base with the library just because sometimes its out of the way female age  discussion looking more broadly at the categories in the coding scheme together they add up to a widely held perception that libraries represent an outdated past whereas technology represents these teens everyday reality few saw libraries as relevant to their daily lives yet most saw technology as relevant this is likely due in part to the fact that they were attending a technology focused school and had self selected as being interested in technology the lack of a school librarian for the past three years was also likely a contributor still the point to be learned here is that libraries have not successfully marketed their relevance to this group of teens although public libraries often try to market themselves as places to turn for technology access eg chapman  these teens views of libraries as competing with technology seems to diminish the likely effectiveness of such campaigns recent work examining technology access and use has complicated the idea that access is the most important factor in ones ability to capably use digital technology neil selwyn  has highlighted the importance of agency as a factor demonstrating that for some people nonuse of technology is a personal choice and that use can occur through proxy users who interact with technologies such as computers and the internet on their behalf eszter hargittai  has found that for young adults early in their college careers there are important differences in the level of web know how  using the internet that are correlated to socioeconomic status gender and race and ethnicity she found that individuals from lower income backgrounds women and hispanic and african americans demonstrate lower levels of internet skills these
  the library quarterly works join a growing body of critiques that take down traditional understandings of the digital divide eg van dijk and hacker  selwyn  agosto et al  and stress that personal background experiences knowledge and choice are all important factors when trying to understand technology use practices these ideas may be analogous to our understandings of teens use of libraries while access is an important factor to consider including physical distance from libraries as well as factors such as open hours and the climate of youth spaces in buildings access alone does not solve the issue of promoting and supporting library use taking factors such as agency proxy use background and skill levels into account may help to overcome nonuse and low levels of use of libraries and their services this is not to suggest that libraries play no roles in these teens lives on the contrary all  participantseven those who characterized themselves as current nonusershad used libraries in the past at least once thus this study shows the importance of thinking about library use and nonuse not as binary but as a continuum of use as is the case with technology use in fact several library use patterns were present within the data set about one quarter of the participants  or  identified themselves as having been frequent public library users as children but current nonusers they explained that as preteens or teens they had stopped using public libraries because their parents or guardians had stopped taking them they had less free time or both on the other hand two students  had recently rediscovered and become enthusiastic supporters of the public library after having been infrequent users for years showing the potential effectiveness of reintroducing teens to libraries and library services also notable were social factors motivating use one fifth of the participants  or  explained that they would only go to their public library to accompany a friend or family member or that they would only do schoolwork or hang out in the school library if friends or project collaborators were there this is an important finding because there is a shortage of public spaces where teens can meet and interact owens  and it offers a potentially fruitful avenue for making libraries more relevant to teens lives it suggests that just as youths technology practices are tightly connected with social and community relationships so are their library use practices another general theme was participants perceptions of information resources opinions about the relative ease of use of paper and digital resources varied with some students identifying paper books as more difficult to use and less familiar than digital resources and others identifying paper books as preferred for leisure reading and digital resources preferred for research and information searching all who compared the two types of resources however agreed that they had greater access to digital resources than to print and for that reason used the digital resources more
teens technology and libraries   overall these data provide us with an introductory picture of these students library experiences and perceptions the question now becomes how best to use these findings to improve library services and to make libraries more relevant to teens these teens were most likely to use school and public libraries as social and community gathering spaces for entertainment opportunities as places for volunteering opportunities and as places for quiet studyreadingcontemplation some also looked to libraries for information access but less so on the whole still the professional literature indicates an enduring overwhelming emphasis on libraries as resource providers and on libraries as paper book providers in particular agosto  based on these data it makes sense for library service providers at least in part to shift the traditional focus on libraries as resource providers to libraries as social opportunity and physical space providers this is not to suggest abandoning resource provision as a core of library services but it does suggest bolstering other aspects of library services such as libraries as social gathering and community building and collaboration spaces again the social support aspects of libraries are key especially for teens who often have limited mobility or limited access to places where they can safely or easily hang out and socialize libraries interested in increasing teen participation should look toward providing services that facilitate social interaction and they should focus on promoting libraries as social organizations just because the teens in this study tended to be infrequent library users does not mean that they were infrequent information users or infrequent information searchers in some cases these students were learning how to tailor their use of technology to find information in sophisticated ways other than going through libraries for example one of the girls age  had downloaded a search interface for a database of peer reviewed publications which she used for her chemistry class there are many teens who might benefit from learning about these kinds of resources outside of the physical and virtual boundaries of formal libraries for students with high levels of technology access such as those in our study librarians acting as technology educators to teach teens sophisticated information searching and resource evaluation and how to arm their phones or computers with available resources would probably be more useful than positioning libraries as technology access points thus this work suggests an additional shift from the traditional focus on librarians as resource providers to librarians as information educators again this was a specific group of teens with easy access to technology and generally high technology skills in reframing library services to appeal to the broader field of todays teens librarians should consider how to balance varying expectations of different groups with different backgrounds and needs within the library community such as balancing tensions between groups wanting socialization spaces and those looking for study spaces and groups of teens still looking mainly to libraries to provide them with information resources depending on the demographic composition of a community the balance of needs will vary in
  the library quarterly economically advantaged andor technology saturated communities teens are likely to have lower needs for technology access as was the case here in these types of communities the most effective approach might be to focus on providing community engagement opportunities civic participation outlets social activities and information education instead of focusing on information resource provision and on technology access provision for more disadvantaged communities public and school libraries might better serve teens by focusing resources and energy on providing technology access infrastructure and education and by providing information resources teens cant get elsewhere as is so often the case understanding context and community is key to developing effective services to meet community needs and to show teens that libraries are relevant to their needs and interests limitations this study provides rich understandings of how teens perceive and use libraries but there are limitations to this work due to ethics board requirements it was easier for students who were legal adults age  and older to complete the consent process than it was for younger students this resulted in participants ages skewing older additionally this study relies on self reported data which although good for illuminating thoughts perceptions and attitudes does not include external measures of access or use moreover this work is not generalizable to the full range of us teen populations all participants came from one unique context living and attending school in a large citya school with a science and technology curriculum focus that did not offer current access to a school librarian the generally high levels of parental educational attainment should also be noted here with  of students having at least one parent with an advanced degree this is quite a bit higher than the national average of  us census bureau  as is the case with any qualitative research study those wishing to apply the results to other contexts need to consider how the contexts vary and determine which aspects of the findings are likely transferable lincoln and guba  conclusion overall this study suggests that libraries might be better able to serve teensespecially teens living in tech heavy school and home contextsif they focused on creating and promoting services that could be more easily integrated into the teens existing technology use patterns although the frequency of social media use varied among the participants it was clear that on the whole technology use was a central feature of their everyday lives libraries on the other hand did not play a central role in any of their lives it is up to libraries to show teens that libraries and technology are not conflicting concepts of course most us public and school libraries do offer some technologically mediated services and provide a range of digital resources more than  offer public wi fi  offer
