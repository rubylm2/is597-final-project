 the library quarterly introduction in a thousand plateaus  gilles deleuze and felix guattari proposed the use of the metaphor of the rhizome for understanding the current merging of print and electronic communication their history of communication is delineated in terms of three types of books all currently in use the root book earliest the radicle system book second and the rhizome most recent examples of the proposed new aesthetic to which the principles of the rhizome are applied appear both in handheld book form and in various digital formats and in both reflect the hypertextual nature of the digital world in this article we have defined literature as referring to writing or illustration or other graphic representation demonstrating excellence of form or style and expressing ideas of widespread or long term interest therefore literature as defined is independent of medium the root book deleuze and guatarri root book imitates the world as art imitates nature by procedures specific to it that accomplish what nature cannot  in this article the terms youth young people and children are used interchangeably to describe the readers of children literature referring to preadolescents and adolescents through the end of high school  the discussion of deleuze and guattari work  in this article is limited to the application of the introductory chapter of a thousand plateaus  particularly to the metaphor of the rhizome developed in this chapter and to the analysis of contemporary literature for young people we are aware that the use of such a small portion of deleuze and guattari work out of context may raise issues that are not addressed in this article especially issues of politics and power we are also aware that the use of deleuze and guattari principles of the rhizome as a theoretical framework may be taken as an acritical adoption of the work as a whole of these french theorists this situation is not the case the use of the rhizome metaphor as a theoretical framework allows the authors to examine the contemporary situation through a contemporary lens and is more akin to the techniques of literary criticism than those of social science the rhizome is adopted here as an intuitively obvious metaphor for contemporary life as evidenced in publishing for children  the application of this metaphor to the discussion of hypertext technology literature and design was first noted by kathleen burnett   and subsequently by stuart moulthrop  both prior to the emergence of the world wide web in  by the time an earlier version of this article was presented at a conference entitled defining print culture for youth children and reading since  in madison wisconsin may  the application of deleuze and guattari metaphor to the description and analysis of the world wide web was widely accepted this article extends the application of the metaphor to the understanding of recent phenomena in print as well as electronic publishing for children and young adults eliza dresang has described this aesthetic as part of her critical approach to children literature known as radical change in her recent book radical change books for youth in a digital age  there she relates the aesthetic to the interactivity connectivity
rhizomorphic reading  or can no longer do   p  historically the root book emerged during the renaissance and reflects the mirror aesthetic associated with that period art and literature the aesthetic of the root book is often associated with handpress production but its expression is by no means limited to that technology appearing in literature created using photographic offset and even computer based production techniques the techniques most often associated with the production of the root book are those that predominated prior to the development of the pasteup technique that deleuze and guattari refer to as assemblage  p  the history of the root book is one of linear production in its earliest form the writing of the root book was synonymous with its publication today the production of the root book is still characterized as a linear process consisting of five steps  manuscript written  manuscript submitted and edited  manuscript composed in type  type sheets proofread and executed and  publication disseminated in its earliest manifestations and still today in certain fine printing and vanity publishing circles the production of the root book is characterized by oneness and stability as the production process has become more fragmented through the intervention of editors publishers designers and printers who are not the author the root book has maintained its mirror aesthetic even in its more recent manifestations the root book strives to be an exact replica of the author words a representation or signification of an individual thoughts the radicle system book according to deleuze and guattari the radicle system book differs from the root book in that the principal root has aborted or its tip has been destroyed an immediate indefinite multiplicity of secondary roots grafts onto it and undergoes a flourishing development  p  historically the radicle system book emerged concurrently with the avant garde art movements such as cubism dada de stijl and surrealism the assemblage techniques common to the radicle system book and these art movements are often associated with photography and photo offset production but as with the root book its expression is not limited to that technology examples of the radicle system book predate the development of the offset press by more than a century further examples of the continuing viability of the aesthetic of refabriand access evident in contemporary society and associated with the emergence of the digital environment
 the library quarterly cation associated with this book type can be found in some books and some cd rom productions of the last few years the production process of the radicle system book is less emphatically sequential than that of the root book the organizing principle being collage or assemblage this principle allows for alteration and reorganization at almost every stage of the production process it includes at least two additional steps the first the mock up or layout stage normally falls between the second and third root book steps the second the pasteup stage falls between the third and fourth steps in the production of the root book although representation is an essential element in the aesthetic of refabrication generated by the pasteup technique it is often obscured photography a technology frequently associated with representation and the mirror aesthetic is employed in the production of the radicle system book to ends that appear to be in direct opposition to representation here it is most often employed to reorganize the disparate elements of the radicle system book into a new assemblage or refabrication the rhizome book the third book type the rhizome is most often associated with and best supported by the technologies of electronically mediated exchange however examples of the influence of the new aesthetic of this book type can be found in literature produced using letterpress offset and any number of other production technologies deleuze and guattari describe the rhizome a system of this kind could be called a rhizome a rhizome as a subterranean stem is absolutely different from roots and radicles bulbs and tubers are rhizomes plants with roots or radicles may be rhizomorphic in other respects altogether burrows are too in all their functions of shelter supply movement evasion and breakout the rhizome itself assumes very diverse forms from ramified surface extension in all directions to concretion into bulbs and tubers the rhizome includes the best and the worst potato and couchgrass or the weed  pp   the rhizome book is a metaphor rhizomes themselves are organic forms that proliferate like crabgrass or kudzu beyond our control to determine and shape them telecommunications systems exhibit rhizomorphic characteristics as do computer networks especially in their growth and proliferation books may also be rhizomorphic in their  research conducted by the ovum market research company has predicted that the number of people with internet access worldwide will quadruple by  in a report tided internet market forecasts global internet growth   ovum forecasts  million
rhizomorphic reading  form format or content as well as in their production as in each of the earlier book types the rhizome has an associated aesthetic this time one that we suggest reflects the hypertextual nature of the digital environment this hypertext aesthetic is more complex and requires an in depth exploration from the perspective of contemporaneous analysis the rhizome book and literature for youth for decades literature for youth has had a generally predictable straightforward plot structure and format numerous examples in recent children literature that depart from this time honored pattern are interesting but are difficult both to understand and to explain when taken as individual literary works they may disturb some critics others may attribute them to individual creativity as has been the case for the less prevalent departures from the norm in the past still others may not yet have realized how substantial or significant this rupture with tradition has become or why the current environment nurtures it the nature and quantity of this new children literature that breaks traditional linear rules of presentation in unpredictable and challenging ways make it a fertile test bed for deleuze and guattari hypertext aesthetic in her book titled radical change booksfor youth in a digital age  eliza dresang designates the manifestations of this aesthetic that reflect the interactivity connectivity and access of the digital world as changing forms and formats changing perspectives and changing focus in literature for youth the changing forms and formats bring graphics in new forms and formats words and pictures reaching new levels of synergy nonlinear organization and format nonsequential organization and format multiple layers of meaning and interactive formats the changing perspectives incorporate multiple perspectives visual and verbal images previously unheard voices and youth who speak for themselves the changing focus rests in subjects previously forbidden settings previously overlooked characters previously unseen new types of communities and unresolved endings to introduce this aesthetic dresang uses an award winning picture book peter sis stany messenger  the arrangement of the contents of this book to convey meaning reflects the flexibility and the synergy of print and graphics in the digital world the sparse but compelling dial up connections and  million permanent connections in the year   for longitudinal data on internet growth see jim pitkow  
 the library quarterly text tells the story that appears in easy to read type at the bottom of the page often in the lower left hand corner the real words of galileo and his contemporaries appear in a much more difficult to decipher font configured in a way that suggests their message for example in the shape of an eye or a telescope on a spacious white background this visual presentation signals that the medieval scholars words contain concepts that require more thought from the reader the text appears around and superimposed on the bold pictures that cover most of the double page spreads graphic symbols within the pictures and throughout the pages become an integral part of the whole story the hypertextual nature of the book allows readers to chose a simple straightforward linear experience reading only the text in modern type or to become an interactive participant in creating a more complex multilayered story through weaving together the nonlinear components a thorough reading of this picture book demands a high level of intellectual involvement the child reader of this book is introduced to ideas such as the dogma of the church and the rejection of truth that were previously considered too sophisticated for inclusion in books for youth the application of deleuze and guattari rhizome metaphor to children literature provides a theoretical framework for scholarly analysis of this emerging hypertextual aesthetic and many of its manifestations deleuze and guattari delineate six principles of the rhizome that provide a vivid metaphor for this new hypertextual aesthetic in literature for youth  connection  heterogeneity  multiplicity  asignifying rupture  cartography and  decalcomania  pp  these principles are explicated in the following sections each section begins with a discussion of the principle itself followed by discussion of its application to recent literature for youth drawing on specific examples the examples cited are not intended to be exhaustive we have chosen two books judged best books for young adults by the american library association maus i and maus ii   their cd rom companion  and several interrelated web sites   to provide consistency of reference in the illustration of several of the rhizomorphic principles for a more extensive listing of recent literature for youth exemplifying this aesthetic see dresang book  and the accompanying web site  principles of connection and heterogeneity theory the principles of connection and heterogeneity state that any point of a rhizome can be connected to any other and must be  p 
rhizomorphic reading  in this sense a rhizome is different from a tree structure where the order is fixed by a hierarchy of relationships cognitive jumps which must be mechanically forced in a hierarchy are intuitively sustained in a rhizome a rhizome is the only structure that can effectively sustain connections between different media without giving hegemony to language this principle may explain in part the dramatic increase in picture book production during the s as books take on more characteristics of the rhizome adult readers become more accustomed to rhizomorphic reading the appearance of a genre of picture books for young adults and adults  p xi is probably less symptomatic of the rising illiteracy that alarmists often warn of than it is of increasing comfort with rhizomorphic reading for many youth born between the late s and  the cognitive jump to rhizomorphic reading was accomplished through nontraditional nonprint avenues such as the introduction of the computer to the home exposure to video games recent television programming and participation in electronically mediated communication especially computer mediated interactive forums such as chat rooms and multiuser dimensions muds multiuser object oriented dimensions moos and multiuser shared hallucinations mushs children born since the late s have benefited from the migration of this new aesthetic into the print world as adults they will be less likely than their parents and even than their older brothers and sistersto associate literature with any one medium linear schools and workplaces that formerly forced youth to straighten out their thinking as they matured are themselves changed by the digital environment and over time are less likely to force into a predetermined mold the new thinking patterns of youth growing up in a digital world the move to a nonlinear digital world with billions of microchips at work each day is too pervasive to be considered a passing fad the dramatic increase in books reflecting this aesthetic in the children literature selected for award or distinction in the s is documented in dresang comparison of books receiving these kudos in  and   p  this analysis does not however assume that all or even most reading will fit this aesthetic just as the root book and the radicle system book  in  children under age  numbered  million or  percent of the population down from a peak of  percent at the end of the baby boom httpwwwchildstatsgov aclhighlitehtm nonetheless the number of picture books has dramatically increased suggesting a reason beyond population growth  in  approximately  percent of households with children were online it is projected that in the year  almost  percent of households with children will be online  p  federal legislation providing assistance to school and public libraries with online access is projected to assume  percent hookup by the year 
 the library quarterly continue to exist alongside the rhizomorphic book in deleuze and guattari metaphorical treatise more traditional approaches to reading will coexist with rhizomorphic reading over the past decade a number of scholars have pointed out the convergence of hypertext technology and the notion of connection notable among them stuart moulthrop  j david bolter  kathleen burnett   kathleen burnett and e g mckinley  george p landow   janet h murray  and michael joyce  as moulthrop stated in  seen from the viewpoint of textual theory hypertext systems appear as the practical implementation of a conceptual movement that rejects authoritarian ogocentric ie truth affirming hierarchies of language whose modes of operation are linear and deductive and seeks instead systems of discourse that admit a plurality of meanings where the operative modes are hypothesis and interpretive play  p  while the characteristics of rhizomorphic authoring and reading are most easily demonstrated in the context of hypertext the new aesthetic is not technologically bound in hypertext the convergence of contemporaiy critical theoy and technology  landow cites numerous authors and literary critics whose work in the print medium demonstrates proto hypertextual characteristics in a paper delivered at the international association of word and image studies third international congress in ottawa canada august  burnett  pointed out the implicit hierarchy in landow account citing several women wnters whose work should be acknowledged as proto hypertextual burnett and mckinley  in a paper delivered at the  annual conference of the international communication association extended this work to include women writers of color heterogeneous connection is a central theme in the latter two papers that demonstrates the importance of this notion not only to understanding what rhizomorphic authoring and reading are but also in constructing a history that nurtures and encourages through inclusion and connection rather than exclusion and hierarchy to date children literature has not been discussed in this context other than in dresang work     nonetheless recent children publishing includes many fine examples of connection and heterogeneity examples as readers become more accustomed to rhizomorphic reading new genres emerge across all media the diary project  is an interactive public space where youth are invited to tell their own stories it was inspired by the book version of zlata filipovic diary kept during the early days of the breakup of the former yugoslavia  the entries
rhizomorphic reading  in this rhizomorphic domain of self expression give rise to multilogues which in turn help children and young adults to find communities of common interest and concern across geographic boundaries the multilogic communitarian interactive assertion of the reader as author and reader as participant is a key component in the new aesthetic in children literature such multilogic domains both print and electronic enable the connectivity of what deleuze and guattari refer to as semiotic chains a rhizome ceaselessly establishes connections between semiotic chains organizations of power and circumstances relative to the arts sciences and social struggles a semiotic chain is like a tuber agglomerating very diverse acts not only linguistic but also perceptive mimetic gestural and cognitive there is no language in itself nor are there any linguistic universals only a throng of dialects patois slangs and specialized languages  p  palm of my heart poetry by african american children  is a multiauthored and therefore heterogeneous collection it is also heterogeneous in that it addresses an audience that until recently has been virtually disenfranchised by children publishing in  only  percent of all publishing for children was by or about people of color this percentage reflects encouraging signs of growth in the first half of this decade in the area of multicultural literature for children and young adults  p  the heterogeneity of authorship in palm of my heart fosters identification for the rhizomorphic child reader any child reader will find a child author in this volume whose color age or expression strikes a chord having found that chord the rhizomorphic child reader looks to establish meaningful connections to other poems and poets while poetry has always been an experimental form few poets writing for youth in the past have experimented with the type of heterogeneity and connectivity that appears here and increasingly in other contemporary poetry for youth the short poems by children can be read as heterogeneous texts with subtexts brought out by the typography as in the first poem by pre chezz rudolph black stride it the arch of my back the curve of my spine the way i stand and my stance is pride  unpaged a thin horizontal rule separates this poem from the one that follows it by t j moore jr
 the library quarterly bhack culture is a secret shared in the night a whispered thought the wonders of the mind a swirling of belief  unpaged typographic variation is used as a device to establish meaningful connections between the heterogeneous texts of the palm of my heart  bold type is used to create new poems of connection comprised of words by the heterogeneous authors for example the bold type in the two poems cited above form a poem of connection black pride black culture is the wonders of the mind this connection runs throughout the slender volume creating a single interconnected multiauthored poem ending with the line black spirit is energetic  unpaged jon scieszka and lane smith  also use typographic variation in the stinky cheese man and otherfairly stupid tales but to different ends here the words grow shrink change color and direction words become visual elements that do things as does the table of contents which like a stage curtain takes a disastrous fall the table of contents was it fell and squashed everybody the end  unpaged in the stinky cheese man typographic variation emphasizes heterogeneity while the pictures have a consistent style the words mix things up black and white  by david macaulay is a particularly interesting example of the principles of connection and heterogeneity in simultaneous interaction connections are drawn through the use of color and form between the four panels representing four apparently separate stories a black and white dog holstein cows newspaper stone pathways a bandit and a chorus in which the bandit and cow udders mysteriously appear integrate the stories of a boy first trip alone on a train an unusual day in the life of a family waiting for a train and utter udder chaos and yet the stories can also be read as separate heterogeneous narratives without any recognition of the carefully orchestrated interconnection moos also occur across space connecting individuals otherwise geographically dispersed connection in addition to interest in the story is among the primary motivations for getting involved in a roleplaying moo participants note that at certain stages in their lives where face to face interactions are difficult and often too intense to
rhizomorphic reading  deal with moos provide a shielded safe house for interaction and communication these environments are more psychologically evocative than traditional face to face role playing games as sherry turkle has noted because they further blur the line between the game and real life usually referred to in cyberspace as rl in face to face role playing games one steps in and out of a character muds and moos in contrast offer a character or characters that may become parallel identities  p  author addition connection and heterogeneity also operate at the individual level the ability to try out multiple parallel identities helps youth to experiment with connecting their apparently heterogeneous selves in life on the screen  turkle examines this in some depth she concludes that contrary to popular fears experimentation of this type is a largely healthy phenomenon principle of multiplicity theory a multiplicity has neither subject nor object only determinations magnitudes and dimensions that cannot increase in number without the multiplicity changing in nature an assemblage is precisely this increase in the dimensions of a multiplicity that necessarily changes in nature as it expands its connections there are no points or positions in a rhizome much as those found in a structure tree or root there are only lines  p  landow and others have noted the hypertextual nature of prehypertext literary projects as mentioned above landow establishes a rather conspicuously white male canon as he debunks the traditional linear canon for a hypertextual one multiplicity as a principle of the new aesthetic of rhizomorphic reading recognizes a multiplicity of relationships beyond the canonical or hierarchical as connectivity blurs the boundary between author and reader multiplicity problematizes the hierarchy that is canonical in recent children publishing the traditional canon has come under scrutiny through a variety of lenses including the focus on multicultural literature mentioned previously in addition recent children literature is scrutinizing long held notions of the preferences and abilities of child readers recent literature for youth demonstrates levels of complexity in form format plot and structure once thought to be too complicated for a young audience topics previously considered to be taboo such as sex sexual orientation violence child abuse and others are emerging as themes in
 the library quarterly books for young as well as older children these taboo topics are also part of the new aesthetic of rhizomorphic reading because every point in the rhizome is connected to every other point  all topics that may touch a child life however complex or difficult to understand belong to the rhizome of children literature examples the use of a comic book format to tell the story of a holocaust survivor in maus illustrates the principle of multiplicity deleuze and guattari describe the ideal rhizome book as follows the ideal for a book would be to lay everything out on a plane of exteriority  on a single page the same sheet lived events historical determinations concepts individuals groups social formation  p  the comic book format is superficially monolithic panels marching across the page in three regular rows much like an army in formation in his discussion included on the cd rom version of maus spiegelman highlights the use of a variety of techniques to communicate connection and multiplicity comparing the panels illustrating a trip to a sanitarium that occurs early in the novel  p  and the gates to auschwitz  p  spiegelman points to the way layout emphasizes both the connection between these two experiences and their disparity the gates to auschwitz page  p  is designed to subliminally remind the reader of something seen earlier in the book  p  the panel structure is in many ways reminiscent of the earlier page when vladek is going with anja to a sanitarium in czechoslovakia that page has a train followed by windows looking in at the passengers followed by a large panel of them looking out at the swastika they are seeing for the first time the size of the panel emphasizes the importance of this image the later page  p  in which the couple takes another journey has a parallel structure starting with a truck instead of a train but also an open panel that is not enclosed by panel borders there are no windows in the truck but each of the two panels serves itself as a window inviting the reader to enter inside the vehicle a large panel follows each the panel on page  is the largest panel in the book too big to be contained within the book this panel represents the entrance to auschwitz in the earlier page  p  the swastika is the central motif at the center of the panel that swastika is seen near the center of the panel on the side of the truck  p  and with the words arbeit macht frei work makes you free above it  audio file defining the page a closer look at the panels in the book version reveals many irregularitiesopen panels containing present commentary on the past close ups contained in cameo like circles and panels set at a disjunc
rhizomorphic reading  tive angle reflecting the despair pictured in many ways multiplicity is more honestly employed in the print than in the cd rom version where the overcoding clearly organizes the presentation although the hypertextual technology employed more readily supports multiplicity than does the handheld book an example of multiplicity can be found in the moos based on anne mccaffrey fantasies set on the planet of pern while motivation for joining a moo is often connection and the identification of a homogenous community within the larger heterogeneity of the internet multiplicity is perhaps the most clearly evident operating principle of the moo environment itself dragonsfire moo  is an environment established by common agreement among its participants based on their multiple interpretations of mccaffrey pern novels respect for others perspectives is a requirement for participation participants of one moo often participate in others for example for those interested in role playing in pern no fewer than four moos and fourteen mushs exist with many of the participants in one playing a different role in another the list of dragons maintained at the dragonsfire web site includes information about dragons hatched at dragonsfire moo that have flown off to other moos such as harper tale  star stones  and virtuapern  each moo builds its own textual environment taking off from different points in mccaffrey series each of these environments represents a group interpretation a multiplicity of perspectives interwoven of the pern novels this interpretation is constantly growing and changing molded by its participants who themselves grow change and move from one to the other and back again to the extent that overcoding exists in the moo environment it does so by consent of the participants and it operates as a kind of contract between the author of the works on which the moo is based and the readers who take an active role in extending the story in this example of rhizomorphic reading readers become active agents in constructing shared spaces built solely of words in addition moos are programmed environments that require programmers to build and shape the environment moo programming capability is typically controlled through the specification of user types the user type with the most far reaching programming capability is usually denoted as wizard one or more wizards may participate in a given moo designations of user types for lower levels of programming capability vary from moo to moo with the assignment of such capability resting ultimately with the wizards though most moos operate on a consensual basis in the assignment of programming capability wizards also have the capability of spamming participants who do not conform
 the library quarterly to the moo guidelines spamming blocks the participant access to the moo effectively disabling participation most moos have fairly strict rules regarding the use of spamming many require consensus at some level of participation for spamming to be executed an example of the principle of multiplicity operating in a handheld book without significant overcoding is walk two moons by sharon creech  creech layers multiple journeys and tales in this story of a girl coming to terms with her mother death walk two moons begins with the introduction of a story told by the girl salamanca the reason that phoebe story reminds me of that plaster wall and the hidden fireplace is that beneath phoebe story was another one mine  p  this layering of story behind a story occurs throughout walk two moons sal tells peebee story to her grandparents as together they retrace the route of her mother fataljourney her grandparents comments on the telling and their reactions to the tale are incorporated by sal into her own understanding and acceptance of what happened to her mother and what that means for her on the tombstone beneath her name and the dates of her birth and death was an engraving of a maple tree and it was only then when i saw the stone and her name chanhassen sugar pickford hiddle and the engraving of the tree that i knew by myself and for myself that she was not coming back  p  walk two moons emphasizes salamanca struggle to find her own meaning in the layers and interpretations of stories it is particularly remarkable that it does so without moralizing or passing judgment on the decisions made by the characters whose lives are contained in these stories principle of asignifying rupture theoty children literature critic perry nodelman uses the term vaniation to explain a phenomenon of literary change within sameness in a manner that complements the asignifying rupture principle of deleuze and guattari nodelman observes so variation most clearly represents the process by which the past claims the present the old the new the adult the child but merely because the varying continues there is the implication that the claiming always fails for if it succeeded why the need to try to do it yet again  p  deleuze and guattari explain it in this way a rhizome may be broken shattered at a given spot but it will start up again on one of its old lines or on new lines every rhizome contains lines of segmentarity
rhizomorphic reading  according to which it is stratified territorialized organized signified attributed etc as well as lines of deterritorialization down which it constantly flees there is rupture in the rhizome whenever segmentary lines explode into a line of flight but the line of flight is part of the rhizome  p  the principle of asignifying rupture operates in a variety of contexts affecting content form and format as well as blurring the traditional relationship between author and reader an incidence of asignifying rupture requires rupture a line of flight and incorporation of both the rupture itself and the line of flight into the organic whole of the rhizome it is tempting to state that the traditional narrative structure the line of flightsetting the stage introducing the problem possibly a rupture working through the prow lem resolving the problem and they all lived happily ever after operationalizes the principle of asignifying rupture however this summarization is too simple and not what deleuze and guattari intended by this principle often in traditional narrative structures the resolution of the problem is accomplished through one of two vehicles  the problem is revealed as a misinterpretation of an innocent situation thereby rendering it insignificant or  the character or situation giving rise to the problem is rendered impotent or just plain disappears thereby erasing its significance in either case the happy ending produces the risk of dismissing the problem the rupture and the line of flight this is particularly true in moral tales and stories that are intended to instruct the reader or provide support and direction in resolving the conflicts of everyday life the happy ending does not necessarily always undercut the continued flight in some cases it is incidental to the ruptures that will last with the reader long after leaving the book in a rhizome book the rupture and the line of flight maintain or even gain in importance following the resolution if any examples several books for youth illustrate the principle of asignifying rupture maus is a biographical tale of rupture and flight framed within another the middle passage  is a powerful pictorial rendering of the horror of the rupture captivity which resolves itself into more than a century of slavery and the theme of walk two moons is the need for survivors to acknowledge and work through the ultimate rupturedeath in each case problem a rupture and the line of flight retain their significance following the resolution that signals the end of the book the principle of asignifying rupture also manifests in form and format the publication of the same material in multiple media or the migration of content theme or subject matter from one medium to

rhizomorphic reading  the present and his more reflective rendering of the past this approach affords the reader the opportunity to experience the tale through a kaleidoscopic multiplicity of lenses his father a polish jew represented as a mouse in an environment peopled by pigs poles and cats germans traces his own path through the landscape that is the holocaust and establishes a new home for himself and his family in rego park but as the prologue makes clear life in rego park is no paradise half the way around the world bullies still tease young boys yet in this exclusive mouse community one thing has changedthe bullies are no longer easily identified by their species for the bullies artie calls his friends are neither pigs nor cats but mice just like him the message is as dark and complex as the black and white panels of the cartoon life is not simple in ma us nor is it black and white there is according to deleuze and guattari no difference between what a book talks about and how it is made   p  in a further amplification of the slice of life or asignifying rupture technique spiegelman includes video segments in the cd rom version of the interviews with his real life father that provided the material for maus  deleuze and guattari describe the notion of a book as something like ma us a book has neither object nor subject it is made of variously formed matters and very different dates and speeds to attribute the book to a subject is to overlook this working of matters and the exteriority of their relations in a book as in all things there are lines of articulation or segmentarity strata and territories but also lines of flight movements of deterritorialization and destratification comparative rates of flow on these lines produce phenomena of relative slowness and viscosity or on the contrary of acceleration and rupture all this lines and measurable speeds constitutes an assemblage  pp   emphasis in original in mid  arlene sardine  a picture book by chris raschka brought the concept of asignifying rupture to books for the very young arlene was a little fish called a brisling who lived in a fjord with ten hundred thousand friends arlene was pretty happy except that she wanted to be a sardine and that is exactly what she achieves to accomplish her dream arlene dies half way through the book the plot conventions of books for young children do not allow the heroine to die at all much less before the book comes to an end to provide even more tension between the expected and the delivered raschka uses vivid happy colors and lyrical words all the while that arlene is being chopped and canned this authorartist took his own line of flight while maintaining the journeyquest foundation so common in books for youth moos began as a kind of asignifying rupture the socially con

rhizomorphic reading  to constant modification   p  what makes it possible for the rhizomorphic reader to synthesize input from multiple sources simultaneously through multiple media in a shared context each rhizomorphic reader interpretation of a text is as individually valid as any other reader individual interpretation new interpretations can be grafted onto the old providing fresh ways of interacting with the text and sharing meaning constructed in the process of this interaction the map is the reader orientation within the context of relationships to all texts and all readers of these texts as well as the more limited context of the single text in isolation from other texts a rhizomorphic reader map is closely related to geographic maps it shows the path of the reader through the surrounding territory but always from the point of view of the reader it is as though the map were perpetually shifting as the traveler moved from one quadrant to the next some of that territory is charted it is well mapped out in terms that the reader understands and connected to familiar territory or nodes and some is uncharted either because it consists of unlinked nodes that exist in the text much as an undiscovered island might exist in the sea disconnected from the lines of transfer and communication linking other land areas or as an unidentified planet in space with the potential for discovery and even exploration butasyetjusta glimmer in the sky or because it is linked in ways that are meaningless to the reader in his present context the reader can zoom in on zones of interestjump to new territories using previously established links or by establishing new links of his own retrace an earlier path or create new islands or nodes and transportation routes or links to connect them to his previous path or the islands or nodes charted by others the rhizome operates by variation expansion conquest capture and offshoots unlike the graphic arts drawing or photography unlike tracings the rhizome pertains to a map that must be produced constructed a map that is always detachable connectable reversible modifiable and has multiple entryways and exits and its own lines of flight it is tracings that must be put on the map not the opposite in contrast to centered even polycentric systems with hierarchical modes of communication and preestablished paths the rhizome is an a centered nonhierarchical nonsignifying system without a military general and without an organizing memory of central automaton defined solely by a circulation of states  p  the rhizome is as individual as the individual in contact with it it is that individual perception that individual map that individual understanding it is also and at the same time a completely different something another individual perception another individual map another individual understanding it provides no structure for

rhizomorphic reading  interestingly mccaulay warning to the reader on the title page is not specific about the number of stories the book appears to contain the frames operate as windows or plateaus flat horizontal representations of three dimensional reality they are a visual representation of what deleuze and guattari describe as the process of writing of a thnousand plateaus we are writing this book as a rhizome it is composed of plateaus each plateau can be read starting anywhere and can be related to any other plateau  p  tracing the frames of black and white as individual plateaus it would seem that there are four stories however the reader is also given the option to follow the thief out of the prison window on the title page down the tied sheets over the second page and into the watering hole on the fourth page the line of flight of the thief is given an additional dimension shadowing elevates the tied sheets from the plateau of the page and acts as a tracing the tracing should always be put back on the map emphasizes deleuze and guattari  p  emphasis in original the tracing does not reproduce the map but instead provides another means of reading it the tracing of the thief does not stop in the water hole two openings later this tracing shifts from the stories to the right of the gutter to those on the left now the thief appears on the television in the lower left frame it has shifted from one plateau to another and while the children in the frame where the thief now makes his appearance are clearly looking off to the right and responding to their parents unexpected appearance the dog white with a black patch across his face is just as clearly questioning his relationship to the image on the television mom dad the tracing of the thief crosses plateaus in this and other ways the black and white thief becomes the dog newspapers and holstein cows that appear across the plateaus blending and merging in a kaleidoscopic pattern toward the end of the book a brief interval occurs devoid of color and framing the four framed stories are merged in a single black and white plateau the tracing has been placed back on the map throughout black and white the reader following the thief down the tied sheets sees the surrounding frames as views from the window of a train as the boy in the first frame seeing things might view the passing scenery on the final page of the book following that point traditionally identified with the end of the content another layering of framing is superimposed on the previous altering the meaning of what came before a hand places a toy train station identical to that seen in earlier frames on the floor in the upper right corner we can just see the dog nose and in his mouth a bit of newspaper two additional bits fall like confetti from the sky again as in the earlier frames one with the library of congress cip data and the other with the copy
 the library quarterly right information for black and white this simple device integrates the author and the reader into the text as fellow imaginers the tracing is placed on the map the book forms a rhizome with the world conclusions a new aesthetic is emerging in contemporary children literature and with it a new reader deleuze and guattari six metaphoric principles of the rhizome book connection heterogeneity multiplicity asignifying rupture cartography and decalcomania provide a framework for understanding the relationships between this new hypertextual aesthetic and reading behavior while many alarmists among the best known is neil postman   have worried that the introduction of electronic media into homes and schools will mean the end of a literate and educated populace the authors of this article have observed and delineated something quite the opposite as don tapscott documents in grozing up digital  there is no evidence of a direct correlation between increased use of electronic media and declining literacy on the contrary the use of electronic media by young people appears to point to an extension of the values associated with literacy rhizomorphic reading reaches beyond the isolated practice of absorbing and understanding handheld texts for the rhizomorphic reader the act of reading extends beyond text off the printed page and into new electronic spaces that facilitate the construction of shared meanings it is a participatory and creative act of sense making the rhizomorphic reader is an actively engaged author simultaneously and interactively synthesizing new inputs from multiple sources and through multiple media and sharing these spontaneously in electronic spaces constructed entirely of words the imaginings of authors bold enough to venture into the new aesthetic together with the reimaginings of the rhizomorphic reader forge new dynamic meanings for authoring reading and literacy literacy is the fundamental skill set on which our ability to maintain an informed populace has rested for centuries this situation has not changed but the definition of what it means to be literate must change no longer will it be adequate to ensure that our children can decode symbols on a page today developing rhizomorphic reader must be adept at decoding and much more these active and multiprocessing readers have the potential of becoming better informed more active citizens than their counterparts of the previous generation we are confident that the growing cadre of authors illustrators designers and publishers of children literature pushing beyond the mirror aesthetic
