a utilitarian case for intellectual freedom in libraries tony doyle the article begins with an outline of the history of censorship and intellectual and expressive freedom in american libraries chiefly from the last quarter of the nineteenth century until the social responsibility movement of the late s and early s discussion of the two main types of ethical theory utilitarianism and deontology is next then the deontological position on intellectual freedom is presented in the context of its theory of rights the discussion of deontology is followed by a utilitarian criticism of the deontological defense of intellectual freedom then a utilitarian defense of intellectual freedom is offered and applied to libraries the article concludes by arguing that even though in theory utilitarianism would countenance some censorship in practice the utilitarian will support complete intellectual freedom it is maintained that libraries have a special role to play in promoting unconditional intellectual freedom introduction to make a case for unrestricted intellectual and expressive freedom is to make a case against all forms of censorship the case is a moral one because it defends certain conduct as right and endorses it as the conduct that ought to be followed as diana woodward points out censorship becomes an ethical issue when there is some ood reason for censoring that is set in opposition to a ood reason for not censoring  p  this article will consider two different arguments in favor of intellectual freedom and against censorship one a rightsbased or deontological position defended by david ward  the other a utilitarian position roughly followingjohn stuart mill on liberty  this article will endorse the latter maintaining that libraries have a special role to play in promoting intellectual freedom and as bulwarks  reference librarian hunter college library  park avenue new york new york  telephone   fax    e mail tdoyleshivahuntercunyedu libraiy quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
intellectual freedom  against the censor censorship here will be understood to be any deliberate impediment on the expression of or access to any ideas or images intellectual or expressive freedom to be the freedom to publish or have access to any ideas or images by way of background i would first like to survey the evolution of american librarians and the american library association ala position with regard to censorship american libraries and censorship historical background those not familiar with the history of library censorship in the united states might imagine that the ala and prominent american librarians have always opposed censorship and championed intellectual freedom the ala position today as officially expressed in the library bill of rights  and the freedom to read articles  in the intellectual freedom manual  and its statement of professional ethics with regard to these issues is extremely liberal although this position was not always the case the spirit of mill was a long time coming to the ala and to this country leading librarians witness the opening of judith f krug and james a harvey ala and intellectual freedom a historical overview which appears in the fifth  edition of the ala intellectual freedom manual at the outset two myths can be dispelled namely that intellectual freedom in libraries is a tradition and that intellectual freedom has always been a major if not the major part of the foundation of library service in the united states both myths assumed by many librarians are grounded in the belief that librarians support a static conception of intellectual freedom nothing however could be further from the truth  p xix see also  p  evelyn geller writing over a generation ago agrees in all these recent discussions the concept of intellectual freedom has been so much taken for granted as a self evident truth that we scarcely realize that the idea far from being an eternal principle has only been present in librarianship in a significant way for a little more than a generation  p  in fact there has been considerable change in how librarians think of intellectual freedom since the ala was founded in  a brief survey of some hoary examples should be enough to convince the reader that far from taking the lead in the battle for intellectual freedom until the early decades of the twentieth century prominent american librarians routinely engaged in a rearguard action against intellectual freedom advocating paternalistic censorship the debate did not center on whether there ought to be library censorship but rather on
 the library quarterly how much and what kind as ronald heckart points out what we would regard as censorship had a positive value for american librarians in the stewardship era that is from the earliest days of public libraries until late s their duty was to promote books that would uplift readers and to suppress books that would do readers harm  p  librarians then generally conceived their mission to be the elevation of taste and the development of skills  p  along with improving manners and teaching virtue and good citizenship  p  and that meant seeing that their collections were free of improper books  p  the librarian as jan dee fujimoto points out was the postle of culture or the issionary of literature his chief reason for being was to uplift the masses beyond their narrow daily perspective to etter them  p  fujimoto proceeds to maintain that the battle against fiction in libraries that was waged in the second half of the nineteenth century was largely a recognition of the librarians duty not to provide books that might incite crime or immorality  p  for instance in the mid s william frederick poole later president of the ala argued that librarians were responsible for ensuring that there were no immoral and false novels in their collections the librarian who would allow an immoral novel in his library for circulation would be as culpable as the manager of a picture gallery who should have an indecent picture on his walls quoted in  p  in  f b perkins of the san francisco free public library echoed poole according to john swan perkins was expressing the dominant sentiment of the profession when he wrote  say that a free public library has no business to furnish licentious immoral or vulgar books a free public library is an educational institution its first requisite is therefore that it should be useful should do good its office as to amusement is of very minor importance the business of teaching immorality it ought not to practice at all  pp   this conception of librarianship continued into the early twentieth century witness for example the following excerpt from arthur bostwick  ala presidential address the librarian as censor ome are born great some achieve greatness some have greatness thrust upon them it is in this way that the librarian has become a censor of literature books that distinctly commend what is wrong that teach how to sin and how pleasant sin is sometimes with and sometimes without the added sauce of impropriety are increasingly popular tempting the author to imitate them their publishers to produce the bookseller to exploit thank heaven they do not tempt the librarian quoted in  p xxii  for more examples see   p   p  and  p 
intellectual freedom  libraries have also been used as forums both for political indoctrination and propaganda for instance herbert putnam librarian of congress   and ala president  and  opined that libraries are progressive in many things but conservative when it concerns morals and social order he urged librarians to use their influence in counterbalancing the revolutionary tendency of the age  p  as for propaganda wayne wiegand in his an active instrument for propaganda the american public library during world war i points out that during the first world war in public libraries across the country librarians quietly but willingly pulled from their shelves any title that might raise suspicions of disloyalty  p  it is not surprising that censors generally targeted materials either written in german or deemed pro german along with antiwar materials  pp  and   despite some opposition by librarians to wartime censorship  pp   the profession claims wiegand for the most part  did not resist and in fact willingly though quietly participated in the campaign to rid their shelves of disloyal or seditious material  p  concludes wiegand when viewed from the perspective of the late twentieth century the american public library community clearly failed to resist censorship during world war i  p  there were signs in the s that the ala position on intellectual freedom was beginning to warp into something like its familiar form  p xxi the idea that libraries should provide access to all kinds of ideas all viewpoints began to gain currency says david lincove growing numbers of librarians struggled for greater democracy in library management and greater freedom to provide the public access to books and periodicals even if they included controversial ideas on politics and society freedom rather than paternalistic protection and guidance began to take root  p  the new theme was sounded in  by george bowerman who a dozen years earlier in his capacity as director of the washington dc public library had removed german works from the shelves and forced patrons to come to the circulation desk to request them  p  bowerman now held that the public library is not an institution for the inculcation of standardized ideas and it is not afraid of new ideas new art forms new literature it stands for free opinion and to that end it supplies material on both sides of every controversial question of human interest quoted in  p  other leading librarians of the s for example gretchen garrison and bernice hodges made similar appeals hodges paying particular attention to the important role that an uncensored library should play in a healthy democracy  pp  all were soundly rejecting the librarian as censor model defended for example by herbert putnam and arthur bostwick all as
 the library quarterly we will see below were making a fundamentally millian point against censorship see  pp  a the preceding suggests that censorship pressure has tended to come from the right from those who feel that their values political religious or sexual are threatened by new ideas or forms of expression and it has however in the late s and early s an attack on intellectual freedom sprang from the left with the so called social responsibility movement says ralph e mccoy during the late s and early s the historic meaning of intellectual freedom was challenged by an aggressive section of the ala that supported the advocacy concept under which libraries would play an active role in providing materials that would promote certain social goals  p  the movement challenged the idea that the mission of the library is to represent all points of view equally that libraries and librarians should be neutral with regard to the leading social issues of the day instead its leaders urged that libraries take a stand against for example the vietnam war racism or sexism and that the collection support this orientation david berninghausen a longtime leading promoter of intellectual freedom in libraries see  for example pp   and  took on the social responsibility movement in  offering two arguments first according to louise s robbins he appealed to librarians professional responsibility and to the importance of retaining the unity of the ala defining librarianship in terms of ocial responsibility to take stands on various social issues  would not only lead to the compromise of the library profession first obligation to make available all kinds of speech even the most unpopular but would also lead to a fragmentation of the american library association  p  berninghausen also condemned the social responsibility movement as undemocratic to the extent that it would deprive citizens of access to all points of view access to which is needed to make informed decisions about which policies to endorse and which candidates to support to wit unless men have access to all varieties of expression as to the facts theories and the alternative solution to these problems they will be unable to apply their powers of reason toward their resolution   libraries continued to feel political pressure to censor after world war ii for instance as a result of mccarthyism in the late s and early s public libraries came under pressure to control procommunist or subversive materials the solution was often to label such material but the ala struck back offering its statement on labeling in  on the grounds that no reasonable criteria for subversive material could be promulgated and that labeling implies an endorsement of certain ideas by the library the ala statement denounced labeling as a censor tool calculated to prejudice the reader  p 
intellectual freedom  p  librarians are professionally obliged to see that all points of view are represented in their libraries but defending positions on specific issues is outside librarians professional competence  p  that librarians should see that materials in the library serve some social cause is at odds with their professional responsibility to maintain as high a degree of impartiality and neutrality as is humanly possible  and to build balanced collections representing all points of view on controversial issues regardless of their personal convictions or moral beliefs  p  in short social responsibility would force libraries to cease striving to maintain free access to all points of view  p  the ala position today in  the ala finally promulgated the library bill of rights  it was as krug and harvey point out the precursor to the present library bill of rights the profession basic statement on intellectual freedom involving library materials  p xxiii the original document has been modified five times since     and   pp   today krug and harvey state the library bill of rights is meant to provide principles upon which libraries may stand to oppose censorship and promote intellectual freedom  p xxv the other important official statement of the ala is the freedom to read  its first version was approved in  and it was most recently revised in  the statement has been subsequently endorsed by numerous other organizations including the american civil liberties union people for the american way the american booksellers association and the association of american university presses  p  it is meant to be a more elaborate defense of intellectual freedom than the terse library bill of rights it features the argument for intellectual freedom offered by berninghausen above the argument which takes for granted that democracy is the most desirable form of government goes in full like this the decisions about which laws should be on the books and which policies should be adopted rest ultimately in a democracy with the electorate for the laws and policies that citizens indirectly endorse through their elected representatives to be the best possible the votes citizens cast on election day must be well informed this view in turn demands that they have access to the broadest possible array of ideas it also demands that they be able to express whatever ideas they hold dear in short democracy demands complete intellectual freedom as krug and harvey put it to stifle
 the library quarterly every nonconformist idea at birth would mark the end of the democratic process furthermore only through the constant activity of weighing and selecting can the democratic mind attain the strength demanded by times like these we need to know not only what we believe but why we believe it  p  see also pp  and  krug and harvey argue that censorship deprives the public of this opportunity and in so doing undermines democracy  p  libraries must see that users have unfettered access to all ideas however unorthodox or unpopular some may be  pp   finally no discussion of the current ala position would be complete without mention of lester asheim whose work on censorship beginning in the s has attracted considerable attention in the library literature according to asheim the librarian should seek to promote liberty of thought and to multiply points of view  p  asheim ideal is unbiased selection what the collection reflects is the librarian view of what readers and users want and need whether the librarian likes it or not but an unbiased collection is precisely what many censors disapprove of  p  the unbiased collection gives users free unrestricted access to the widest possible variety of viewpoints noxious though some of these may be to the librarian or to most people  p  asheim concedes that even with balance some groups still will not be satisfied either they will want to censor some aspect of the collection or they will object that it is biased  p  but as long as mechanisms are in place to ensure that librarians get as close to the ideal of balance as possible they are beyond reproach asheim concludes  librarians responsibility is the defense of access to ideas to information esthetic pleasure    and to knowledge or at least to the process that leads to knowledge  p  moral theory and intellectual freedom to put the debate about library censorship fully in context i would like to look at the theoretical basis of the case against censorship generally and since the debate about library censorship is fundamentally a debate about the morality of censorship i would like to look briefly at the moral theory that underlies the debate in particular i will discuss the two general forms of moral theory utilitarianism and deontology utilitarianism utilitarians hold that moral theory is the search for a first principle distinguishing right acts from wrong acts in other words moral theory attempts to identify a characteristic that all morally correct behavior
intellectual freedom  has in common on the one hand and that all morally incorrect behavior shares on the other hand the principle that the utilitarian identifies is the principle of utility or the greatest happiness principle all utilitarians are consequentialists like other consequentialists the utilitarian holds that all actions practices policies rules or laws are to be judged morally speaking in terms of their consequences that is their effects so between or among two or more mutually exclusive actions or policies for example cheat or do not cheat permit or do not permit censorship the utilitarian will claim that the right action or policy is the one that among available alternatives has the best consequences where consequences extend indefinitely see  p  what makes one set of consequences better than another so called classical utilitarians have answered net happiness that is total happiness over total unhappiness one set of consequences is better than another to the extent that it contains more net happiness or utility than the other and when determining which set of possible consequences contains the most net happiness we must give equal consideration to all affected that is to say each individual counts for one and no individual counts for more than one see  p   p  rather than maximizing happiness some more recent utilitarians have talked about maximizing the satisfaction of desires or preferences since these can be more readily tested see  p   p  and  p  but these utilitarians agree in substance with the classical utilitarians that consequences alone are relevant to assessing moral rightness and wrongness and that equal weight must be given to the interests of all affected by a given action this discussion will ignore the differences between the two varieties of the theory a major advantage of utilitarianism is that it seems to come close to the ordinary sense of right and wrong to capture accurately the way that most people generally think about morality take rape most societies sternly condemn and severely punish the act because of the great harm that it does to its victims and because of the general fear that it tends to induce in other words it is proscribed because of its devastating consequences likewise when legislators debate a bill nearly always the discussion centers on the likely consequences of the proposed legislation supporters will typically contend ingenuously or notthat passing the bill will have better consequences than not passing it critics will deny this the parties are not disagreeing about a fundamental moral principle both ostensibly agree that the bill must be judged in the light of the goodness or badness of its probable consequences instead their disagreement is empirical they disagree about the likely consequences of the bill if enacted in short they are reasoning in a utilitarian manner
 the library quarterly another advantage of utilitarianism as jonathan glover points out is that it replaces arbitrary seeming moral rules by a morality with a single basis  p  in other words particular moral rules the moral rules we are taught as children should be derivable from the most general moral rule maximize net happiness in short the principle of utility seems to provide an answer to such questions as hy is it wrong to lie or break promises  p  otherwise the resolution of moral questions is likely to be left to intuition which is notoriously unreliable at resolving moral conflict intuitions are often little more than veiled moral prejudices moreover they often contradict one another  p  for instance intuition might suggest that it is always wrong to sacrifice an innocent life for the general welfare but it might also be prepared to countenance war in some circumstances and war always means the sacrifice of innocent lives the second advantage leads to a third namely that the principle of utility provides a means of resolving conflicts between or among more specific moral rules in a given situation the ultimate court being the principle of utility itself assume that the only way to prevent great harm is to tell a lie and conversely that telling the truth would cause great harm the utilitarian will say that the apparent conflict here is a function of our ignorance the correct choice is the one that maximizes net happiness or the satisfaction of preferences and there is always a fact of the matter about this so if the only way to save someone life from a deranged ax wielder is to tell the latter a lie by all means tell it more to the current point suppose there is a conflict between allowing unfettered free expression and the successful prosecution of a morally justified war again the utilitarian would say that one must look carefully at the probable consequences of having some measure of censorship just enough to win the war and the probable consequences of having no censorship whatsoever and then choose the alternative that will most likely maximize happiness where equal consideration is given to all affected by the policy notice that intuition does not help much here the more general attraction of utilitarianism is that it satisfactorily answers the question why have moral rules at all the short answer is to promote happiness more elaborately only by having such rules only by having a code of conduct that all are expected to follow can we have the degree of security and cooperation necessary for social life and there is more net happiness when human beings live cooperatively than when they go it alone utilitarianism also satisfactorily answers the question which set of moral values ought we to embrace the set that maximizes net happiness what other grounds the utilitarian will ask could be more reasonable for deciding which moral rules
intellectual freedom  should be followed and encoded into law so whether some censorship should be tolerated comes down to whether or not that policy will maximize net happiness deontology despite the great surface appeal of utilitarianism many have rejected it and have embraced its rival deontology deontologists maintain that consequences alone do not determine the moral rightness or wrongness of an action  p  some deontologists go so far as to claim that consequences have nothing to do with morality but i will ignore that extreme position here many deontologists are prepared to concede that consequences can be relevant to rightness and wrongness although as deontologists they must deny that rightness and wrongness are solely a function of the goodness or badness of consequences an action can be right even if it does not produce at least as much good as the available alternatives most deontologists have argued that other considerations besides consequences are relevant to rightness or wrongness for instance the type of act in question so when i make a promise for example the deontologist will claim that i am generally bound to keep it simply in virtue of its being a promise and not because keeping it will promote slightly more well being than not keeping it in other words i lay myself under a special obligation to the promisee and i am not released from that obligation just because slightly more net happiness might accrue to breaking the promise there are other considerations besides consequences that are morally relevant in this case chiefly that i have made a promise see  pp     deontology and rights a central contention of most deontologists and one directly relevant to censorship is that persons have rights and that these rights obtain independently of whether restricting them has better consequences than allowing persons to exercise them in other words the moral status of a right does not depend solely on the consequences of persons exercising it as jonathan glover points out the deontological view of rights is that the case respecting them does not depend on the good consequences of doing so in pursuing our goals we should respect in an absolute way certain limitations on what we can do to people  p  can rights be limited it depends on the right and the deontologist says ronald dworkin a leading contemporary defender of rights rights may   be absolute a political theory which holds a right to  for a slightly stricter interpretation of deontology see  p 
 the library quarterly free speech as absolute will recognize no reason for not securing the liberty it requires for every individual no reason that is short of impossibility rights may also be less than absolute one principle might have to yield to another or even to an urgent policy with which it competes on particular facts we may define the weight of a right assuming that it is not absolute as its power to withstand such competition  p  dworkin goes on to distinguish rights in this sense from the notion of a morally correct act generally to say that people have a right to do something is not to imply that it would always be morally right for them to do it rather we mean that it would be wrong to interfere with their doing it or at least some special grounds are needed for justifying any interference  p  for instance if you have a right to free speech i have a corresponding obligation not to interfere with your exercise of it so the rights based case for unconditional free speech would no doubt be prepared to concede that it might be wrong for neo nazis to post a hate site on the internet however it would hasten to affirm their absolute right to do so and insist that it would be wrong for authorities to prevent them from doing so in short someone may have the right to do something that is the wrong thing for him to do  p  deontologists have also envisaged rights as a bulwark against tyranny we have certain moral rights that it would be wrong for the government to infringe even in the absence of legal protection  p  dworkin again the claim that citizens have a right to free speech must imply that it would be wrong for the government to stop them from speaking even when the government believes that what they will say will cause more harm than good if citizens have the moral right to free speech then the government would do wrong to repeal the first amendment that guarantees it  pp   to recur to an earlier example suppose the government believes correctly and on the best evidence that utility would be increased by censoring criticism of how the government is waging a morally justified war the deontological defender of the moral right to free speech is bound to say that the increase in utility alone does not justify the measure when individuals are said to have rights against the government    like the right to free speech that must mean that this sort of utilitarian justification is not enough  p  there are some rights that cannot be infringed merely to increase net happiness this view means that the principle of utility cannot be the most fundamental moral rule after all which is to say that utilitarianism must be false an influential rights based criticism of utilitarianism comes from john rawls rawls believes that rights are the upshot of a hypothetical agreement he asks us to imagine a group of people who have gathered
intellectual freedom  together to decide on their basic rights and duties as well as how benefits and burdens will be distributed  pp    in order to ensure that the principles that the contractors agree on are the correct ones that is that they embodyjustice rawls insists that the group conduct their deliberations under a veil of ignorance which ensures epistemic equality this veil prevents the contractors from knowing their sex sexual preference race ethnicity natural abilities class wealth or even the generation to which they belong  p  thus those behind the veil are unable wittingly to bias the principles in their favor the veil ensures that the principles are chosen fairly  pp     and   rawls contends that the contractors will unanimously embrace two basic principles that are to regulate all further agreements  and that will assign basic rights and duties and  determine the division of social benefits  p   these principles he calls the principles of justice only the first the equality principle concerns us here the equality principle which assigns basic rights and duties has priority over the second principle the difference principle which relates to how for instance wealth and authority should be distributed  pp   the equality principle states that each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others  p  see also pp   the basic liberties encompassed by the equality principle include freedom of speech and assembly liberty of conscience and freedom of thought  p  these rights cannot be sacrificed for a greater gain of utility  pp  by contrast states rawls for the utilitarian there is no reason in principle why the greater gains of some should not compensate for the lesser losses of others or more importantly why the violation of liberty of a few might not be made right by the greater good shared by many  p  rawls however is persuaded that the contractors deliberating behind the veil of ignorance would insist on the guarantees of the equality principle and require that they not be compromised utilitarianly for this reason rawls declares utilitarianism inconsistent with the demands of justice and thus unacceptable as a moral theory although other deontologists arrive at their conclusions differently all fundamentally agree with this last point that the extent of intellectual freedom cannot be decided by considerations of utility alone the deontological critique of the utilitarian position on intellectual freedom diana woodward rightly notes that one can give both consequentialist and deontological arguments for intellectual freedom but the choice  see  pp  and  for the general knowledge that they will possess
 the library quarterly of an ethical theory upon which intellectual freedom is based can result in different decisions about what ought to be done in particular cases  p  again deontologists like rawls have rejected utilitarian defenses of intellectual freedom because these defenses rest on the vagaries of consequences by contrast as we have seen a deontological theory of rights holds that individuals have them independently of the consequences of their possession  p  woodward sums up the utilitarian defense of intellectual freedom in the following way to defend intellectual freedom on consequentialist grounds one must make the case that it is for the best   if information is broadly disseminated  p  that is utilitarians opposed to censorship must contend that overall well being increases the more broadly all types of information are disseminated and the greater the degree of access to this information this of course is not to defend intellectual freedom in principle or for its own sake but rather to defend it for the sake of increasing net happiness she points out that to defend intellectual freedom in principle and not merely in those cases where it can be shown to benefit someone one needs to provide a deontological defense of intellectual freedom  p  woodward concludes that deontological defenses of intellectual freedom are safer than consequentialist defenses for the former do not rest on the probable consequences of a policy of complete intellectual freedom david ward explicitly defends intellectual freedom deontologically claiming that such a defense takes precedence over consequentialist and thus utilitarian defenses  p  ward position is the familiar one that utilitarianism makes insufficient provision for considerations of rights and justice  p  the point is that the utilitarian would have to endorse a violation of someone rights or countenance an injustice if doing so maximized utility ward pronounces this objection sound rights take precedence over utility thus deontological theories take precedence over consequentialist theories  p  people are entitled to intellectual freedom an entitlement that in no way depends on the consequences of the exercise of this freedom in short intellectual freedom is a right  p  only a rights based deontological defense of intellectual freedom can give ward his desired unconditional principle according to which all forms of expression are permissible his example is pornography he writes that the case against pornography is often couched in utilitarian language those who have wanted to ban it have typically tried to show that it causes great harm including sexual violence and other undesirable sexual behavior  p  and that these negative effects outweigh any benefits that might accrue to its unfettered production and distribution but ward continues the consequentialist opponents of pornography
intellectual freedom  were sic in a very weak position for not only were their claims about the effects of pornography contentious and controversial but even if the alleged bad consequences were shown to result from pornography it would not follow that it was permissible to ban it the exercise of one s rights does not depend on the felicitousness of the consequences of that exercise  p  ward gives an admirably clear statement of a deontological interpretation of rights it is clear too on why many deontologists think that the right to intellectual freedom does not depend on the consequences of its exercise to claim that the right of free expression for example depends on whether its exercise will lead to more good than its abridgement is to miss the very meaning of intellectual freedom to be prepared to limit intellectual freedom in deference to utility is not to value intellectual freedom for its own sake at all thus the utilitarian defense of intellectual freedom fails if we embrace the notion of intellectual freedom we must accept it on deontological grounds or not at all how extensive is our right to freedom of expression according to ward he rests his position on the distinction between positive and negative rights only negative rights are genuine so called positive rights like the alleged right to a job require others to take positive steps toward providing the right holder with the object of the right  p  and requiring others to take this action might violate some of their negative rights like the right to dispose of their honestly gotten gains as they see fit negative rights however make no such demands they only require that others not interfere with the right holder exercise of that right  p  freedom of expression is such a right by exercising the negative right to free expression one is only requiring others not to interfere one is not requiring others to take any positive action on one behalf  p  ward distinction appears to amount to this to say that intellectual freedom is a negative right is to say that by expressing myself freely and by investigating those lines of thought that i choose i make no demands on others their right to do the same is not infringed in other words i am morally entitled to behave in this way i am morally free to express whatever ideas i like or to investigate all ideas of others by the same token others have a moral obligation not to interfere with my intellectual freedom however others do not have a moral obligation to provide me with the means of free expression if i cannot afford to produce and disseminate my ideas or if i cannot get someone else to do it willingly says ward freedom of expression is the right not to have one speech coercively interfered with it is not the right to be provided with the resources necessary to produce and distribute speech freedom of the press in other words is not the right to be
 the library quarterly provided with a printing press but only the right not to have others interfere with the operation of one press  p  at the end of his article ward broaches the question of what all this means for the selection policies of public libraries and by implication of state supported academic libraries since the public supports these libraries should it also be able to decide what lines their shelves ward thinks that it should  p  no one rights are violated by removing a given text from a publicly funded library presumably patrons can buy the text themselves if they choose so their negative right of access to the ideas of others is not violated and of course authors have no right that their books appear in libraries to make his case he appeals to the controversy of the late s and early s concerning the national endowment for the arts and its support of exhibitions by artists robert mapplethorpe and andres serrano deemed indecent mapplethorpe and blasphemous serrano by their detractors the taxpayers are exercising their acknowledged right to decide what they will and will not support just as in the mapplethorpeserrano case and the librarian if he or she is to remain in that position must acknowledge the public right to be selective about what it wants in libraries it pays for  p  the most the librarian can do in these cases is to remonstrate with the public when for example a large part of it insists that certain works be removed from the collection likewise by implication with regard to the current clamor regarding the installation of blocking software on computers with internet access for although the taxpayers are not financing say the pornographic sites accessed by patrons they are footing the bill for the computers and the software needed to run them here ward concedes that utilitarian considerations are relevant librarians might employ utilitarian arguments to persuade patrons that the consequences of removing these books or installing blocking software will actually be worse than the alternatives but again ultimately libraries should not override taxpayers right to determine the contents of libraries the latter finance concluding ward puts the distinction this way utilitarian counter arguments fail against arguments based on justice or rights this precedence however must not serve as a motive for attempting to turn all that is desirable into a right that is by turning positive rights into negative rights the inflation of rights by conflating the merely desirable with the obligatory that is the conflating of positive rights with negative rights dilutes the rights which protect us all  pp     nor for that matter do others have an obligation to provide one with access to ideas  ward sounds like a utilitarian here
intellectual freedom  so ward would allow the public to determine the acquisition and access policies of publicly supported libraries this view raises the question just when do taxpayers have the right to remove a text or to have blocking software installed when a majority decides two thirds three quarters no obvious answer presents itself and ward himself offers no help and how do we know when the threshold is reached let us assume that a majority suffices and that we can determine when one obtains though of course this latter will be no easy matter suppose that  percent plus one decide to remove all books by jewish authors from the local public library would it be within its rights to do so ward must say yes notice that he is then prepared to permit the caprice of the majority to determine which ideas and images can find their way into our libraries an odd claim for one who contends that freedom of expression and access are basic rights this view means that on ward position the public could be greatly limited in its access to the literature of minority cultures or unpopular ideas at least when it comes to publicly supported libraries to continue the case suppose the next day that two people in the community change their minds does this change of mind mean that the previously removed literature must immediately be reinstalled i defer to ward a final point against ward he takes a liberal position on pornography he takes it to be an advantage of his position that in contrast to utilitarianism his defense of pornography does not depend on the effects of its production and distribution to repeat a quote the consequentialist opponents of pornography were in a weak position for not only were their claims about the effects of pornography contentious and controversial but even if the alleged bad consequences were shown to result from pornography it would not follow that it was permissible to ban it the exercise of one rights does not depend on the felicitousness of the consequences of that exercise  p  ward is not entirely fair to the utilitarian here he implies that the utilitarian is committed to the following if pornography has bad consequences then we should ban it not necessarily the clear headed utilitarian will agree with ward that the mere fact that pornography might cause some harm does not imply that we should ban it any more than the fact that open heart surgery causes some harm means that we should outlaw that procedure what we would need to know the utilitarian would urge is that banning pornography would prevent more harm and thus promote more good than not banning it if this determination is the case then utilitarianism endorses a ban otherwise not unfortunately this information is hard to come by suppose though for the sake of discussion that all sexually violent criminals have enjoyed pornography that depicts women in degrading roles d for
 the library quarterly short is this a utilitarian reason for banning all pornography no all d likely not first what if the vast majority of people who are exposed to d never perpetrate violence against women or anyone else second we would need to establish more than a correlation between watching d videos and perpetrating sexual violence a correlation alone fails to show that d is part of the cause let alone the whole cause third how do we devise effective criteria for identifying d and how do we ensure that these criteria are correctly applied and fourth a legal ban on d could induce black markets leading perhaps to turf wars among syndicates of pornography dealers much like the drug wars that have plagued our inner cities for decades by way of analogy no one seriously considers reenacting prohibition just because some abuse alcohol and drive drunk as with alcohol the potential benefits of banning any kind of pornography must be weighed along with the potential costs and a decision about what to do must be made in the light of the best available evidence only then can we pass informed judgment about whether we should ban any type of pornography and if so what type just as most assume that the harm done by a second episode of prohibition would vastly outweigh any good that it would bring so a considerable opus would be on the censor to justify banning some types of pornography ward then misconstrues utilitarianism when he implies that the utilitarian would consider banning pornography simply if it were discovered to cause some harm from the utilitarian perspective the issue is far more complex however ward own position is different from this entirely he implies that even if we knew that banning certain types of pornography would have more felicitous consequences than not banning it its production and distribution should still never be legally restricted such a position is surely monstrous for instance suppose that we knew that by banning pornography in the united states we could prevent on average  murders and  rapes a year utilitarians would insist that this carnage and violence is far too much to pay for unqualified free expression safely assuming that the murders and rapes are not offset by some greater benefit the value of freedom of expression must ultimately be cashed out in terms of its overall benefits not in terms of certain negative rights that all persons allegedly possess if we could be sure that a type of expression was seriously inimical to half the population that it carried no compensating benefits and that it could be banned with few repercussions then we should ban it producing and looking at d is in principle no different from any other potentially harmful type of behavior like reckless driving or polluting groundwater any position that denies this has gone badly wrong but it is difficult to see how a rights based defense of freedom of expression
intellectual freedom  like ward could justify such a ban without a utilitarian appeal that is without abandoning rights at least conceived of as unconditional thus a utilitarian position on intellectual and expressive freedom and censorship seems the only satisfactory way to justify intellectual freedom and to oppose all types of censorship it is to this kind of analysis that i now turn the utilitarian case for intellectual freedom this section will begin by contrasting the utilitarian conception of rights with the deontological conception then i will look at mill case for intellectual freedom finally i will discuss the limits of mill position utilitarianism and rights the utilitarian rejects the notion of rights conceived of as independent of utility disclaiming any moral principle or rule not grounded in utility see  p  says mill it is proper to state that i forego any advantage which could be derived to my argument from the idea of abstract right as a thing independent of utility i regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions  p  we saw above in the context of dworkin discussion that rights can either be absolute or less than absolute take absolute or unconditional rights first actually there can be but one since it must trump all others in conflicts suppose that the one absolute right is the right to free expression and access to the expression of others this one absolute right must obtain come what may even when no good comes from its exercise even when great harm follows in its wake this the utilitarian will say is unacceptable as we saw in the preceding section how morally speaking can we possibly defend a right that if acknowledged leads to more suffering and less happiness than if it were abridged what could possibly recommend it also why is the right to free expression and not say the right to life or property the one absolute right for the utilitarian the choice seems completely arbitrary lacking rational justification rights then if there are any must be conditional less than absolute in a passage quoted above dworkin concedes though that if rights are conditional one principle might have to yield to another or even to an urgent policy with which it competes on particular facts we may define the weight of a right assuming that it is not absolute as its power to withstand such competition  p  but how are we to determine the relative weights of conflicting rights in a given circumstance it is difficult to see how this can be done in a noncircular way
 the library quarterly without appealing to utility otherwise the notion of a right weight remains occult invoked merely out of caprice or inclination so the utilitarian rejects any defense of intellectual freedom that rests on an alleged right to freedom of expression or freedom of access to all available lines of thought when utilitarians have defended freedom of expression or when they have opposed censorship they have done so because they have been convinced that happiness is increased through there being more room for self expression  p  in other words they have supposed that complete intellectual or expressive freedom will more likely conduce to human well being than will permitting restrictions however minor on that freedom although utilitarians reject deontological rights they will likely favor legal protections that guarantee something akin to the rights of dworkin or rawls equality principle but these guarantees will of course be utilitarian deontologists then have a point when they claim that in a given case it may turn out that there are even stronger utilitarian reasons for restricting expression than for permitting it see  p  specifically the utilitarian must concede that if we could demonstrate that certain restrictions on expression would produce more net happiness than their absence then these restrictions would be morally required on utilitarian grounds however i will try to show that utilitarians need never endorse censorship in practice and can actually support strong legal proscriptions of it mill position the case presented here derives largely from chapter  ofjohn stuart mill on liberty  as a utilitarian mill contends that practices and public policies are acceptable from the moral point of view to the extent that they promote general happiness more specifically a policy or practice is the morally correct one if and only if it promotes more overall or net happiness than any available alternative policy or practice otherwise it is wrong and ought to be rejected mill utilitarian opposition to censorship and his support of intellectual freedom begins by connecting general happiness with the acquisition of truth the higher the proportion of true beliefs to false beliefs that society has the better off it generally will be the truth of an opinion is part of its utility if we would know whether or not it is desirable that a proposition should be believed is it possible to exclude the consideration of whether or not it is true    no belief which is contrary to truth can really be useful  p  in other words false beliefs although perhaps temporarily useful will eventually let us down that is will have less utility than true beliefs consider for instance this country financial and intellectual devotion to physical
intellectual freedom  science it assumes first that science is a reliable way to get at the truth and second it strongly testifies to our conviction that the more true beliefs we have the better off we are by truth i and i think mill too mean well truth that is i mean nothing esoteric or tendentious nothing that needs to be cradled by scare quotes or qualified in any way to paraphrase bishop butler truth is what is and not another thing when i use the word i am not claiming an inside track on it unfortunately it is easier to say what it is not than what it is it is not a social construct something relative to conceptual schemes era gender sexual preference race or ethnicity neither is it an instrument of capitalist or colonial oppression nor is it the dominant ideology of a culture or relative to languages or social formations  p  truth is the chief property people take their beliefs to have even though some are doubtless false and as soon as a person takes a belief to be false she renounces it to say that a statement is true is to say that it correctly describes the world for example that the universe is many billions of years old that the earth is approximately  millions miles from the sun or that snow is white and the world is the way it is independently of how we think of it or describe it i believe unfashionably perhaps that science is the best road to truth assuming that truth and utility are part and parcel the question becomes what is the best way to promote truth mill response was open and unfettered discussion  pp  and  both with regard to how our political and social lives ought to be conducted that is the legal and moral rules that society should uphold and with respect to the laws of nature that physical science attempts to discover all ideas even the most offensive preposterous or potentially injurious must be countenanced we must permit even those opinions that seem forever beyond controversy to be subjected to the criticism of all gainsayers  p  and the criticism of all values even fundamental ones must be tolerated only then can we have any reasonable assurance that we are approaching the truth or that the values accepted by society are the values that it ought to accept that is are those values adherence to which in fact promotes the greatest sum of happiness and this of course implies that censorship of ideas is never justified notice though that mill is not claiming that unfettered discussion guarantees truth his point is rather that our beliefs are only warranted orjusti alan ryan rightly offers the following caveat mill argues for an almost absolute freedom to say what we please outside those situations where we would cause immediate unjustifiable damage in american law this is often referred to as the rule that we should not shout ire in a crowded theater unless there really is a fire and the damage done by the ensuing panic is less than the damage that would be done by the fire  p xxix
 the library quarterly fied insofar as they have been subjected to such debate and the better warranted the better reason we have for thinking them true the beliefs which we have the most warrant for have no safeguard to rest on but a standing invitation to the whole world to prove them unfounded if the challenge is not accepted or is accepted and the attempt fails we are far from certainty still but we have done the best that the existing state of human reason admits of we have neglected nothing that could give truth a chance of reaching us  p  in sum censorship inhibits the emergence of truth and inhibiting the emergence of truth undermines overall happiness any practice or policy that undermines overall happiness ought to be rejected therefore censorship ought to be rejected mill proceeds to offer three reasons that any degree of censorship obstructs truth the first is that the suppressed opinion may be true however absurd or pernicious it might initially seem mill reminds his readers that no age is infallible every age having held many opinions which subsequent ages have deemed not only false but absurd and it is as certain that many opinions now general will be rejected by future ages as it is that many once general are rejected by the present  p  examples of opinions once widely or universally accepted but now entirely discredited or generally rejected include the belief that infectious disease is communicated by evil spirits that the earth is at the center of the universe that the universe is only a few thousand years old and that there is nothing wrong with enslaving others who are racially or ethnically different from oneself examples could obviously be multiplied in fact it does not matter if only one person subscribes to the opinion in question even then censorship would be wrong if all mankind minus one were of one opinion and only one person were of the contrary opinion mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he if he had the power would be justified in silencing mankind  p  censorship in any form deprives everyone of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth  p  this sentiment is echoed by krug and harvey censorship denies the opportunity to choose from all possible alternatives and thereby violates intellectual freedom the library profession has aimed to ensure every individual freedom of the mind so that society as a whole benefits  p xxi john swan makes a similar point when he claims that it is the librarian job to provide access not to truth but to the fruit of human com at the end of chapter  of on liberty  p  when he is summing up mill claims that he has offered four reasons but the third and fourth reasons he offers there he treats as one reason earlier
intellectual freedom  munication not to reality but to multiple representations thereof  p  mill second argument concedes that many candidates for censorship are known to be false he could have added that they might also be malign even then though the ideas should not be suppressed for only if true or valuable ideas are rigorously tested against false or pernicious ideas can people come to know why the former are true or valuable if a true opinion is never criticized the reasons for holding it will go unappreciated however true it may be if it is not fully frequently and fearlessly discussed it will be held as a dead dogma not a living truth even if the received opinion be not only true but the whole truth unless it is suffered to be and actually is vigorously and earnestly contested it will by most of those who receive it be held in the manner of a prejudice with little comprehension or feeling of its rational grounds  pp   accepted true beliefs must be regularly challenged if only by a devil advocate so that the good reasons for holding them do not fall by the wayside and thus cease to have a positive effect on behavior without such challenges the meaning of the doctrine itself will be in danger of being lost or enfeebled and deprived of its vital effect on the character and conduct the dogma becoming a mere formal profession inefficacious for good  p  the great danger is that if the impact of important truths is lost in this way the field is open for dangerous falsehoods john swan has made this point much more recently in the context of the duty of librarians the librarian duty is as much to preserve the untruth on the shelves as truth librarians are committed both to the search for truth and the expression of untruth  pp   why because it is vital that we recognize the place of untruth in helping us to get at the truth  p  the implications that mill second argument has for censorship generally and for library censorship particularly should be clear the standing invitation  p  to criticism referred to above assumes that all opinions and doctrines even the true ones should be open to the severest possible criticism consider the literature of holocaust denial most people believe that the principal thesis of this body of work is false and i agree nevertheless by mill lights such work should have a place in our libraries this literature should be readily available though not because those who produce it have some inherent right to promote their false doctrine as the deontologist would contend rather libraries should acquire it because making it available allows others to set the record straight by exposing its purveyors as virulent anti semites and by demonstrating that their research is deeply suspect it also gives society an opportunity to think more generally
 the library quarterly about what distinguishes sound historical research from sham exercises mill third argument against any form of censorship is that even when the heterodox idea is mostly mistaken it may still contain part of the truth and by allowing it to be expressed and criticized we stand a better chance of uncovering its kernel of truth or take a fundamentally true received idea that might be a bit off the mark here again vigorous debate is indispensable so that the idea might be further corrected in mill own words we have hitherto considered only two possibilities that the received opinion may be false and some other opinion consequently true or that the received opinion being true a conflict with the opposite error is essential to a clear apprehension and deep feeling of its truth but there is a commoner case than either of these when conflicting doctrines instead of being one true and the other false share the truth between them and the nonconforming opinion is needed to supply the remainder of the truth of which the received doctrine embodies only a part  p  mill likens this situation to the necessary elements of a healthy political life which he thinks requires vigorous parties on both the right and the left  p  he proceeds to argue that in the great social debates about how wealth should be distributed or how consenting adults should be allowed to conduct their private lives it is essential that the minority viewpoint not merely be tolerated but encouraged and countenanced for that is the opinion which for the time being represents the neglected interests the side of human well being which is in danger of obtaining less than its share  p  it is easy to extend mill position uncensored libraries are needed because it is precisely books and periodicals representing minority viewpoints that are less likely to be published by large houses and thus less likely to find their way into bookstore chains and newsstands where inventories are market driven the burden is on librarians to seek out minority viewpoints energetically for these viewpoints might otherwise be overlooked similarly librarians also have a responsibility to identify reliable web sites presenting unpopular or controversial ideas limits of mill position unfortunately mill arguments if successful show only that censorship of ideas is wrong they do not do this for images a pornographic image for instance doesn obviously say anything let alone something true or false nor for that matter does pornographic prose necessarily have a truth value so it looks like mill position at least as expressed in  there is yet another reason to be discussed in the conclusion
intellectual freedom  chapter  of on liberty will not help nor does the argument from democracy do much good here it is not obvious that producing or having access to pornographic images with impunity is necessary for an electorate to arrive at informed decisions about the great social issues of the day or to determine where the candidates stand with regard to these issues though one could argue that in order for the electorate to make rational decisions about censoring pornographic internet sites say it would have to have a clear idea of the potential object of censorship nevertheless utilitarians can plausibly defend complete freedom of expression and access here remember that utilitarians judge actions or policies as right to the extent that they produce happiness or satisfy people desires well dirty pictures like it or not do this for many prohibiting their publication or people access to them can be justified if and only if doing so prevents more unhappiness or promotes greater satisfaction of desires than permitting their publication and access this of course is an empirical question one way in which certain types of pornography might cause harm is through exploitation of its subjects that pornography sometimes exploits those who feature in it no utilitarian would want to deny still less would he or she want to deny that such exploitation is morally bad but then this exploitation should be handled like any other kind there is nothing special about its sexual nature society should do all that it can consistent with increasing utility to alleviate or abolish all exploitation sexual or otherwise so take the class of all pornography that involves no exploitation it now becomes more difficult to see what harm this kind of material does although this is still an empirical question surely the burden should be on those who would do the banning to show not only that pornography does harm but that banning it would do less harm putting aside the question of how minors should be treated maybe we ought to think of pornography roughly as we think of alcohol as suggested above in criticizing ward alcohol does much mischief nevertheless we rightly allow adults to drink punishing them for abuses that could potentially seriously harm others for example drunk driving but most people manage to drink responsibly and are no worse off for having the legal right to do so in fact most might even be slightly better off because utility accrues to letting people make such choices conclusion who would do the censoring many might still feel uneasy about the utilitarian defense of intellectual freedom since it is subordinate to the principle of utility as we have
 the library quarterly seen cases can be envisaged in which the suppression of a particular work conduces to the general happiness and thus seems to be required on utilitarian grounds surely this position gravely imperils the utilitarian case or so the objection goes i don think that it does utilitarians need not insist that we apply the utilitarian calculus case by case in fact there are solid utilitarian grounds for not doing so for treating the conditional prohibition on censorship as if it were absolute see  p   pp   here why legally sanctioned censorship assumes to begin with that legislators could fashion laws that specified consistent with the principle of utility just what should be censored assuming for the sake of discussion that this could be done we would then need to repose faith in someone or in a committee to execute the law empowering a few to make up the minds of the vast majority this in turn implies both that the committee could determine just when censorship would maximize utility and that it would impose restrictions in just those cases it is unlikely that both conditions will ever be met this is the core of the utilitarian case for intellectual and expressive freedom censors then to paraphrase mill presume to settle controversial questions for others without allowing those others to hear what the opposition has to say  p  and who gets to make these decisions in denouncing religious censorship in an  letter thomasjefferson famously raised this question and in so doing anticipated mill are we to have a censor whose imprimatur shall say what books may be sold and what we may buy and who is thus to dogmatize religious opinions for our citizens whose foot is to be the measure to which ours are all to be cut or stretched is a priest to be our inquisitor or shall a layman similar to ourselves set up his reason as the rule for what we are to read and what we must believe it is an insult to our citizens to question whether they are rational beings or not and blasphemy against religion to suppose it cannot stand the test of truth and reason if a book or idea be false in its facts disprove them if false in its reasoning refute it but for god sake let us freely hear both sides the censor might genuinely be animated by a concem for the common good just as conscientious parents are committed to their children best interests no doubt many of the paternalistic librariancensors prior to the s were motivated to do good however the assumption that the censor is in a better position than the rest of us to decide which ideas or images are so harmful that they ought to be kept out of circulation is misguided and this is where the parent child  i would like to thank an anonymous referee for raising this problem so clearly  quoted by david berninghausen at the beginning of his article history of the intellectual freedom committee wilson library bulletin  june    jefferson quotation also appears in geller article  p 
intellectual freedom  analogy fails whenever someone has this kind of discretion however well intentioned he or she may be the possibility of abuse is considerable what is to prevent the censor from screening ideas or images not because they are genuinely pernicious as some no doubt are but because she does not happen to like them these are two different matters or perhaps the censor will be pressured to keep certain information out of circulation and even if the censor is actuated by a desire to promote the common good what guarantee does the general public have that she will not sometimes be mistaken about where that good lies and thus about what should be suppressed this incidentally is another reason why even holocaust denial literature ought to be in our libraries the recent controversy about blocking software on library computers with internet access is also relevant here first there is the question of who gets to decide which types of content should blocked and second even if from a utilitarian perspective we could determine what should be jammed we face a further challenge namely writing software that blocks all and only undesirable sites there is one more reason why utilitarians should insist that censorship be legally proscribed and thus that we not appeal to the principle of utility case by case to decide what can be said seen or read for intellectual freedom to be genuine people must have the confidence that they will not be harassed for what they publish or seek out only an atmosphere of legally guaranteed intellectual freedom can foster this confidence again as ward and woodward rightly note the utilitarian position against censorship is not unconditional the utilitarian will concede that some things would be better left unexpressed unpublished unseen and unread the trouble is we cannot know beforehand precisely which set of ideas or images if published would do more harm than good in presuming to know this much that is useful although initially shocking might also get banned think for instance of someone in the nineteenth century advocating greatly loosening the restrictions on divorce insisting that couples ought to live together before marriage or arguing that homosexuals should have precisely the same legal rights as heterosexuals utilitarians point to the fact that the history of censorship is littered with examples of suppressed prose and banned art that today we would never think of censoring that indeed we recognize as making signal scientific social or artistic contributions no doubt succeeding generations will shake their heads incredulously over much that irks today bowdlerizers and obscurantists and as the historical section above was intended to show librarians have often been willing to play the censor themselves however even if we did have the  see  pp   for a similar point in the context of punishment
 the library quarterly means of determining for any given set of ideas or images whether its publication would do more harm than its suppression who could say that we would always censor just that set what is true of censorship generally is true of censorship in libraries particularly of course with regard to print libraries like bookstores must wait upon the decisions of publishers but libraries even more than bookstores are in a position to provide the broadest possible range of ideas the newest threat to freedom of access in libraries is the use or implementation of internet filters these too run contrary to the position defended in this article as well as at least the spirit of the ala position they must be the next target of all proponents of intellectual and expressive freedom references  woodward diana introduction library trends  summerfall     ward david philosophical issues in censorship and intellectual freedom library trends  summerfall     mill john stuart on libety edited by david spitz new york norton   office for intellectual freedom of the american library association library bill of rights in the intellectualfreedom manual th ed compiled by the office for intellectual freedom of the american library association pp   chicago american library association   office for intellectual freedom of the american library association the freedom to read in the intellectual freedom manual th ed compiled by the office for intellectual freedom of the american library association pp   chicago american library association   office for intellectual freedom of the american library association intelectual freedom manual th ed compiled by the office for intellectual freedom of the american library association chicago american library association   krug judith f and harvey james a ala and intellectual freedom an historical overview in intelectual freedom manual th ed compiled by the office for intellectual freedom of the american library association pp xix xlvi chicago american library association   wiegand wayne an active instrument for propaganda the american public library during world war i new york greenwood   geller evelyn intellectual freedom eternal principle or unanticipated consequence library journal  may      heckart ronald j the library as a marketplace of ideas colege and research libraries  november     swanjohn lntellectual freedom in theencyclopedia of libraty history edited by wayne wiegand and donald g davis pp   new york garland   richard darling access intellectual freedom and libraries library trends  winter     fujimoto jan dee representing a document viewpoint in library collections a theme of obligation and resistance library resources and technical senices  january
