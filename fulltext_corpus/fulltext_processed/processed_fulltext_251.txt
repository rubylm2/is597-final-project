the impact of unions on salaries in public libraries mary rosenthal the objective of this study was to test the following hierarchical regression model a library employee salary is a function of  the size of the library  the strength of public sector collective bargaining in the state  the library ability to pay  the cost of living in the area  the presence of any union in the library and  the presence of a union representing librarians in the library the model was tested on three salary levels those of the department head the beginning librarian and the clerical worker results indicate that librarian union presence explains   percent of the variation in librarians salaries no significant amount of variation in the salaries of department heads or clerical workers is explained by librarian union presence simple union presence can explain    percent of the variation in the salaries of clerical workers simple union presence does not explain any of the variation in the salaries of librarians or department heads introduction the drives to organize unions in libraries have been part of the general drives to organize unions among workers in the united states the first library unions were formed just before  when there was a great deal of union activity in response to the postwar economy  p  the second wave of library union organizing efforts paralleled the growth of unions in the industrial sector of the economy during the s and s with the social change of the sixties and changes in legislation  this study was made possible by a grant from the university of minnesota computing center  rt  box  rensselaer falls new york  library quarterly vol  no  pp   g  by the university of chicago all rights reserved     
impact of unions on salaries  affecting public employees there came another wave of efforts to organize the librarians these organizing drives have left only one tenth of the public librarians unionized by   p  there are several explanations for this low figure first of all the majority of librarians are women and women are less frequently represented by unions than are men  librarians work within institutions where they form a small proportion of the total work force this also can hinder their organization into a collective bargaining unit there are also subjective factors that act to block efforts at unionization because librarianship carries professional status there is often a feeling that unions with their blue collar overtones are inappropriate vehicles for effecting changes for librarians the professional association has been proposed as an alternative to the union for the librarian the national education association nea functions in this way for teachers while retaining the veneer of professionalism the association engages in collective bargaining for wages fringe benefits and better working conditions as well as attending to its members professional concerns however the american library association ala the professional association for librarians has made no move in the direction of assuming that role for the librarian membership in its ranks is open not only to librarians but also to any person or organization interested in libraries and it is not likely that this stance will change  p  in the absence of a professional association turned quasi union  those public librarians who engage in collective bargaining find themselves represented by a variety of organizations such as the american federation of state county and municipal employees afscme other unions small professional associations city employee groups independent local unions and other bargaining units whether these unions have brought benefits to the employees they represent is the subject of this article problem statement the purpose of this investigation is to determine the impact of unionization on the relative wages of public library employees in seven midwestern states because other factors can influence the magnitude of wages such as the size of the library the extent of unionization in the area and the ability of the institution to pay the work force measures of these variables will also be taken to determine their impact on relative wages this study will not attempt to determine the extent to which collective bargaining units are providing for the professional concerns of the
 the library quarterly librarians they represent nor will it deal with librarians degree of satisfaction with their unions the purpose of this study is to determine whether the presence of unions that represent librarians can explain any of the variation in salaries above and beyond the variation explained by other variables literature review the number of articles written about library unions has increased over the past fifteen years this increase parallels the growth of unionization in libraries much of it is narrative either detailing various organizing drives and bargaining efforts in libraries or arguing the pros and cons of professional librarians organizing into unions three major papers have investigated the history and development of library unions in this country    five broad areas relating to library unions have been the subjects of recent research the first deals with the factors that influence the formation of library unions guyton survey determined that the formation of unions in libraries was a function of the size of the library the existence of legislation granting public employees the right to bargain collectively and the presence of trade union activity in the area  p  another area that has been researched deals with the attitudes of librarians and library school students toward collective bargaining and unions both guyton and vignone found that younger and more educated librarians did not feel that collective bargaining was unprofessional  p   p j surveys of librarians and library school students in the s revealed a fairly constant percentage   percent who would be willing to join a union if one existed in their workplace  p   p   p   p  schlachter surveys also indicated that the majority of librarians and library school students felt that the american library association should be the organization to work aggressively to better their economic and professional positions  p   p   p  members of the association of college and research libraries felt that their personal goals benefited more from collective bargaining than did their institutions goals according to a survey conducted by carmack and olsgaard  p  librarians working under collective bargaining agreements felt that their right to appeal unfair practices their salaries and their fringe benefits had improved significantly as a result of collective bargaining one area that has been only minimally investigated is the actual collective bargaining agreement and its provisions the examinations
impact of unions on salaries  that have been conducted reveal contradictory findings belli and kennedy as reported by schlachter determined that the contracts of the surveyed public and academic libraries often ignored professional goals i  p  chaplan and maxey found that both economic issues such as salaries and pensions and professional issues such as education policy and general governance were included in the agreements of surveyed institutions  another question that has just recently begun to be explored is the impact of unions on the productivity of libraries ehrenberg sherman and schwarz did not find that collective bargaining coverage had affected productivity significantly in municipal libraries except in the area of interlibrary loans where the number was greater in unionized libraries  this same study did not find that collective bargaining coverage was associated with higher wage rates however several other studies have found that unions do have an impact on the salaries and fringe benefits of library employees guyton presented evidence in his survey that the salaries of professional librarians in unionized libraries were higher than those in nonunionized libraries however the differences were not statistically significant and the fringe benefits enjoyed by both groups were similar  p  in an analysis of salary data collected by the office of public libraries and interlibrary cooperation minnesota for its  annual report i found that unionized libraries paid significantly higher salaries to librarians and clerks than did nonunion libraries significant at the  level the number of paid sick days and paid holidays received by librarians was also significantly higher in unionized than in nonunionized libraries  level  however the number of libraries studied was less than the recommended sixty for the t test also factors other than union presence may have accounted for some of the wage and fringe benefit differences getz survey of thirty one of the largest public library systems in the united states while admittedly not a random sample demonstrated that libraries with collective bargaining agreements did pay statistically significant higher salaries than libraries without such agreements to employees in two specific job categories the beginning clerical worker and the experienced librarian the wage differentials found were  percent and  percent respectively no statistically significant wage differential was found to exist for the position of beginning librarian  p  the regression model developed by getz to measure the union nonunion wage differential also found that the variables of cost of living and the strength of the public sector union movement were significant predictors of salary levels the variable of public sector union strength
 the library quarterly measured by the percentage of government employees covered by collective bargaining contracts was found to raise the fringe benefits of public library employees significantly getz felt that this might be due to either pattern setting or increased political effectiveness of the union at the state level an examination of the literature in the field of economics reveals a number of studies on the unionnonunion wage differential lewis landmark study in the early s showed the unionnonunion wage differential in the private sector to fall between  percent and  percent this figure is often used as the base to which other findings are compared  a summary of the literature by parsley which concerned itself primarily with the private sector indicated that while studies show a differential does exist there is debate as to its size and the reasons for it  part of the problem stems from the different variables used in the various studies another problem in many of the studies is that spillover effect the effect that unions can have on wages in nonunion shops is not accounted for in determining wage differentials wage differentials were also found to vary over time due to changes in the economy differences between union and nonunion wages also varied according to industry occupation sex race and region of the country studied mitchell review of the literature determined that not only do unions significantly raise wages above nonunion levels for comparable workers but also the earnings in the heavily unionized sector grow at a faster rate  p  findings also showed that the heavily unionized sector was characterized by higher expenditures on fringe benefits in relation to total compensation larger establishments a lower proportion of women in the work force and a lower rate of turnover there have also been a number of studies investigating the impact of unions on wages in the public sector three reviews of the literature concluded that for the most part unions have had some positive impact on relative wages   the extent of this impact has been found to vary widely from   percent to   percent depending on the group surveyed and the method used perry concludes that while collective bargaining has raised relative wages by a small amount the labor market and the economic conditions in the area play a more significant role than does unionization  p  such widely fluctuating results are problematical but as mitchell put it they are not very different from the general conclusions of comparable literature on private sector unionization  p  one of the problems with many of the public sector studies is that while fringe benefits are an important part of the public employees pay package they are often not considered in wage studies union impact is thus somewhat distorted
impact of unions on salaries  another problem that is encountered in public sector wage studies has to do with using an ability to pay variable in the analysis per capita receipts or the tax mill rate is often used as an ability to pay variable this variable may influence the wages of public employees but the direction of the relationship is not clear as mitchell points out while high taxes may lead to high wages in the public sector the reverse may also be true  p  balkin study found a  percent wage differential over time for four clerical positions in the public sector due to unionization  ability to pay wages property tax rate and the form of government of the municipality were not found to be significant in the variation of wages because this study surveyed only those governments in the metropolitan area of the twin cities minnesota they were all exposed to the same potential spillover effects of unionization from this review of the literature it can be seen that there is an interest in unions and collective bargaining on the part of librarians while few of the studies had sample sizes that were large enough to support reliable conclusions findings suggest that many librarians do want some sort of organization to look out for their economic and professional interests age and education appear to be factors in determining librarians acceptance of using collective bargaining to gain these ends and slightly more than one third of the librarians surveyed favored joining unions one study has supported the premise that librarians feel their personal goals vis avis salaries and fringes have benefited from collective bargaining  studies of wage differentials in both the public and private sectors do show differences between union and nonunion wages although the magnitude of the difference that can be attributed to the union has not been completely determined preliminary studies in the field of librarianship also indicate that a difference exists although again the amount of difference that can be attributed to union presence has yet to be determined this study will attempt to measure the amount of variation in librarians wages that can be explained by union presence a number of factors emerge from these studies as affecting salary size in some way these variables should be accounted for in any model that is developed to measure union impact on salaries the first factor that appears to influence salary size is union presence because union presence was found by guyton to be associated with large libraries  size of the institution should be measured to determine whether it has a separate impact on salaries the cost of living and the strength of collective bargaining in the public sector were found to be important predictors of wage variation by getz  they should also be included in any predictive model that is developed the measure of the strength of collective bargaining in the
 the library quarterly state will also help to account for any spillover effects from the union to the nonunion institutions there has been evidence from both sides that the ability to pay variable is important in determining wages in the public sector  p   because it may explain some of the variation in salaries it also should be included in the model objectives the objective of this study is to determine whether library unionization influences the wages of library employees in order to determine the extent of this influence on relative wages the influence of the cost of living in the area the library budget the size of the institution and the strength of the union movement in the area will also be measured hypothesis it is hypothesized that the variation in salaries of library employees can be explained in part by whether a union that represents librarians is present in the library to determine the extent to which the librarians union affects salaries the following model was developed to test the hypothesis y  bo  bifte  bwfo  btotpc  bcol  bu  blu  e where y  the annual salary for a position in a given library bo  a constant fte  the number of full time equivalents employed by the library wfo  the percentage of local government employees organized in the state totpc  the total per capita receipts of the library col  the cost of living in the area u  the presence of a union in the library lu  the presence of a union in the library that represents librarians and e  error all the variables except union presence and librarian union presence will first be analyzed for their impact on salaries then union presence will be added to the equation to determine if its presence explains any additional variation in salaries over and above that which is explained by the first four variables finally the presence or absence of a union that
impact of unions on salaries  represents librarians will be added to the equation this last step will show whether any additional variation in salaries is explained by librarian union presence above that amount of variation explained by the first four variables and simple union presence this model concerns only union impact on salaries while the model does identify other potential predictors of salaries there is no attempt to rank them in order of their importance in explaining salary variation because of this the order in which the first four variables are fed into the equation is not important what is important is that union presence and librarian union presence are fed into the equation last in this way it can be determined whether library union presence explains any more of the variation in salaries than was previously explained by the other variables this model will be used to analyze librarian union impact on the salaries of three positions those of the clerk the beginning librarian and the department head procedure population and sample in  carl sandstedt director of the st charles city county library in missouri sent approximately  questionnaires to public libraries and library systems in minnesota iowa missouri kansas nebraska and north and south dakota the questionnaires were sent to all public libraries in those states with budgets of over  per year the same questionnaire was sent to all library systems and state library agencies regardless of the size of their budgets the survey was primarily concerned with the salaries paid to employees occupying seven positions in the library the shelver clerk paraprofessional librarian department head assistant director and director data were also collected on the size of the library its budget how the budget was spent and whether a union was present in the library of the  questionnaires sent out  were returned from public libraries and eighteen responses were received from library systems and state agencies the results of sandstedt survey were published in his  salavy schedule of west north central states  in the present study the data collected by sandstedt were submitted to a secondary analysis to determine the impact of unions on salaries instrumentation and data collection to determine the impact of the librarians union on wages other relevant variables were also measured it is assumed that the cost of living will be reflected directly in the
 the library quarterly wages in an area where the cost of living is high wages are expected to be high data on the cost of living were taken from the american chamber of commerce researchers association cost of living index for the third quarter of   only those libraries which fell into the smsas listed in the index were assigned a statistic as coverage of the united states is not complete only forty six libraries had a cost of living variable this led to problems with sample size which will be discussed in the section on data analysis the size of the institution is another factor that can influence the setting of wages this is partly because unions tend to form where there are large concentrations of workers in an attempt to forestall this employers will sometimes offer higher wages than they normally would the number of full time employees is used to determine size spillover effect is linked with another factor that can influence the setting of wages and that is the extent to which the work force as a whole is unionized the spillover effect from unionized workers can act to drive up the wages of nonunion workers the percentage of public sector employees unionized in the state was used to measure this variable while this figure is not as specific to each library as would be desirable it does give some indication of the strength of the public sector union movement on the state level given that bargaining rights for public employees are legislated at the state level it is not an inappropriate measure to use data were taken from the bureau of national affair government employee relations report  pp   the amount of money the library has in relation to the size of the library and its staff tends to be a critical factor in determining the level of wages paid to its employees libraries get varying amounts of support from their communities and the government this support may go into higher salaries for employees or may be channeled into other parts of the library budget the per capita receipts of the library were used as an indication of its ability to pay mitchell caveat mentioned before should be reiterated the nature of the relationship between high revenues and high wages is still open to question wages were measured at three different levels  clerical the lowest annual salary paid to a starting clerical employee  librarian the lowest annual salary paid to new library school graduates with the mls degree and  department head the top rate paid to an employee who is not the director or assistant director of the library two union variables were measured the first union variable consisted of a zero one dummy variable where one equaled the presence of a union in the library excluding a union that represented only custodians and zero equaled the absence of a union the second union variable consisted of another zero one dummy variable where one
impact of unions on salaries  equaled the presence of a collective bargaining unit that represented librarians and zero equaled the absence of such representation for librarians this distinction was made to determine the actual impact resulting from the unionization of librarians rather than any spillover effects on librarians from the presence of other unions in the library method of analysis a hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the model developed for this study in the first step salary was regressed onto the following variables number of full time equivalents percentage of the work force organized per capita receipts and the cost of living which were entered in stepwise fashion on the second step the residual variation of the salary scale was regressed onto the residual variation of the first union variable any union presence and then onto the residual variation of the second union variable librarian union presence findings of the  libraries that responded to the questionnaire twenty one reported that a union operated in them eleven of these libraries had unions that represented librarians in two of the eleven cases the librarians union was an autonomous unit representing librarians solely in the remaining nine cases the librarians had elected to be represented by the same bargaining unit as the other library employees clerical or technical workers for example this is probably best explained by the size of the library and the number of librarians employed the two libraries that have independent librarian unions are large libraries one with  fulltime equivalent employees sixty seven of whom are librarians and the other with  full time equivalent employees twenty six of whom are librarians the nine libraries in which the librarians have chosen to be represented by the same unit as the other library employ between seven and seventy one full time equivalent employees and a proportionately lower number of librarians kleingartner discusses the appropriateness of mixed bargaining units for librarians  p  he points out that small groups simply do not have the necessary clout to bargain effectively in smaller libraries librarians may feel they have a better chance of making gains by affiliating with the unit composed of clerical and technical workers six of these mixed units that also represent librarians are affiliated with afscme while three of them are affiliated with the communication workers of america cwa of the twenty one unions found in the libraries surveyed the majority
 the library quarterly of them twelve are in minnesota this fact should not be surprising given that  percent of its local full time government work force is organized statewide this compares with an organized local government work force of  percent in iowa  percent in nebraska  percent in south dakota  percent in north dakota  percent in missouri and  percent in kansas no library unions were reported in north dakota kansas or missouri an examination of the annual salaries for each of the three job positions shows that clerical salaries ranged from  to  per year with a median annual salary of  beginning librarians salaries ranged from  to  per year with a median annual salary of  department heads salaries ranged from  to  per year with a median annual salary of  table  compares the median annual salaries of the three job classifications on the basis of union and librarian union presence or absence as can be seen from the table union presence appears to be related to higher annual salaries in all three job categories presence of a librarians union appears to be related to even higher salaries for the categories of librarian and clerk it is just this variation that this study will examine how much of this variation can be explained by such factors as the cost of living in the area or the per capita receipts the library receives how much of the variation can be explained by general work force conditions such as how strong the union movement in the area is or how many employees work at the particular institution finally how much of the variation can be explained by the presence of a collective bargaining unit and the benefits it can win for its members to answer these questions and test the hypothesis posed earlier the model developed in the hypothesis section was applied to the salary data in each job category however because over half of the libraries did not have cost of living data available for them it was decided to drop the cost of living variable from the model in order to increase the sample size the hierarchical regression model used to test whether librarians unions have an impact on the salaries of library employees thus became y  bo  bifte  bwfo  btotpc  bu  blu  e or that a salary is the function of the number of full time equivalents in a library the percentage of local government employees organized into unions the per capita receipts of the library the presence of a union and the presence of a librarians union in the library

 the library quarterly unions representing librarians do add a slight amount of explanation of the variation using this model on the subset of larger libraries the amount explained is not great however it is simple union presence that plays a very significant role in explaining wage variation using both models conclusions because this study was a secondary analysis of data sample groups were not as large as they should have been so that reliable conclusions could be drawn application of the models developed indicate that unions representing librarians do explain a small but significant portion of the variation in the salaries of mls librarians given the presence of the other variables no significant amount of variation was explained by librarians unions for either the clerical or the department heads salaries the amount of variation in salaries explained by librarians unions almost tripled when the model included the cost of living variable this finding may be attributed not so much to the cost of living as to the fact that a subsample consisting of the larger libraries was used with the model the presence of a collective bargaining unit representing any library employees does explain a significant amount of variation in the salaries of the beginning clerical worker union presence that is any union presence does not explain a significant amount of variation in the salaries of beginning librarians or department heads given the model developed in this study unions appear to have a positive impact on the salaries of those job positions they represent discussion this study was an attempt more scientifically to explore the impact that unions have on the salaries of library employees while union impact is indicated there is still quite a bit of variation in salaries that has not been explained by this investigation it would be worthwhile to explore the other variables that have an impact on salaries and thus clarify even more the role that librarians unions play it would also be interesting to determine whether the results of this study hold true for other parts of the country if such a study were conducted an analysis of fringe benefits should be included as they are
