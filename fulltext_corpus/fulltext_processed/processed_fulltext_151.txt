environmental factors affecting the permanence of library materials carl j wessel i introduction and objectives protecting library materials against the dangers of environment is a critical problem inadvertent misguidance on the subject could hasten damage to valuable library materials most librarians realize this and agree on the need for deep study of the protection of library collections against deteriorative environments one of the more encouraging signs in the recent past is the library of congress brittle book project  the recognition of the importance of the library materials deterioration problem at the level of the library of congress the association of research libraries and the council on library resources places the matter at the echelon where adequate attention may be brought to it and the required national effort made to provide the restoration conservation and preventive measures required if we are to leave behind us library collections usable in the distant future this discussion will attempt to investigate environmental factors affecting the permanence of library materials and will try to draw some concepts from the information developed that will lengthen the life and usefulness of library collections it is the objective of this paper to emphasize that deterioration of library materials can arise from inferior operating and storage conditions over both short term and prolonged periods it will review some pertinent evidence relating to deterioration originating with air pollution heat and humidity light and biological agents focusing for the most part on the environments encountered in american urban research libraries it will emphasize the effects of temperature humidity and such air pollutants as ozone sulfur dioxide and the nitrogen oxides since biological attack is not usually a widespread danger in these libraries it will be discussed briefly these points will lead to suggestions regarding how librarians may lengthen the useful life of library materials through environmental controls including some of the details of modern airconditioning practices criteria and specifications ii environmental factors important in the library a brief insight into the underlying causes of materials deterioration should prepare us to understand what happens to library materials when they are kept in hostile environments the term environment is used these days in so many connotations that i shall define it as the physical chemical and biological  i acknowledge with thanks the kind cooperation and assistance of the following people in the preparation of this paper frazer g poole library of congress verner w clapp and melville j ruggles council on library resources charles olin william b walker and aleita hogenson national portrait gallery curtis l brown institute of paper chemistry a j haagen smit california institute of technology arthur j broering national library of medicine blanche l oliveri national agricultural library james gear national archives william k wilson and c s mccamy national bureau of standards robert m organ national museum of history and technology herbert c s thom us weather bureau morton a bell american air filter company inc george pettengill american institute of architects and richard d smith and howard w winger graduate library school university of chicago 
 the library quarterly elements which make up the space we live and work in and in which we carry out life and civilization as we know them usually these physical chemical and biological environmental factors bring their degrading effects to bear at a fairly slow rate some factors now included in our broadened concepts of environment damage our library heritage much more rapidly such as riots fire and deliberate destruction table  environmental factors important to museums a the atmosphere pollution b light actinic effects c temperature variations d humidity variations e vibration f parasites and saprophytes insects molds g people accidents vandalism h acts of god flood fire i mechanical failure of control systems soutcecameron  p  the factors we are dealing with are energy forms some of very high power others of fairly low level all are capable of bringing about physical or chemical reactions in materials usually the reactions are undesirable and decrease the stability of library materials obviously the reason we have libraries is to preserve man historical records and his thoughts and intellectual creations some recorded material has little importance and it does not matter a great deal whether it lasts any longer than the people or events about which it is written on the other hand some recorded material has very great importance and should be preserved indefinitely but often we cannot predict the importance of recorded material in advance thus in the past and even now we have usually attempted to preserve all records for at least a moderate length of time or as long as we practically are able by utilizing the most stable materials known to the art and science of the times then we gamble that what is important will be recognized in time to take extra precautions to extend the useful life of the material on which it is recorded or of which it is made the materials on which we record events or print all manner of things vary greatly in properties and form some are rather fugitive in nature and even under good environmental conditions are soon unusable examples include some of the cheap papers other materials are extremely stable and even under rather undesirable environmental conditions will persist for long periods of time as for example certain types of rock but even the most stable materials are susceptible to some forms of environmental degradation in the long run it becomes a matter of compromises choices of materials of practical stability available in amounts and at costs that can be afforded and with properties that can be tolerated and environments for use and storage which tend to reduce physical chemical and biological changes to a minimum the subject of this discussion is the factors of environment their composition the energy properties of environmental components and the ability of these components to react advantageously or disadvantageously with the materials of our library collections included will be some examples of the effects of poor combinations of materials and environments on the valuable records of our civilization and history duncan cameron in   listed the environments he considers important to museums these are shown in table  table  shows cameron concepts of the ideal environment for the museum his sanguine humor is undoubtedly shared from time to time by many librarians the ideal environmen

environmental factors affecting permanence  are the number of days in these cities when the concentrations of total oxidants reach the values shown a seemingly anomalous phenomenon in the air pollution field should be noted it is especially interesting to the librarian because of the importance of the acidic sulfur dioxide to the degradation of paper sulfur dioxide is a reducing substance while the photochemical air pollutants we have been discussing are oxidizing substances ordinarily one might expect that such oxidants as ozone and sulfur dioxide would react with each other until there is an excess of one or the other the extreme dilution of these pollutants in the atmosphere however permits them to coexist and one may note oxidizing and reducing degradation phenomena simultaneously the situation is rather easily understood when one considers reaction rates in relation to the small concentrations of reactants whereas in fairly high concentrations a reaction would proceed in perhaps a few thousandths of a second in the extremely low concentrations of air pollutants a similar reaction might require an hour   atmospheric factors humidity water occurs in all the normal states of matter solid liquid and gas it also takes many forms ice snow glaze sleet or hail ice fog liquid water rain water in the aerosol form of fog or mist and finally water vapor water vapor is water in the gaseous phase and is usually referred to in terms of humidity for the consideration of the librarian water vapor is the most important form of water the materials of the librarianhis buildings his collections and practically all that he works with are protected for the most part against all forms of water except water vapor the following discussion considers water only in the vapor form and will omit the less usual albeit devastating damage which may come about from such phenomena as floods or water damage caused by sprinkler systems and the like humidity measurements include absolute and relative humidity absolute humidity is measured in terms of the mass of water vapor per unit volume of natural air relative humidity expresses the ratio of the actual water vapor content of the air to its total capacity at a given temperature the warmer the air the greater amount of water vapor it is table  absolute humidity gkg  c f rh  rh rh                      sourczplenderleitb and philippot  pp   capable of holding when air holds as much water vapor as it is capable of holding at that temperature it is said to be saturated and is at its dew point an enlightening way of showing the relations between temperature relative humidity and absolute humidity is that of table  taken from plenderleith and philippot  this shows how the actual amount of water in the atmosphere increases for a given relative humidity as the temperature rises the effect of humidity on library materials is more important than on library workers or patrons nonetheless because temperature and humidity conditions in libraries are usually chosen with both materials and people in mind a few remarks should be made about factors of human comfort cold air with high humidity feels colder than dry air
 the library quarterly of the same temperature on the other hand hot air with high relative humidity feels warmer than it actually is these effects are due to a combination of heat conduction from the body at the temperatures and humidities involved as well as the cooling effect on the body brought about by evaporation of water from body surfaces the feeling of comfort or discomfort experienced by man is then a result of both temperature and humidity the us weather bureau has developed a temperature humidity or comfort index which gives values in the   range reflecting outdoor atmospheric conditions of temperature and humidity as a measure of comfort or discomfort in warm weather this index ith is measured as follows ith   dry bulb temp f  wet bulb temp f   when this index value is  most people feel comfortable at  about half the population is satisfied at  most people are uncomfortable without unnecessarily oversimplifying a subject which is complex at best man is an aqueous creature in order to exist in his most healthy state he must maintain a proper water balance with his surroundings this may sometimes require humidity conditions which would be considered a bit on the uncomfortable side he cannot suffer dehydration of any magnitude for more than short time periods without serious physiological effects the various materials the librarian is dealing with daily also must remain in equilibrium with the proper humidity in order to retain their most desirable properties and endure for long periods of time these conditions are not necessarily the same for all library materials it stands to reason that conditions must be chosen so that most materials involved are in or near some reasonably favorable range of humidity when considering the matter of humidity and temperature with reference to the possible damaging effects of the heat and water on objects books manuscripts museum items etc it is very important to remember that it is the temperature and humidity conditions of the object which control deterioration reactions these conditions are not always the same as the measured ambient or atmospheric conditions except when they are under constant control for example in a library if an object such as a book is at a temperature higher or lower than that of the air in the library the relative humidity of the layer of air close to the book will differ considerably from that of the ambient room air this has given rise to the term object humidity  which of course refers to the relative humidity of the thin film of air in closest contact with the surface of the book if the temperature conditions in a library vary greatly over the period of a day relative humidities thought to be in the safe range of perhaps   percent can rise to much higher humidities conducive to mildew or other damage to books paper leather and other objects the nature of water makes it important both as a chemical agent and as a physical agent often it acts in both roles simultaneously for example when water dissolves carbon dioxide a small amount of the water actually reacts chemically to form the compound hc most of the water however plays the physical role of acting as a solvent medium for ionization and the production of hydrogen ions responsible for the acidic properties of the solution water may be regarded as extremely active in promoting reactions between other substances entering into

environmental factors affecting permanence  content of materials and of the atmosphere is important in the problem of permanence with a given water content of the atmosphere a sudden drop in temperature will bring about a rise in relative humidity if the rise of humidity is sufficient condensation of the water in the air can occur covering surfaces with liquid water if this occurs often enough or for a sufficient time water damage to susceptible materials can result condensation due to temperature changes in air cooled buildings is discussed in considerable detail by verrall  this article is recommended especially for study by those responsible for libraries in older buildings or in small wooden buildings and buildings with crawl spaces specific recommendations are made for the storage of photographic film finally the influence of heat in combination with biological agents cannot be overlooked although humidity is a much more important environmental factor in occurrence of and damage by microbiological agents heat does play a part even with these organisms heat plays an even more important part with the macrobiological agents insects and rodents biological agentsbiological agents do not cause great damage in the majority of urban libraries in the united states however this should not be misunderstood to mean that the biological deterioration problem no longer exists in any urban libraries or is not a serious source of trouble in some libraries throughout the world the problem of deterioration of books and archival materials caused by biological agents often becomes of great importance in some countries certainly if one includes museums along with libraries biological agents assume tremendous importance in damaging historic and artistic cultural works museums of course commonly include in their collections many materials rarely if ever found in libraries many of these are particularly susceptible to damage by biological agents it is of the greatest importance to be aware of infestations of certain microbiological and biological agents when newly discovered materials are brought into museums andor libraries it is essential that such materials be treated to destroy the organisms before they enter the collections although many of our modern urban libraries do not have large rare book collections it is nonetheless essential that newly introduced materials of often uncertain history and composition be examined and treated adequately before acceptance the subject of biological agents with reference to libraries and museums has been reviewed many times with considerable authority      fungi bacteria and actinomycetes are the organisms referred to as microbiological agents in libraries and museums in small numbers they are usually too small to be studied by the naked eye in sufficiently large numbers their colonies are of course visible theoretically the bacteria could be of importance to libraries however few if any cases of bacteria damage have been recorded although there are bacteria which can attack cellulosic materials such as in paper and do considerable damage library environmental conditions are not conducive to such attack there are a few cases of actinomycetes being found in libraries     the fungi constitute the most important of the microbiological agents to the librarian for the most part because compared with bacteria they thrive best in relatively dry conditions that is to say although fungi require high
 the library quarterly relative humidities they do not thrive well in the presence of liquid water bacteria on the other hand require comparatively aqueous conditions for growth and multiplication the fungi are extremely numerous in genera and species and are ubiquitous spores of fungi are to be found just about anywhere under on and above the earth and await only the proper conditions of moisture temperature and sometimes light to vegetate grow and reproduce it is perfectly safe to state that every library in the world is liberally seeded with perhaps hundreds of genera and species of fungi thus the important idea in control of fungi is to maintain temperature and humidity conditions at levels not conducive to growth of the microorganisms this does not mean that cleanliness and removal of dust and dirt do not assist in reduction of the fungal problem but it does mean that cleanliness is only part of the story there are numerous genera and species of fungi table  presents only a very approximate idea of the various genera which have been identified on materials in libraries chiefly on paper these data have been gathered together from a few of the very large number of references on the subject    but probably the most important genera of fungi which endanger libraries are represented the growth and reproduction of fungi are influenced by a number of environmental factors temperature relative humidity light oxygen and nutrients fungi are more tolerant of relatively wide temperature ranges than they are of wide ranges in other environmental factors that is they may be expected to be viable at unexpectedly low and unexpectedly high temperatures three temperatures are important to growth and reproduction the temperature below which growth and reproduction do not occurthe temperature range at which most rapid growth takes place and the temperature above which no growth occurs fungi have been found to grow at temperatures near freezing as well as those as high as   c low temperature growth of table  microbiological agents of deterioration genera of fungi materials attacked references alternaria dematium these organisms may     monilia cladosporium not necessarily attack aspergillus slysanus paper but may damage penicillium stephanoma it by staining or mucor botryotrichum foxing some can stemphylium haplographium destroy cellulose can hormodendrum trichoderma cause staining of bookfusarium trichothecium bindings and damage chaetomium sporotrichum to glue pastes and myxotrichum sporodesmium other adhesives and eidamella rhizopus to binding cords and acrostalagmus streptomyces leather parchment spicaria epicoccum artificial leather and cephalothecium scopulariopsis plastics torula monosporium stachybotrys acrothecium gymnoascus paecilomyces cephalosporium

environmental factors affecting permanence  environmental respiratory or nutritional requirements of these many insects since these factors vary widely suffice it to say that insects are found under numerous combinations of climatic conditions and occurrence of nutritional factors from extremely dry to hot and humid low temperatures however discourage most insects iii the effects of important environments atmospheric pollutantsatmospheric pollutants are important to the librarian not only because of their physiological effects on himself and his clients but because of their deteriorating effects on the materials in his collections and the great trouble and costs required to protect against them thomson  recently reviewed the subject of air pollution as it pertains to conservation chemists this article is recommended for review by all librarians and museum curators interested in protecting their collections the public as well as government officials in the united states have been awakened to the fact that the air pollution problem is of vast importance to all aspects of american life and far reaching programs have already begun to alleviate the problem however the problem is still with us and we must be aware of the damage which has already been done and continues to occur particulate matter in the air is one problem even though some programs successfully reduce or eliminate the emission of particulate matter by industrial emitters such as chimneys and stacks common dust dirt sand and other finely divided particulates are caught up from streets buildings fields and other sources and blown about by winds thus librarians must always be prepared either to clean up such materials from library collections by dusting or use of vacuum cleaners or they must prevent the particulates from entering buildings by using high efficiency filters a glance at table  reminds us of the types of particulate matter although much flying dust and dirt is quite drythat is why it is so easily picked up by the wind it can still soil surfaces such as book pages and bindings if conditions are moist such dirt can stain the materials and be difficult to remove if it comprises nutrients for fungi and if conditions are moist such dirt can result in the growth of mildew with consequent staining and discoloration of paper or other materials the abrasive action of dust and dirt on paper and other library materials such as leather is also a serious deterioration problem if dust or dirt carries acidic or alkaline substances and conditions are moist it can alter the ph of paper or other materials and cause deterioration one of the most important deterioration problems facing librarians today and well into the future is the deterioration of book paper as a consequence of improper acid content this is not solely an environmental problem since it has arisen primarily from methods of manufacture of the papers which have gone into books all over the world for a very considerable time yet part of the problem is environmental and thus a proper subject for inclusion in this discussion that is to say part of the library deterioration problem which occurs today and has for the past several hundred years is caused by the presence of acidic components in the atmosphere especially sulfur dioxide the contemporary nitrogen oxide problem in the polluted atmosphere of many of our cities gives rise to some nitric acid this too adds to the hydrolytic degra
 the library quarterly dation of paper this part of the discussion will pertain chiefly to the effects of sulfur dioxide and to the acid sulfuric acid which arises through oxidation and solvation from sulfur dioxide the subject of permanence of paper as well as of many other materials of interest to the librarian has a very large literature there are of course many reviews and texts on the subject which should be consulted                some of these works are on the general subject of aging and include much more than the effects of acid such as heat aging light effects biological damage the effect of paper composition and miscellaneous causes of deterioration of paper other library materials and even museum collections the subject of paper impermanence due to high acid content is treated authoritatively by smith in a recent review  there does not appear to be any question that high acidity causes paper impermanence there have been numerous investigations of the subject and the evidence is overwhelming the deterioration which occurs is characterized as hydrolytic and is chiefly an attack catalyzed by the hydronium ions produced from acid substances on the cellulose which comprises the chief fibrous ingredient of paper the rate of deterioration increases with hydronium ion concentration that is with a lowering of the ph values of the paper as measured on a water extract the deterioration is manifested by a decrease in the strength tear resistance of the paper and loss of flexibility folding endurance a very considerable portion of the acidity in papers can come from the materials used in manufacturing chiefly the alum rosin sizing this is discussed in some depth by smith  who cites the outstanding works on the subject among others the reader is referred to the extensive work of barrow         barrow was one of the first modern research workers to recognize in an effective way that the acidity which was really built into the paper as a consequence of the constituents used in the manufacturing process is more important than the acidity of polluted atmospheres some earlier workers had of course discussed the matter according to smith at the turn of the twentieth century experts thought that a minimum ph of  for a hot water extract from first class permanent book paper was acceptable we now know that this is much too acid and that paper with this acid content will embrittle quickly with time the opinions about the ph value required for stable permanent papers altered as time passed smith points out that by  workers claimed that the ph of hot water extracts should be at least  and preferably above  by  it was recognized that hot water extracts with a ph of less than  was a major cause of deterioration in even the best classes of paper according to smith in  grant claimed a minimum hot water ph of  to be necessary for permanent printing papers lewis  in  reported on a test commenced in  in which the hot water extract ph of the three good papers used were   and  smith further discusses the most desirable hydrogen ion conditions for permanent paper and leaves the impression that hot water ph extract values should approximate neutrality that is ph  or even be on the alkaline side of neutrality although acidic components of paper ther considerations in addition to permanence pertain to the ph problem and are discussed by other speakers of this conference
environmental factors affecting permanence  play a major role in paper hydrolysis and deterioration the acidic components of polluted atmospheres cannot be dismissed there is excellent evidence that atmospheres containing s can lower paper folding endurance as much as  percent in ten days when the s concentrations approximate what might be expected in badly polluted cities slow oxidation of the carbohydrates of paper with the production of carboxylic acids and an accompanying production of hydronium ions or decrease in ph occurs in accelerated aging of papers and presumably in natural aging acidity due to sulfur emissions is usually produced by sulfur dioxide this oxide forms sulfurous acid when in contact with water in order to form sulfuric acid a much stronger acid and oxidizing agent than sulfurous acid it is necessary for sulfur dioxide to be oxidized to sulfur trioxide when sulfur dioxide is emitted from stacks or chimneys for example it is almost immediately oxidized to sulfur trioxide probably catalyzed by ash constituents  the sulfuric acid formed from sulfur trioxide in the presence of water is largely responsible for the bluish smokes typical of what is called sulfur dioxide emissions  in areas where strongly oxidizing materials such as nitrogen dioxide ozone peroxides and the peroxy free radicals are present more rapid oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide may be expected automobile exhaust and also olefins in the presence of nitrogen oxides also appear to cause more rapid sulfur dioxide oxidation by the photochemically produced oxidants  the presence of iron and manganese salts also materially increases s oxidation to s  for some time there was some question whether sulfur dioxide pollution of the atmosphere could cause paper deterioration in books smith  quotes from jarrell hankins and veitch who demonstrated however that all kinds of paper in books will pick up enough acidity by s penetration throughout an exposed book to have devastating effects on permanence although the position of the page in the book and the distance from the edge of the page has an influence no parts of the paper appear to escape deteriorating effects hudson  using a flat glass electrode and a small amount of water for each sample was able to measure the ph of samples of twenty five books varying from  to  years of age his results confirmed that atmospheric pollution is one of the causes of low ph values particularly at the edges of pages his nondestructive method of ph measurement is easily applied and should be considered by anyone interested in the acidity of the book papers in his library collection hudson and his co workers   developed a method for measuring the affinity of sulfur dioxide for paper and for examining the effects of such variables as temperature and humidity on this affinity the method uses sulfur dioxide containing radioactive sulfur s so that its presence and migration may be detected and measured easily they found that even good quality papers easily pick up sulfur dioxide at concentrations which can be expected in the atmosphere of any normal city the moisture content of the paper is closely related to the rate of sulfur dioxide pickup and this rate is increased by storage under damp conditions high pickup is also favored by high ambient temperatures they point out that conditions in books would be different than their tests with single sheets since the paper in books is protected by the edges other studies have shown however that there is diffusion of acid into

environmental factors affecting permanence  permanence and durability of paper are often grouped under the term aging wilson and hebert  discussed this matter succinctly in a recent paper they stated that permanence is basically a function of the chemical stability of paper durability on the other hand they say is primarily a function of the physical properties of the fibers and the way they are compounded to form a sheet of paper a paper which is intended to receive rough treatment for a short lifetime must be durable but not necessarily permanent there is obviously a relationship between permanence and durability and the proper balance must be achieved the phenomena which occur in paper as time passes and which are somehow involved in demonstrating durability and permanence can be classed together as aging librarians are more interested in permanence than in durability many properties of paper seem to be involved during the aging process and the determination of these properties gives some idea of how papers measure up to expectations some of these measurements are reflectance color and brightness ph acidity folding endurance brittleness tear burst and tensile strength measurements the commonest measures of permanence are folding endurance and ph it is not my intention to explore property analysis methods but only to mention them briefly as terms which will be used from time to time in discussing deterioration it is appropriate to mention in passing that hebert tryon and wilson  have added a new methoddifferential thermal analysis to those available for investigators and find it appears to be promising as a technique for evaluating stability there appears to be high correlation with ph values in another study however wilson and hebert  did not find high correlation between ph and the rate of deterioration of physical properties of paper high temperature exposures of paper even for short periods cause yellowing and brittleness moderate heat over long periods has a slow aging effect on paper low temperatures are regarded as preservative to paper a combination of moderate to high temperature and low humidity will cause paper to dry out and become brittle the moisture content which is in equilibrium with  percent rh represents about as low as is safe for paper if humidity is held above  percent rh for long periods mildewing will occur generally it is recommended that temperature be about  f and relative humidity   percent for effective preservation of paper   james gear personal communication may  at the national archives states that they maintain temperature at    f and relative humidity at  percent   percent werner  recommends for archival materials chiefly paper and parchment that the atmospheric humidity should be controlled between   percent relative humidity at a temperature of  f as will be recalled from an earlier part of the discussion the new national agricultural library at beltsville maryland was built to specifications equivalent to   percent rh in the temperature range of   f at the same time werner gives  percent rh as the critical value above which mildew and mold growth will occur plenderleith  also states that  percent rh is the absolute danger limit in the temperature range of  f in actual practice he states that  percent rh is preferable as the
 the library quarterly permissible upper limit of relative humidity to guard against mildew in view of the importance of object humidity as discussed elsewhere in this paper a permissible value of  percent appears to be a bit high further the recommendation of permitting ambient humidities as high as  percent rh seems to be skirting the danger zone somewhat lower relative humidity values perhaps   percent appear to be safer for library materials launer and wilson  found that a temperature of  c for three days will cause extensive damage to paper mild heating will cause yellowing of paper made from new rag refined sulfite old rag soda sulfite and newsprint pulps especially those bleached by light they found that the yellow color caused by heating could be bleached out by light and the bleaching caused by light could be nullified by heating depending upon which process predominated the effects of heat on paper vary greatly depending upon the quality of the paper and the nature of the various constituents used as fillers shaw and oeary  found that rag papers characterized as good book paper were not appreciably affected in heat tests purified wood pulp also produced a fairly stable paper paper made from a mixture of sulfite and soda pulp was less stable than those made from the purer fibers there was a close relationship between the purity of the cellulosic fibers used and the stability of unsized papers made from them but only a small amount of alum and no rosin size was used in other tests the acidity of the paper has had a great bearing on ability to withstand heat in his review on paper permanence associated with acidity and storage conditions smith  makes several good points with respect to the effects of heat he points out that a good deal of our past history shows deplorable lack of interest in the effects of high heat on books and paper several cases of extremely high storage temperatures are cited which must have resulted in greatly abbreviating the useful life of the books smith observed that we should not be surprised that many of our books are useless but rather that the majority of books in libraries can still be used and it is probably true that today many libraries and book storage areas still have excessively high temperature conditions especially in the summer temperatures of  f are normal in the summertime in warehouses and boxcars values taken from barrow  are of interest in that they show the effect of temperature on a paper rate of deterioration folding endurance was measured on new book paper after heataging at  c  c  c and  c and the data plotted as regression lines for each temperature the values obtained in the barrow study indicated that it takes  times longer to reduce this paper folding endurance to a given value for each drop of  c in temperature the times required to reduce the paper from  folds to sixtyfive folds by heating at temperatures from  c to  c and by extrapolation the times required to produce the same result at temperatures below  c are shown in table  smith  adapts the data of browning and wink  using calculations with the arrhenius equation to develop sthe logarithmic form of the arrhenius equation is as follows k ea t t logio   ki r t t where logio kkl is the ratio of the rates of reaction k at the higher temperature  c and

 the library quarterly microns with a strong band at  millimicrons in these tests they showed that discoloration of paper is a combined effect of light and heat the yellowing of delignified paper commonly ascribed to light is due to heat or age when heat effects were eliminated during irradiation by control of temperature of the experiment the papers actually bleached and even lignified paper bleached when irradiated in an oxygenfree nitrogen atmosphere the two apparently opposite effects bleaching table  probable relative damage wavelength probable relative mp damage             sourczadapted from judd  judd values x  and yellowing may occur simultaneously if a white paper turns yellow when irradiated reactions other than photochemical ones may be involved papers containing lignin will however yellow in air or oxygen even in the absence of heat effects paper scorched brown at high temperatures or yellowed at  c as well as a  year old yellowed paper all were bleached by light launer and wilson  also showed that water vapor accelerates the effect of light on paper made of cotton cellulose but has the reverse effect on paper made from wood pulp free rosin and sulfuric acid increase the effect of light on cotton rag and purified woodpulp papers much more than on inferior papers work done by the national bureau of standards in connection with the preservation of the declaration of independence and the us constitution shows the connection between the wavelengths of light and damage to paper and parchment exposed to this light reference is made to table  previously shown the national bureau of standards also did studies to extend the range shown in table  to  millimicrons some of these values are adapted from judd  and shown in table  here we can see how rapidly relative damage increases as we get deeper into the shorter wavelengths judd  p  makes the statement the probable rate of damage from radiation continues to rise with decreasing waveiengths below  millimicrons but this is of no interest in museum lighting because none of the light sources available emits appreciably at wavelengths below the band  to  millimicrons characterized by the value of probable rate of damage at  millimicrons sitnilarly the probable rate of damage from radiation continues to fall with increasing wavelength above  millimicrons and is known not to reach zero short of  millimicrons note that the infrared can be photographed to about this wavelength but these small probable rates of damage to the average museum object are negligible compared to those associated with the shorter wave energy emitted by all light sources suitable for museums what judd says about museum light sources and damage can generally be considered to hold true for libraries judd study  of the radiation hazard of museum light sources contains valuable information for librarians seeking advice on the protection of their collections from light harrison report on the deteriorating effects of modern light sources  should also be consulted for valuable information our review does not permit us to include many of the details in these two reports but some indicative material should be mentioned it should be recognized of course that the museum curator lighting problem is somewhat different from
environmental factors affecting permanence  that of the librarian museum objects of historical or artistic value vary greatly in their material nature also there is always a problem of exhibiting these objects to the best artistic advantage to permit the viewer to see them as the original artist intended many of these objects already have suffered considerable deterioration many more of the objects in museums and art galleries must be displayed to the best color advantages as for example paintings judd brings out clearly the dilemma of the museum curator  p  from the estimate of probable relative rate of damage of museum objects from radiation it may be seen that every light source giving good color rendition radiant emittance well distributed throughout the visible range  to  millimicrons is necessarily associated with appreciable radiation hazard   the directors of museums have therefore to make a difficult choice for each museum object either they can display the treasure by a light source yielding a good approximation to the color rendition of natural daylight thereby eventually destroying it by photochemical decomposition or they can seal the treasure in a vault screened from all radiation and filled with an inert gas thereby preserving it indefinitely but also preventing anybody from ever seeing it or they can adopt some compromise between these two by comparison the librarian problems of illumination are simpler he wishes chiefly to provide suitable light by which clients may read or study albeit often for extended time periods without doing damage either to his clients eyes or to the items in his collections studies of damage by radiation to museum collections are quite applicable to library problems for example white  in discussing library lighting standards brings out the fact that recommendations for illumination in libraries has increased considerably over the period of   table  shows the recommended values white also points out that some libraries kent state library and davenport public library have already gone to levels of   footcandles in reading rooms blackwell  reports on the lighting requirements for sample library tasks his data ranges from  footcandle required for very easily read print to  footcandles for reading difficult spirit duplicated samples some of his recommended lighting standards for libraries range considerably higher than those reported on by white judd report on museum lighting  provides interesting data both from the standpoint of relative damaging effects per footcandle for a large number of different light sources and for consideration against the increasing levels of illumination being recommendtable  recommended minimum illumination values in footcandles          reading rooms              workrooms           periodical room             card catalog           stacks                corridors               lavatories           sowtxwhite  p  original sources of values provided by white  radiation values provided in judd tables

environmental factors affecting permanence  mates are submitted as guides in the selection of light sources for museums i do not wish to draw any quantitative conclusions by combining white and judd reports rather i wish simply to draw attention to the manner in which increasing values of illumination bring with them increasing probabilities of deterioration iv environmental controls because we know the effects of improper environmental conditions on the materials in library collections we are in a position to reduce deterioration by adjusting conditions to desirable levels the adjustment of temperature and humidity the removal of particulate matter such as dust and dirt and the elimination of damaging air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and ozone are properly the responsibility of the air conditioning expert adjusting these factors to optimum levels for permanence of library materials helps to insure that the present library collections will remain useful into the far future although air conditioning will not repair the damage of past deterioration it will appreciably reduce any further damage restoration experts can apply their talents to returning the materials to a useful condition in many cases it is the responsibility not of the airconditioning expert but rather of library materials research people to inform the air conditioning engineers of the environmental conditions required to keep books in the physical chemical states most conducive to long life as will be evident from earlier discussions in this paper we have fairly good knowledge of temperature and humidity requirements we know that dust and dirt should be held to a minimum but we do not yet have definitive knowledge of criteria for gaseous air pollutants it is quite important that we develop such knowledge because the criteria that must be met determine the cost of providing the service with costs rising so rapidly today many library budgets cannot stand extravagant airconditioning costs and the end result could be a return to improper environmental conditions although this discussion pertains mostly to long life for books the airconditioning problem reaches into the human comfort area fortunately the most desirable ranges for both considerations coincide approximately if anything the most desirable temperature conditions for books are somewhat lower than for people it appears that americans make more of this problem than do europeans europeans appear more willing to dress warmer to be able to utilize libraries at lower temperatures than americans do the subject of heating ventilating and air conditioning libraries is discussed for the layman in metcalf book  on planning library buildings it provides a fine discourse on the general aspects of the subject chiefly from the standpoint of patron and staff comfort some hints on collection preservation are included however such as the importance of humidity regulation when moisture conditions are low for example in areas where outside temperatures may be very low perhaps  or  f heating of the same air indoors to  f will lower relative humidity to perhaps  percent while people may adjust to these undesirable conditions albeit with discomfort books papers and old leather bindings will deteriorate among numerous other aspects metcalf also discusses the problems associated with addition of moisture to library atmospheres and

 the library quarterly use of filters which remove practically all damaging wavelengths but permit adequate illumination for display purposes the subject of climatology and conservation is treated thoroughly by plenderleith and philippot  their discussions of hygrometry or the measurement of the amount of moisture in the air of the instruments for measuring atmospheric moisture and of the various equipments for humidifying and dehumidifying the atmosphere are especially recommended for any librarian wishing to become more knowledgeable in control of his collection environment modern air conditioning equipment that is for controlling temperature and humidity are discussed the matter of cost of environmental control is discussed in terms of its importance in the overall budget of a museum and the comparative costs of different approaches helpful suggestions are made for consideration of numerous aspects of the environmental problem some can eliminate need for extensive environmental control and some give very practical common sense solutions to problems pollak   discusses the several methods in common use for reducing humidity as a method of preventing document deterioration these vary from the simple method of reducing relative humidity by heating to the absorption of water vapor out of the air by using substances such as silica gel to the use of the heat pump type of equipment a common example of the heat pump is the refrigerator this type of equipment operates by removal of water through condensation brought about by lowering the temperature of the air the temperature of the newly dried air is then restored to the desired level in some cases utilizing heat generated in the process and returned to the areas controlled although pollak does not provide any specific costs in terms of dollars he discusses the economics of the various dehumidification methods amdur  introduces a novel idea for humidity control in museums in his isolated area plan this plan appears to be most applicable to buildings in climates with very cold winters here one meets the problem of condensation and frosting on windows when an effort is made to keep relative humidity at a safe level for museum objects the same observation would hold true for libraries since the relative humidity requirements are similar amdur idea is to prepare a building within a building and to utilize the intermediate air insulation layer to buffer the temperature differences between the outside and inside the subject of equipment and costs for removal of the gaseous air pollutants is not well documented as mentioned earlier ashrae does recommend an alkaline wash of the air at ph   but this recommendation is not always followed thomson  discusses removal of sulfur dioxide and oxidants briefly he mentions that water washes alone can sometimes remove as much as   percent of the sulfur dioxide but cautions against depending upon this efficiency he quotes studies in which all sulfur dioxide is removed as ph values of  or better but states that ph values of more than  could cause damage to metals some efforts to control sulfur dioxide by absorbents are mentioned but not prominently the removal of oxidant gases such as ozone nitrogen dioxide hydrogen peroxide and a variety of organic ozonides is also discussed briefly by thomson  recommendations in this area are

 the library quarterly ance of deleterious conditions finally some of the criteria and specifications for environmental control available to librarians have been examined attention has been focused mainly on the more common materials in libraries chiefly paper and leather with brief mention of a few other materials this was necessitated more by the time limits of the article rather than by the lack of problems and information of necessity then discussion was avoided of some of the more recently recognized environments such as forms of radiation which affect the storage of magnetic tapes certainly a form of storage becoming quite common and very important furthermore it was necessary to omit discussion of the effects of the common environments on the many types of new materials such as photographic and microfilms magnetic tapes in general plastics rubbers and adhesives in conclusion it is recommended that more attention be paid to library deterioration problems the criteria for safe usage and shortand long term storage of library materials could be investigated in much greater depth and clarified considerably the preparation of more acceptable specifications for library environments safe for library materials is sorely needed these specifications should cover not only temperature and humidity but all forms of pollutants particulate matter of all kinds and the gaseous acidic and oxidizing pollutants as well finally the specifications should provide practical guidance for the librarian in choosing the proper illumination so that both his clients and his collection will be adequately protected references  schaffer norman j library of congress pilot preservation project college and research libraries  january     cameron duncan environmental control a theoretical solution museum news  may     weaver elbert c air in the encyclopedia of chemistry edited by george l clark and gessner g hawley new york reinhold publishing corp   pollution causes costs controls chemical and engineering news  june     s stem arthur c air pollution  vols new york academic press   searle victor c technical information resources in the air pollution field journal of the air pollution control association  march     hanks james j and kube harold d industry action to combat pollution harvard business review  september october     committee on pollution waste management and control washington dc national academy of sciences publication    haagen smit a j air conservation scientia  may june     haagen smith a j the chemistry of atmospberic pollution in museum climatology edited by g thomson london international institute of conservation   american society of heating refrigerating and air conditioning engineers ashrae guide and data book fundamentals and equipment new york ashrae   american society of heating refnrgerating and air conditioning engineers ashrae guide and data book applications new york ashrae   jaffe louis s photochemical air pollutants and their effects on men and animals i general characteristics and community concentrations archive of environmental health  december     waller r e studies on the nature of urban air pollution in museum climatology edited by g thomson
