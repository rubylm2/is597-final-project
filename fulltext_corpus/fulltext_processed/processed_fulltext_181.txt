alphabet and bibliological terms in some early judeo christian literature francis j witty abstract texts presented from the gospel of pseudo thomas and the contra haereses of irenaeus both written before ad  employ the word alphabet and are earlier than d diringer citation for its first appearance in literature bibliological terms found in the apocrypha and pseudepigrapha of the bible and some early christian literature are translated and presented in their context and discussed it is concluded that some terms are not adequately treated in the standard lexica thus thorough examinations of such terms in individual christian writers of this early period are still needed systematic studies of bibliological terms in the works of individual greek and latin writers have yet to be made particularly of those writers of the early centuries of this era when the form and material of the book were changing from a roll of papyrus to a codex of parchment birt  and wattenbach  remain the classics for the general treatment of ancient book terminology but i know of no other works of this nature which deal with such terms in individual authors except that of arns on jerome  and my own study on cassiodorus  recently i had the occasion to reread the so called apocrypha and pseudepigrapha of the old and new testaments that is the extant greek and latin texts and some christian literature of the first few centuries of our era particularly the works included among the apostolic fathers the purpose of this reading originally was a theological inquiry but some terms were noted that would be of interest in the history of writing and bibliology in general the various terms are presented in this paper under the headings alphabet writing instruments and materials and bibliological terms greek words have been romanized alphabet diringer in the latest edition of his history of scripts  makes the following statement about the word alphabet the pseudo tertullian work katdlogos haireseon chapter  mentions ex graecorum alphabeto but when was ths work written altaner patrologie freiberg  seems to attribute it to hippolytus of rome flourished from ca ad  died ad  if this attribution is accepted we have here the first mention of the word alphabet   two features of this statement appeared somewhat anomalous first the latin quotation cited under a greek title in greek script second that a latin work would be attributed by altaner a respected patrologist to hippolytus who wrote in greek now i am aware that the works of some early christian greek writers are known only or partly in latin translations but such a situation is ordinarily clarified before a citation is presented the cited edition of altaner  was   this statement would seem to be a slight improvement over that of the second edition london  p  it alphabetum was first mentioned by tertullian ca ad   and by st jerome ca   
bibliological terms in early literature  searched and what appears to be the text that lead diringer to his above conclusions is on page  where a lost work of hippolytus syntagma or hapdsas tas haireseis is mentioned but all that altaner says here is that the lost work can be reconstructed from other works and mentions the pseudotertullian de praescriptione has reticorum   epiphanius and philastrius the clearest statement on the authorship of this work appears in the latest seventh edition of altaner patrologie  p  and this is substantiated in e dekkers clavis patrum latinorum  p  the work is entitled adversus omnes haereses and is believed by e schwartz  pp   to have been originally a greek work by pope zephyrinus ad   or a contemporary of the same name and to have been translated into latin by victorinus of pettau died ca  this attribution by schwartz has not been disputed either by altaner dekkers or refoule  p  n  the title cited by diringer in the quotation above is not used in any of the patrologies i examined but the thesaurus liinguae latinae sv alphabetum  vol  col  cites ps tert catal haer but in its index volume published four years later which lists editions cited the work appears as adversus omnes haereses  index p  thus according to the most accepted patristic authorities this work would not have appeared until the first part of the third century and its latin version cited by diringer would not have been completed before the latter part of the fourth century however two other works apparently unknown to diringer from the latter part of the second century mention the word and so provide us with even earlier testimony the first work the gospel of pseudo thomas  pp  is extant in two greek versions called a and b by tischendorf and the word alphabetos appears in both the pertinent incident is the attempt on the part of a teacher zacchaeus to teach the child jesus the alphabet text a states the case briefly for the teacher recognized the talent of the child and feared him nevertheless after he zacchaeus had written the alphabet grapsas ton alphabeton the child studied it for some time but did not answer him  pp   text b goes into more detail about the incident and uses alphabetos as a feminine noun when zacchaeus had written the alphabet grapsas    ten alphabeton in hebrew characters he said to him lpha and the child said lpha and again the teacher said lpha and the child likewise then again for the third time the teacher pronounced the alpha then jesus looked at the teacher and said ou who do not know the alpha how can you teach the beta and beginning with alpha the child recited the twenty two letters on his own  pp   of course the reference is to the twenty two letters of the hebrew alphabet in addition to these texts from the apocrypha we can add two passages from the contra haereses of saint irenaeus died ca    a work written before  and reconstructed through quotations from other authors and a latin translation the first passage    describes the greek alphabet as a vehicle for expressing numerals that is certain letters were used for units tens and hundreds then too the alphabet of the greeks ton alphabeton ton hellenon contains eight ones eight all translations used in this paper were made by me the pertinent terms in the citations are italicized
 the library quarterly tens and eight hundreds making up the sum of eight hundred eighty eight   col  the reason for only eight of each and not nine no zero among greek numerals is that the character antisigma was used for six but was not a regular letter of the classical greek alphabet the other passage  praef  appears in the latin translation of book two the original greek of which is lost and since i narrated in detail how through numerals and the twentyfour letters of the alphabet viginti quatuor elementa alphabeti they heretical teachers make bold to attempt an establishment of truth   col  the twenty four letters are those of the greek alphabet for at this time the roman alphabet had only twenty three letters i and w were yet to come and no distinction was made between u and v two further passages are mentioned in the liddell scott lexicon under alphdbetos  and can be found in the anecdota graeca of bekker  but they are merely titles of lexicographical works lists of words katd alphabeton in alphabetical order these titles appear in the lexica segueriana    and among the additional notes to the scholiasts on dionysius thrax  the latter being a title mentioned in cod vat  fol  according to krummbacher   paragraph  such lists date from the beginning of grammatical studies in byzantium constantinople in the tenth and eleventh centuries of this era and it can be taken for granted ordinarily that alphabetical lists in strict order beyond the first letter or two are of late date   it should be noted finally that the other instances of the latin term alphabetum which are cited in the thesaurus linguae latinae  vol  col  date from the fourth century or later now we proceed to terms relating to writing writing materials and instruments and to the book in general some notes on sources the works surveyed for bibliological terms were the greek and latin texts of the apocrypha and pseudepigrapha of the old and new testaments and the collection of early christian works known as the apostolic fathers although all the works of these collections were thoroughly examined the particular works in which pertinent material was found were the epistle of ignatius to the ephesians greek written possibly in the first decade of the second century the shepherd of hermas and the martyrdom of polycarp both greek works of the middle second century texts for all three works are in lake   and lightfoot   the former of the loeb classical library contains english translations on facing pages however the most recent text of the martyrdom is that of bihlmeyer  the acts of peter with simon is a third century latin version of a greek work written around ad  text in lipsius et bonnet  the acts of pilate or the gospel of nicodemus possibly dates only from the early part of the fourth century in its present form but a work known as the acts of pilate was mentioned by both justin apol   and tertullian apol  in the latter part of the second century it has come down in several greek and  augmented throughout by henry stuart jones the supplement to this work  was consulted but proved to be not pertinent to the subject of this paper  cols   see also the latest work on this subject j w daly contributions to a history of alphabetization in antiquity and the middle ages collection latomus vol  brussels revue dtudes latines

 the library quarterly shouted from their individual cells as if with one voiceamen now they got up and karinus gave his roll charta sua to annas and leucius gave his to caiphas and bidding farewell to one another they went forth and returned to their tombs then annas and caiphas opened up the roll of paper tomum ckartae and began each to read to himself thereupon annas and caiphas were struck with fear and handed the roll of papyrus tomum chartae to rabbi addas rabbi finees and rabbi egias who had come from galilee and proclaimed jesus ascension into heaven and all the crowd of jews trusted them to read this writing and they read the roll chartum which went as follows  pp   the long apocalyptic passage which follows and purports to represent the writing of karinus and leucius would be much too long for a single sheet of papyrus thus charta tomus and tomus chartae here must mean roll of papyrus the use of these terms in a fourthor fifth century work attests to the persistent employment of papyrus for epistolary writing well after its place had been taken in book production by the parchment codex just as the variae of cassiodorus     shows its continued use in the files of the imperial civil service in the midsixth century now let us examine some terms referring to the book and its use bibliological terms for a comprehensive account of ancient greek book terms the work of haeberlin  although now somewhat old is still standard bulos biblos was the primary name for papyrus as well as for its chief export city gebal this term and the diminutive form biblion bublion are by far the most commonly used terms for book in greek literature and the latter occurs frequently enough in early christian literature as can be readily seen in the article on this term in lampe  p  biblion also carried the meaning of letter that is epistle  pp   p  and interestingly enough it appears in the acts of pilate greek xv with this meaning but the modifying term tes epistoles is added now they handed over to him the roll containing the letter td biblion tes epistoles and joseph took it read it and rolled the letter up   p  it should be noted however that although biblion is diminutive in form it ordinarily has the same meaning as biblos that is to say book in general or book as a part of a larger work as attested in the lexica  pp   two other diminutives of biblos but of less frequent appearance than biblion were also encountered biblidion and biblaridion  pp   both are given adequate coverage in lampe  p  although birt treats only biblidion and what looks to be a metathesized form of the latter bibliddrion  pp   however this last diminutive gets equal treatment on the same page in lampe its meaning is the same as that of the other two but with an occasional connotation of self depreciation by an author the writer has noted this usage of the diminutive libellus by cassiodorus in a reference to his variae  p  biblaridion is the book in the angel hand in revelation apocalypse   where it is used interchangeably with biblion biblidion appears in the epistle of ignatius to the ephesians  and seems to mean letter just as biblion  pp  although it is translated by lake as book    if jesus christ allows me through your prayers and it be his will i will show you in the second letter biblidfoi which i intend to write you  p  in the shepherd of hermas the passages presented below employ biblaridion and biblidion inter
bibliological terms in early literature  changeably with the simple meaning of book and probably with no diminutive significance at all this seems to be corroborated by the latin version which employs the simple liber throughout it should be noted that latin after the classical period tended to proliferate diminutives without any diminutive significance as is shown in this particular subject by jerome use of libellus  p  and by many standard words in the romance languages for example oiseau from aucellus a popular form of avicellus a diminutive of the regular word avis bird which obviously are derived from these late diminutives the passages from the shepherd appear in the second vision vision  after rising from prayer i saw before me the elderly woman whom i had seen the previous year walking about and reading a book biblaridion   i said to her now give me the book biblidion so that i can copy it  p  vision  i took it and after going to a certain place in the country i copied the whole document letter for letter because i could not make out the syllables and then when i had finished the letters of the book biblidion the book biblidion was suddenly snatched from my hand but by whom i did not know  p  as noted by lake    n the inability to recognize syllables could stem from the custom in ancient times of writing in a continuous script without divisions between words especially in private copies in the same work a little later on biblaridion again appears vision  and so you shall write two books biblaridia probably better rendered as letters and you shall send one to clement and one to grapte  p  in the latin west by the late fourth century volumen properly roll from volvere to roll was fast losing its etymological significance and was coming to be used like liber to mean work whether in roll form or codex  pp    pp   thus when the term appears in the so called correspondence of paul and seneca which is dated between  and   pp  it could merely mean a work certainly the translation of james in a volume  p  does not make much sense the passage occurs in letter iii from seneca to paul i have organized some of my books volumina and dressed them up with their own proper divisions i am determined also to read them to caesar  pp     the latin of this passage reads as follows quaedam volumina ordinavi et divisionibus suis statum eis dedi ea quoque caesari legere sum destinatus what exactly is meant by ordinavi and divisionibus suis statum dedi is anyone guess it could mean arranging into chapters with chapter headings capitula    perhaps the fourth century author of this fictitious work thought of his placing a list of capitula or tituli at the beginning of the work as one finds in some biblical manuscripts and in other works like the latin manuscripts of josephus antiquities  p  during the early period when the papyrus roll was the standard form of the book the latin loanword tomus   pp   was used in the same sense as that of the original greek namely roll of papyrus and this seems to be the sense of the term in the following excerpt from manuscript c of the latin acts of pilate now before they had begun to write both raised their right hands and made the sign of the cross and then began to write in their individual rolls in singulis tomis and when their writing was ended they shouted
 the library quarterly from their individual cells men  p  n  bibliotheca meaning bible is not uncommon in early christian literature  pp    pp    pp   n  for the bible would have required a number of rolls and would have constituted a small library in itself this term continued to mean bible even after the universal adoption of the codex and there is some controversy about whether saint benedict was referring to the monastery bible when he spoke of the bibliotheca in his rule  p  it appears in this meaning several times in manuscript b of the latin acts of pilate afterwards pilate having entered the temple of the jews    said to them i have heard that you have a certain large bible magna bibliotheca in this temple of yours for this reason i ask that it be brought before me and when the very bible ipsa bibliotheca decorated with gold and precious stones was brought forth by four attendants pilate said to everyone i adjure you by the god of your fathers who ordered you to build this temple as a place for his sanctuary not to keep the truth from me you know everything that is written in this bible of yours bibliotheca ista but now say if you have found this jesus of yours in the scriptures the one whom you crucified that he is the son of god who is to come for the salvation of the human race and in how many years in chronological reckoning was he supposed to come   they annas and caiphas said to pilate  it is our custom every year to open this holy bible ista sancta bibliotheca before our assembly and seek the testimony of god and we have found in the first book of the septuagint genesis where michael the archangel spoke to the third son of adam the first man about  years in which there would come from heaven the most beloved son of god the anointed one christus  pp   this passage later mentions the bibliotheca esdrae again referring to the bible the term codex is always of interest to the historian of the book when it occurs in early literature however the term originally was applied to anything composed of several boards tabulae fastened together if we are to take seneca word for it the passage in seneca refers to a certain claudius who was the first to induce the romans to take to the sea that is to build ships it was claudius and he was given the name caudex because of it for any item composed of a number of joined boards was called a caudex from this public records publicae tabulae are called codices and even now ships which carry supplies on the tiber are called from ancient custom codicariae  it is codex meaning public record and modified by the adjective publicus for clarity that occurs in the same latin acts of pilate in the chapter following the temple incident cited above when pilate heard these words of annas and caiphas he recorded everything on the activities of the lord savior in the public records in codicibus publicis of his hall of justice and wrote a letter to claudius king of the city of rome  pp   although the literature here surveyed did not reveal any interesting or unusual writing terms graphou scribo and their compounds only the epilogues perhaps better rendered colophonsto the martyrdom of polycarp tell of the copying and recopying of the work and show how precarious was the life of an ancient work in manuscript there are two versions of the epilogue cited here as a and b in which however the terms for write and copy are merely grdpho and its compounds and derivatives a now gaius copied metegrdpsato this from the copy of irenaeus a disciple of polycarp who also lived in the same city as irenaeus then i socrates in corinth wrote jgrapsa
