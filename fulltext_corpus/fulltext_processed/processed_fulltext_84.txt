the library quarterly volume xii april  number  a note on the theory of book selection herbert goldhor i a n increasing amount of attention reflected in the growth of the literature is being devoted to the theory of book selection in libraries many of the pertinent investigations were not undertaken with the sole or principal aim of contributing to the formulation of such a theory but they have so served the librarian who has kept abreast of professional studies and has pondered on their implications in this connection will be aware of the broad outlines of the theory that is being evolved this paper represents not an attempt at the presentation of the whole theory but only a tentative elaboration of certain important points in it which the author feels have not been clearly explained and of whose significance there has been too little appreciation hitherto if there is one idea more basic to the theory of book selection than any other it is this librarians have long selected books i those who are familiar with the work of dr douglas waples will recognize the great influence it has had on the preparation of this note the best sources that can be cited for background to the present paper are james h wellard book selection its principles andpractice london grafton  esp pp   and douglas waples bernard berelson and franklyn r bradshaw whaot reading does to people chicago university of chicago press i esp chap iii distribution of publications pp  i i
i the library quarterly according to literary criteria while the reading situations with which they are concerned are to be understood only in sociological and psychological terms the main question that the book selector must consider is what happens to people when they read from this question of the effects of reading the whole theory flows a good way to begin the consideration of what happens to people when they read is to look at the unit combination with which we are concerned the individual and the publication he is reading in every situation in which an individual reads print three factors are always present i the reader with certain personal characteristics  the publication with a certain content and style and  the goal or goals sought by the act of reading which reflects the reader personal wants as stimulated and modified by his present social environment these three more immediate factors occupy the foreground in the background more remote and indirect in their influence are two other factors that must be considered in explaining the communication of ideas by print these are i the author his purposes characteristics and the social forces at work upon him and  the previous social conditions and environmental influences that explain why the reader seeks the effects that he does seek broadly speaking the analysis of the author can be subsumed under the study of the publication and the analysis of the reader background under the study of the reader technically these second rank factors should be treated separately the extent to which the reader obtains the desired effect de for evidence on the association of readers traits with the quality and quantity of reading see robert a miller the relation of reading characteristics to social indexes american journal of sociology xli i      to be precise a reader goal is one of his personal characteristics but the individual purpose in reading is such an important factor and is so clearly dissimilar from the other persopal traits of the reader eg age sex education and occupation that clarity in analysis is facilitated by setting up a separate category for it  such influences can cover a wide range eg seeing a movie based on a book the closing of the plant in which the reader works the entry of the nation into war etc in selecting books for the library only those factors can be considered that affect groups of people the readers adviser however in selecting books for a particular reader will need to know about the relevant personal factors influencing that individual see below n so
a note on the theory of book selection i scribes the efficacy with which a given type of publication produces that effect on such an individual the reader purpose is often not the same as the effect produced upon him by his reading the more nearly identical are purpose and effect the more successfully was this publication selected for this reader assuming that purposive selection and not random choice was involved to borrow the figure of the economic man from classical economic theory each economic reader ideally is conscious of his own traits identifies his desires and proceeds to that print distributing agency which is best suited to his purpose wherefrom he selects or is helped to select the most appropriate publications actually of course the process is far less painfully conscious and less rational but this figure of the economic reader brings out the final factor needed to explain the individual reading situation the distributing mechanism whereby print and readers are brought together every time a publication is read some means of distribution is involved the distributing agency may be identical with the author as when a commercial firm writes prints and mails out a piece of advertising copy or with the reader as when he selects his reading from his personal library sometimes the distribution is entirely informal as when publications are borrowed from friends read in doctors offices or received unsolicited by mail or by hand but generally the distributing unit is a separate agency formally organized for the purpose for example bookstores rental libraries public libraries or newsstands it is this last broad group that is meant when any reference is made hereafter to print distributing agencies in considering the functions of the organized agency there are certain differences that can be distinguished between selec the most purposeful readers in this connection are scholars for a study of the extent to which they will go in the search for their material see douglas waples belgian scholars and their libraries library quarterly x     for a full development of this brief and highly simplified statement of the factors involved in the individual reading situation see waples berelson and bradshaw op cit and for a critique of the assumptions on which their analysis is based see hans muller two major approaches to the social psychology of reading library quarterly xii   
 the library quarterly tion to fit the individual reader needs and the chronologically earlier and necessarily previous process of institutional selection involving the policies and procedures by which agencies formally organized for the distribution of print decide on the types and kinds of publications they shall stock and make available to their patrons this institutional book selection as distinguished from the process whereby the individual reader chooses from a given collection is the general topic for consideration here the justification for the separation of institutional book selection from book selection for the individual reader and the necessity for analyzing the former apart from the latter spring from the fact that the two processes though related and similar in many respects turn on essentially different bases the process of institutional book selection operates with full attention to the individual reading situations which are expected to result from the functioning of the institution the agency seeks to avoid selecting publications that will not be used by the people it hopes to reach it either plans to sell the materials it stocks or hopes to rent them out or to circulate them gratis or to allow them to be used only on the premises whenever a distributing agency selects publications for its shelves it does so for a purpose and that purpose can be thought of in terms of the individual reading situations which the agency aims to encourage and help consummate agencies differ widely in the degree to which they recognize the factors involved in book selection for the individual yet the more clearly the agency understands the nature of the reading situations it aims to satisfy the more successful will it be in selecting books for its own purchase and in achieving its basic goal whether that goal is to make a profit as in the case of a bookstore or to build up the best possible collection in a subject field as in the case of a university departmental library  an even earlier stage of selection is found in the process by which publishers determine from among the manuscripts submitted to them those which they shall publish the present day attempts to rationalize that process indicate the need for the same kind of criteria that this paper undertakes to explore for the middle stage that of institutional selection
a note on the theory of book selection ig but in the process of institutional selection itself the three main factors found in the individual reading situation the reader the publication and the effect desired are not all duplicated it is chiefly with regard to the third factor the purposes of reading or the effects which it is desired to produce by reading that there spring the differences between the selection of print by institutions and the process of book selection for the individual one reader can express an infinite diversity of purposes in reading at different times and in different places subject only to the limits imposed first by his own background his education experience and maturity and second by the range of publications of which he is aware or to which he has access because of the wide diversity of purposes expressed by individual readers print distributing agencies have generally found it necessary to limit the area of readers wants to which they will address themselves this delimitation follows two lines first of all each agency will devote its efforts to meeting those requests of readers which are in closest harmony with its main objectives thus a rental library strives to make as large a profit as possible with this goal in mind the proprietor is able to decide whether to serve those individuals who seek the knowledge to be had from a study of higher mathematics in place of or in addition to those who seek relaxation in the reading of detective stories the concreteness of this agency goal offers a sharp criterion by which to identify the readers desires it shall attempt to meet a second basis for exclusion is found in the desire to avoid competition with other agencies in the same geographical area j the best evidence that different kinds of people secure different kinds of publications from different sources is to be found in ralph e ellsworth the distribution of books and magazines in selected communities unpublished phd dissertation graduate library school university of chicago  and in douglas waples people and print social aspects of reading in the depression chicago university of chicago press   similarly the reading wants to which school and college libraries will attend are likely to be clearly defined because of the dominance of the institution teaching objectives see edward a wight and leon carnovsky the library reading in general education an exploratory study ed william s gray washington dc american council on education  pp  
i the library quarterly once an agency has decided what type of readers wants are most directly associated with its own goals it soon finds that an important factor affecting the efficiency of its operation in terms of those goals is the presence of other agencies in the same area and with substantially the same objectiveso in the case of profit making agencies this means that there is economic competition between bookstores for instance whereby each strives to build up its own body of steady patrons either by doing a better job of fitting print to readers or by narrowing the field of readers needs with which it deals and thus specializing itself out of competition eg the rare book store in the case of print distributing agencies that are noncommercial this delimitation of the field of readers needs recognizes the wastefulness of duplication thus the main research libraries in a city may agree on a program of co operative buying and the assignment of special fields of subject knowledge for emphasis by each cf the agreement of this kind in the city of chicago between the john crerar chicago public and newberry libraries such agreements represent a tendency toward specialization in defining the particular purposes of readers on which each agency will concentrate it should be noted that sometimes the two bases of delimitation may take effect in the reverse order this occurs for instance when there is a bookstore in a town but no public library the bookstore can be expected to assume broad objectives in terms of readers requests even though it may mean that some of the services offered produce no direct profit with the establishment of a public library in the community the bookstore will abandon those services that the library can perform more efficiently and will reformulate its criteria for stocking publications on the narrower base of readers needs that it now strives to meet under its reduced program tc from the point of view of the inidividual agency an important characteristic of this second basis is that for the most part it lies outside its control as compared with the first basis the determination of its own objectives see below p i  x carleton b joeckel and leon carnovsky a metropolitan library in action a survey of the chicago public library chicago university of chicago press  pp  
a note on the theory of book selection  in short the objectives of a print distributing agency serve to indicate a the wants of readers it wishes to serve and b those wants which it has no interest in meeting the institution which will now be considered in this regard is the public library though there is no reason why analyses similar to that which follows cannot be made for any agency formally organized for the distribution of print ii what we are now concerned with then is a statement of the factors that should be considered in the selection of print for public libraries an example of the general area of institutional book selection if one looks at contemporary practice in this matter of public library book selection he cannot but be impressed by the number of assumptions on which current procedure rests and the extent to which they are unrecognized by the practitioners one of the major evils which flows from this situation because of the failure to recognize the relationship of the bookselection process to the individual reading situations that the library wants to encourage is the concept that the library collection should be well rounded the term is vague and open to numerous interpretations but presumably what most librarians mean when they seek to make their collections wellrounded is that first of all there be some material on every branch of knowledge and creative composition and that second purchases be apportioned among all the possible fields according to a rough subjectively estimated composite of the  every library collection should be built up  so that certain classes will not be overemphasized and others neglected the needs of the library exist and should be met as well as the needs of its readers helen e haines living with books the art of book selection new york columbia university press  p i  lionel r mccolvin states that the public library is a universal provider that it must embrace as far as possible all knowledge and activity the theory of book selection for public libraries london grafton  p x it is normally desirable to provide an initial stock of wide general appeal and to expand it as future demand indicates w a munford three thousand booksfor a public library some significant and representative worksfor a basic stock london grafton i p 
i the library quarterly amount of literature published in each field the distribution of previous circulation between the various classes of the dewey system and what the librarian experience indicates to him in a general way the registered reading public is likely to request not only is the goal of a well rounded collection of questionable practicability if indeed it is desirable at all but an entirely different approach to the whole problem of book selection for the library is called for when the implicit assumptions underlying the practice of book selection are made explicit and when the essential factors basic to book selection policy are pointed out and recognized the approach so suggested will start with the library patrons actual and potential whereas the older concept starts with the book collection it will limit itself to those wants of readers which the library wishes deliberately to develop and encourage and of this group to those which it is best able to meet whereas the older concept strives to take account of as many interests as possible it will emphasize the individual reading situation striving to bring the right book into contact with the right person at the right time whereas the older concept emphasizes the building of the book collection as such in which all and sundry may stumble or pick their way through the great and not so great books of the world to summarize what has been said so far it was pointed out that the three most important elements in the individual reading situation are the predispositions of readers the characteristics of publications and the effects sought in reading the process of institutional book selection must of necessity be fashioned to accord with these ultimate factors and the greater the degree  haines offers as a principle of book selection the injunction keep abreast of the changing currents of thought and opinion and give adequate representation to the scientific social and intellectual forces that are shaping the modern world op cit p  is see francis k w drury book selection chicago american library association  pp  i mccolvin op cit p  for evidence of the unreliability of this last factor see douglas waples and ralph w tyler what people want to read about chicago american library association and university of chicago press i esp pp  
a note on the theory of book selection isx to which this fact is recognized the greater the extent to which institutional book selection is a rationalized conscious and effective process in the light of this the three main elements for consideration by a public library in determining its bookselection policies are i the predispositions of its public  the characteristics of available publications and  the objectives of the institution of these the third will be discussed first it would be difficult to overemphasize the importance of the institution objectives in this connection to put the matter in the context supplied above it should be remembered that though the reading wants of even one individual are theoretically infinite in scope and diversity each print distributing agency must delimit the sphere of readers requests to which it will address itself the necessity for this delimitation arises from the demand for increased efficiency in administration and service which can best be achieved by specialization of function the delimitation itself is set by the terms of the institution objectives and occurs along two lines first those desires of readers will be served which most closely conform to the main objectives of the institution in question and second attention will be focused on those wants in this group which can be better served by the institution than by similar agencies holding more or less the same general objectives the inability of librarians to state the wants of readers for which they purchase books strongly underlines the weaknesses that result from the lack of clearly defined institutional objectives compare the definiteness with which a special library can state the factors which decide its purchases an appreciation of the bases on which institutional book selection proceeds will throw light on the appropriateness of the various objectives that a public library can consider for itself thus the flow of influence is not all onre way  in connection with this point see on the one hand the proposal for regional cooperation between libraries in the delimitation of objectives in wellard op cit pp  s and on the other hand the recommendation that the public library no longer buy fiction of the type duplicated by the typical radio serial drama in frances henne library radio relationships library quarterly xi   
xo the library quarterly the sources of contemporary public library objectives can be found in such factors as the social origins of the institution the convictions of the chief librarian and the trustees the general social milieu etc the currently accepted objectives can be summed up with a fair degree of adequacy for our purposes as information recreation and gducation information and recreation themselves warrant critical investigation but they have certain standard denotations while education is such a diffuse term and in view of the current emphasis on adult education is of such importance that our attention here can best be concentrated on it the cardinal weakness with education as an objective so far as guidance in book selection is concerned is that it offers little help to the library book selectors in pointing to the specific wants of individual readers which the library can attempt to meet this objective may serve satisfactorily if one accepts the concept of the well rounded book collection it is decidedly deficient when the library strives to fit specific books to individual readers with particular needs an objective of course can be arbitrarily sharpened theoretically the librarian and the trustees are at liberty to set up any objective they see fit they could also define it so rigidly as to make it a technically efficient guide to book selection as opposed to such arbitrary action however it is suggested that a body of factual information useful for indicating possible and practicable objectives should be secured by a study of the actual use which patrons make of the library book collection on the basis of existing evidence admittedly incomplete is wellard op cit pp   carleton b joeckel the government of the american public library chicago university of chicago press  pp i i arnold k borden the sociological beginnings of the library movement library quarterly i x  i   lowell martin the american public library as a social institution library quarterly vii    and clarence e sherman the definition of library objectives in current issues in library administration ed carleton b joeckel chicago university of chicago press  pp   g the province and purpose of the public library is to provide for every person the education obtainable through reading haines op cit p i  william c haygood who uses the public library chicago university of chicago press  pp   and helen l butler an inquiry into the statements of motives by readers library quarterly x  i 
a note on the theory of book selection ii one might hypothesize that three major uses which people make of the public library account for the overwhelming bulk of satisfactions so derived these three uses are for instrumental purposes for respite and for reinforcement the instrumental use of the library corresponds in large part to the current objective of providing an information service but has a broader scope whenever an individual reads print in order to secure fuller knowledge of a practical problem and greater competence to deal with it his reading serves him directly as a means of accomplishing a certain result examples of instrumental use would include the determination of the market price of a particular stock the use of a cake recipe the checking of a chemical formula against laws and principles laid down in a textbook the study of the career opportunities in nursing etc similarly the use of public library books for respite roughly approximates the objective recreation though again it is something more than that reading for respite would cover such uses of print as reading for vicarious adventure or for stimulus to the imagination or for relief from tension examples of reading for respite are provided by the scholars who pursue highly intellectual hobbies as a change from their usual work the vast bulk of detective and western story fans and the convalescents who read voraciously for no other reason than to fill up their time reading for reinforcement is not easily explained without a  it is easy to appear precise in dealing with this question and the reader should not be deceived all that one can say with surety is that certain broad effects can be isolated in waples berelson and bradshaw op cit chap vi the effects of reading pp   five major effects are distinguished instrumental increased self esteem reinforcement and its opposite conversion aesthetic enjoyment and respite the present writer construes the effect of reinforcement in a sqmewhat different light so as to include the second effect above increased self esteem and aesthetic enjoyment is discounted as quantitatively unimportant in the use of public library materials  ibid p  i from one point of view all reading whatsoever can be thought of as providing respite in the sense that the activity required in reading constitutes a relief from boredom or a variation from previous activity and will not be continued beyond the point at which such return fails to overbalance the deterrents involved in the expenditure of energy in the physiological process of reading in this paper however respite is being used in a narrower sense as explained in the text
i the library quarterly consideration of the place of reading as a medium of communication according to one theory of psychology at least humans have various basic drives eg sex hunger and the avoidance of pain and corresponding basic needs which they attempt to satisfy as well as they can in a complex society like our own such satisfactions cannot be secured without help from others a situation that demands an organized system of communications between individuals in the course of time various mediums of communication have been developed conversation print the radio and the motion picture of these conversation is the most used since reading is only an alternative method of securing satisfactions it is obvious that it will not be used except when it is found to be superior for this purpose to other mediums of communication from this point of view to urge reading for its own sake is no different than to recommend conversation as such but reading does possess in addition certain unique values because of the peculiar characteristics of print eg it can be more accurately aimed at the predispositions of minority groups than are the movies it can be more selective in its appeal than is the radio and it can disseminate widely the work of the most effective writers while conversation at best is limited to a relatively small group it is superior to variant forms of communication in offering people the opportunity to be told for instance that they represent values or possess traits more desirable than those attaching to other groups in the population or in offering people the opportunity to identify themselves in their imagination with individuals having such superior standing  see william albig public opinion new york mcgraw hill  esp chap iii communication pp    for an analytical comparison of reading with other mediums of communication with regard to its usefulness in the learning process see edgar dale relation of reading to other forms of learning in reading in general education ed gray pp    like other forms of experience however reading may produce undesirable as well as desirable reactions and negative as well as positive personalities william s gray reading and factors influencing reading efficiency in reading in general education ed gray p i  waples berelson and bradshaw op cit pp i 
a note on the theory of book selection i a stenographer may thus turn to stories of romance to find vicariously the emotional satisfactions she craves and is unable to secure in the real world about her for this purpose in some respects books are superior to conversation for few of her acquaintances are likely to be able or willing to build a word picture suited to her needs to the radio for she need observe no set schedule and to the motion picture for she can re read any passage at will it is possible that this same generalization holds true in an entirely different area for political radicals and conservatives though pubjic libraries supply the literature of both sides few individuals take advantage of the availability of the opposing literature to read it and be converted in other words the radicals read the radical literature and the conservatives the conservative literature because each group thus secures the soothing experience of finding that the authqr attitudes agree with their own predispositions when print is so used the effect is a reinforcement of the reader self esteem a strengthening of his self confidence and a lulling of incipient doubts as to the correctness of his position such a use of print is directly antithetical to that which education demands a comprehensive statement of the nature of education is quite beyond this author purpose and would lead far from the subject of this paper but there is one important characteristic of education that is relevant successful education may be said to involve a relationship between the teacher and the student of such a kind that the mind of the latter is led in a certain direction in this sense education can be thought of as a series of planned experiences such that the reaction patterns of the student are altered in a way that the instructor wishes by his ex the reasonableness of this hypothesis is supported in part by the existing evidence that people like to read about subjects that concern themselves and such interests vary directly with certain objective social characteristics of the readers see waples and tyler op cit esp pp xxiii xxiv and i   furthermore waples and berelson found that the most important influence that determined agreement or disagreement with political campaign arguments encountered in print vas the predispositions of the individual voters see douglas waples and bernard berelson public communications and public opinion in their public communications and public opinions chicago graduate library school university of chicago  pp i  mimeographed
i the library quarterly posure to certain experiences and not to others it is this characteristic of education that requires of every curriculum a clear statement of the goals to be sought it may be objected that to require this element in every educational situation makes for too narrow a definition if the term is to mean anything however it must be defined rigorously to distinguish it from such allied terms as learning and knowledge and trainingo and to differentiate it from the concept of education that would identify it with all of life this factor of change on the part of the pupil directed and purposive change and other than that due solely to growth is possibly the sine qua non of true education this makes education a painful process for it involves the acquisition of strange new patterns of thought if not also the destruction of existing and therefore pleasantly familiar patterns education as thus defined is not a common occurrence it is found most often in the family relations of a child to his parents where the well nigh perfect combination of circumstances occurs the parents know clearly the goal they wish to achieve eg the inculcation of proper eating habits they have control over the child behavior and they have numerous occasions to instil the lesson and equally numerous occasions to test the pupil mastery of it outside the family education occurs most often in the school though not all that takes place in the school is education in this sense it rarely occurs elsewhere in any systematic fashion thus it is that the teacher and the school have always been of  a classical statement of the concept of education from this point of view is to be found in john adams the evolution of educational theory london macmillan ii  esp chap i the nature and scope of educational theory pp i   see abrahm flexner he gates of excellence a plea for distinction between education and training ournal of adult education iv     i see ruth kotinsky adult education and the social scene new york appletoncentury  especially the foreword by william h kilpatrick pp v vi and chap ii schooling as life and life as education pp    for a statement on the use in the school of specific titles to produce changes in students thinking see leroy h buckingham the development of social attitudes through literature school and society lii  i  
a note on the theory of book selection i great social importance the story of socrates illustrates the influence that can be wielded by an effective teacher and the dictators of our day have learned the lesson well in a democratic society the teachers have a certain amount of freedom to decide the direction in which they will lead their students the public library however is in a poor position to accomplish any great amount of education in this sense it has no power to compel people to read it cannot force the patrons it does secure to read the materials that it feels are best for them it has no staff of pedagogues and no opportunity to supervise the reading of its patrons since the use of library books is typically a solitary voluntary process that takes place outside the library and it can administer no testing program to determine how well it has succeeded in educating a reader to a certain point of view not only does the library lack the powers and facilities to conduct education but librarians strenuously disavow the possession of any fixed goals toward which they would lead their patrons they maintain that whatever changes occur in readers are for the readers themselves to decide it is as though they posted a sign this library assumes no responsibility for what happens to you as a result of reading these books librarians seek thus to delegate to readers the responsibility that teachers assume in relation to students and yet as a matter of fact the library is not completely neutral because it too exposes people to selected experiences by making available on its shelves the works of certain authors and not of others but the difference is that the library materials are not purposely selected with an eye to the individual reading situations that will result or in line with clearly defined and practicable goals  it is possible that what librarians mean when they speak of education as an objective of the library is really covered for the most part by the purely instrumental use of books see wellard op cit pp    conspicuous for their deviation from this accepted pattern are the suggestions found in leon carnovsky community analysis and the practice of book selection in the practice of book selection ed louis r wilson chicago university of chicago press  pp o  and bernard berelson the myth of library impartiality wilson bulletin xiii   
i the library quarterly on the contrary as under the concept of the well rounded collection the library in effect educates in all directions there has been a great deal said about adult education and readers advisory work but it must be admitted that the number of people so reached constitutes but a fraction of those who come to the library for other purposes and of those who do use the adult education facilities of our libraries few indeed seek education that involves directed change materials on welding the history of greek architecture how to write business letters these are worthy interests beyond question but they are not education in the sense of purposively guided change the probability is that the bulk of our public library patrons seek clarification and reinforcement in their thinking rather than the unsettling experience of education while the school has an obligation laid on it by society to direct the education of youth so as to mold their thinking in line with the mores of the race and to develop in them the mental equipment they will need to carry on civilization the library is under no such obligation analysis of the conditions under which it operates shows that the public library is unsuited to accomplish any great amount of real education analysis of the actual functioning of the public library reveals that an important use to which people are putting its resources is that of reading for reinforcement where education results in breaking down existing patterns of thought and to that extent unsettling the individual reading for reinforcement involves a cementing of those patterns and the reassurance to the individual of the worth whileness of his place in society consider what would happen if all that we read did violence to our established attitudes or if every conversation we had involved the presentation of a point of view sharply challenging our own children live in a world of immediate gratifications with maturity and education the length of time during  cf grace kelley the democratic function of public libraries library quarterly iv  i is joeckel and carnovsky op cit pp  so  national education association the unique function of education in american democracy washington dc educational policies commission

a note on the theory of book selection i the library collection should be built to meet and answer present interests of readers this latter policy is faulty in that it limits itself for the most part only to those readers registered with the library and ignores the readers in the community who are not so registered not to speak of those who are nonreaders at present but more important it is faulty in assuming that what people read is determined by what they are interested in it seems clear that in reality the determining factors are accessibility and readability with subject interest a poor third the identification of the subjects on which most reading is being done or on which most people say they would like to read should be a minor aspect of a library study of its community and of the reading done therein more important are data on the other print distributing agencies in the area and on the predispositions and socioeconomic status eg sex age education occupation of the popvlation such data will indicate of themselves the subjects to which the threshhold of receptivity  in the graduate library school institute of i carnovsky objected to this same aspect of present book selection practice and suggested that it be replaced by selection that would bring to library shelves only publications that supplied the truth to put this in the terms used here he was in effect setting up an objective for the library such an objective could be served by the process of book selection described above thoughlike the objective of educationit might be implemented less easily than other possible objectives carnovsky op cit pp   see also his the evaluation of public library facilities in library trends ed louis r wilson chicago university of chicago press i pp    ridgway op cit  leon carnovsky measurements in library service in current issues in library administration ed joeckel p  leon carnovsky a study of the relationship between reading interest and actual reading library quarterly iv i  i io harold a anderson reading interests and tastes in reading in general education ed gray esp pp   douglas waples communitystudies in reading i reading in the lower east side library quartrly iii i i i and the relation of subject interests to actual reading ibid     and ethel l cornell the voluntary reading of high school pupils lf bulletin xxv     that the social characteristics of population groups are closely associated with and probably the determinants of social behavior is becoming increasingly clear for evidence on the association of these characteristics with reading behavior see miller op cit he suggests indeed that reading itself may serve as a reliable social characteristic the i study of sandusky ohio conducted by the office of radio research of columbia university has produced evidence on the association of such traits as economic status age religion and rural urban residence with voting behavior in that community see paul f lazarsfeld ed how the voter makes up his mind to be published by the university of chicago press
 the library quarterly is low but more to the point they will indicate what types and kinds of print are needed within any one subject field to produce certain specified effects on these readers and that after all is the heart of the problem as for the factor of the publications that are available there is need for a continuing process of analysis of the content of new books this content analysis need not be so refined and complete as would be necessary in the case of a research study that used this technique but neither should it be as haphazard unformed and unconscious a process as present book selection practice involves it is possible given the stated objectives of the library and knowing the important facts about the patrons to set up a number of categories by which to analyze the content style authorship etc of a piece of prints these categories must be worked over until meaningful relations are found between them and the traits of the library patrons they will then serve to guide the librarian in purchasing those items which in view of the characteristics of his patrons will best help him satisfy those needs and secure those effects which conform to the library objectives all three bases of institutional book selection are in need of serious investigation by students of librarianship but the one that needs most attention first is this matter of content analysis  by i columbia university readability laboratory had laid plans for and started work on a basic analytical bibliography to be supplemented by a current service for new books in an attempt to describe specific titles in terms that relate to various closely defined groups of readers the major emphasis in the analysis is apparently to be on readability ie stylistic analysis this is the first large scale project to consider the evaluation of specific books by nonliterary standards see the memorandum on estimating readability prepared by the readability laboratory of teachers college columbia university for examination by members of the ala subcommittee on readable books unpublished exhibit from the minutes of the november  i meeting of the subcommittee there are three major classes of references here characterized by decreasing directness of application i for an explanation of the theory of content analysis see waples berelson and bradshaw op cit chap iv the content of publications pp  i and appen b notes on content analysis pp i waples people and print pp o  and waples and berelson what the voters were told in their public communications and public opinions pp i   most attention so far has been given to content analysis in relation to the level of reading difficulty represented by the publication see william s gray and bernice e
a note on the theory of book selection  the development of each of the three basic factors library objectives community analyses and reading studies and content analysis is to be made in terms that are significant for the others the content analysis should be based on the known characteristics of the readers and nonreaders the community survey should seek data relevant to the institution objectives and those objectives should have their basis in existing relationships between readers and public library materials once the development of these three factors has been well started by the institution it will mean that the analysis of new publications goes on currently regular studies are made on the reading and readers and nonreaders in the community and the library objectives are being constantly refined clarified and retranslated into operational terms when these things are being done as a matter of current practice and are properly integrated eg by a formal statement of the library book selection policy and procedure the institutional process of book selection so carried on should better serve to carry out the library objectives in the community than would any other policy of book selection if one looks at this institutional process of book selection from the functional point of view it might be described in some such leary what maker a book readable chicago university of chicago press i a corrective to the point of view there expressed is to be found in mabel e jackman the relation between maturity of content and simplicity of style in selected books of fiction library quarterly xi ii   iii students who investigate the problem of content analysis from the point of view of library book selection will find valuable suggestions especially as to techniques in the work of educators in evaluating textbooks for use in the schools  the concept of readability can be sensibly discussed only in terms of the particular reader nothing is ever readable in general the intelligibility of anything in print depends upon the person who is trying to read it upon his reading skill his knowledge of the subject and his interest in it at the moment from the digest of lyman bryson remarks at the i convention of the american association for adult education ournal of adult education xii    possibilities for further investigation lie in a comparison of the process of institutional book selection with that of curriculum construction because of the extent to which the school men have carried their analysis of curriculum construction there is an abundant literature from which librarians can learn much see w w charters curriculum construction new york macmillan i henry harap the t chnique of curritulum making new york macmillan  and h e caswell and d s campbell curriculum development new york american book co 
 the library quarterly terms as these the announcements and reviews of new publications are scanned by the book selecting staff and those titles are ordered which appear to offer a possible contribution in furthering any one of the library objectives among any substantial group of patrons possessing certain psychosociological characteristics in common thus the public library in a small town would probably ignore the publications of the brookings institution but might buy the popular digests of them in the form of public affairs pamphlets once the material was received it would be examined by one or more staff members and a record of the analysis made unless this analysis when viewed against the known characteristics of the community indicated that the publication would serve to meet a want of any group of these people as defined by their distinguishing traits which conforms to one of the institution stated objectives the item should not be purchased any objective will have to be shifted in its main emphasis from time to time new data on the people of the community will be absorbed and the categories for the analysis of publications sharpened and adapted to these changes but the process as such will be the same probably no library will be able to buy all the books that it finds can pass this test but to determine which of these books to select is merely a matter of identifying those items that most nearly hit the center of the target to produce a desired effect on a given type of reader other considerations that would be  it should be emphasized that the theory of institutional book selection is not yet so well established that one can readily draw up practical procedures to put that theory into operation the devising of such procedures is a second and later step than the development and statement of the theory itself it is with this latter aspect that this note is primarily concerned furthermore such procedures must be fashioned so as to accord with the particular circumstances of the individual library and can be left to the ingenuity of practicing librarians once the theory itself has been demonstrated to be sound what is offered here in regard to practical procedures is only for purposes of illustration so note that groups not individuals are to be considered this is so because groups represent relatively permanent categories among which individual readers can and do shift but while an individual is one of a group he tends to read much the same material and for the same reasons as do his fellows in the group thus it is that though individuals and not groups do the reading institutional book selection is for the group and not for the individual see waples and tyler op cit pp xix xx i   and  
a note on the theory of book selection  involved in applying the library objectives are fairly obvious for example does a book that is being considered for purchase duplicate material already in the library is it readily obtainable elsewhere in the community for how large a group of patrons is it likely to be useful it might be objected that this institutional process of book selection is entirely too complicated and difficult to make it worth while for most public libraries to adopt to this three things can be said first this very process as described above is going on in every public library in america today but without the implications of the assumptions on which it rests being recognized as such every librarian who selects books has vaguely in mind the general purpose of the institution the general characteristics of the readers served usually ignoring the nonreaders and the general nature of the publication under consideration if this were not so it would be difficult to explain why the denver public library has not built up its holdings on marine architecture why the newark public library business branch does not have a fiction collection and why the new york public library does not stock the pulp literature that can be secured on the newsstand outside its doors since the process is going on under the surface to call for an awareness of the situation a self consciousness as to what is being done is to seek to make the criteria involved more objective more precise and more definite and to substitute valid generalizations for vague generalities this is the first step in science to uncover assumptions and to make clear what it is that you are trying to do and how you propose to go about it second the full development of the book selection process described here is important not alone for the selection of materials for the library shelves it is also a fundamental of adequate reader guidance ie the selection of books for a particular reader from what is available in the institution it was pointed out before that the whole process of institutional book selection must be focused on the individual reading situations that the library seeks to encourage the interrelationship between the two ends of the activity appears even more close
t the library quarterly when one examines its actual operation much of the data on reading and readers will be secured through the readers advisers and to them the content analysis of the publications selected will be as the breath of lifes and thisis as it should be for if the results sought by institutional book selection are in terms of individual reading situations then the role of the readers adviser in directly influencing the latter process turns on the data used and decisions made in connection with the former and finally to justify the present state of book selection practice in our public libraries is to ignore the dangers that lie in a policy of drift by a social institution that takes no steps to align its activities with the dominant trends of its age this institutional process of book selection not only demands a concrete statement by the librarian as to the objectives he seeks to achieve in itself a desirable by product but also contributes to the formation of that statement by the light it throws on the reading situation that the library faces in its community but most important of all this institutional aspect of book selection is designed to make effective the objectives set up for a library in the only sense that a public library can be effective and that is in terms of the reading satisfactions that it is able to effect in its community these are the potential contributions that an able and effective process of institutional book selection can offer si see jennie m flexner new experiences with books ournal of adult education vii
