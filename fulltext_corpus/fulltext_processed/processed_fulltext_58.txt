library and information science as a social science neutral and normative conceptions archie l dick when library education was institutionalized at universities in the s and s in the united states it pursued a social scientific path of disciplinary growth guided largely by perspectives in the philosophy of science in this way objectivity and neutrality became prominent professional ideals of library education a different conception of social science denies a disinterested outlook and provides the basis for recent challenges to the profession traditional perception of itself and its disciplinary growth this article explores alternately the neutral and normative conceptions of library and information science as a social scientific discipline introduction there is a deep seated ambivalence that characterizes the library profession today one manifestation of this is evident in the concern for the future of education in library and information science a recent response sets forth two options the first is that of the professional school in this approach a school of library science would have to articulate its mission and how its mission fits into the schema of the university as in the cases of schools of medicine law and engineering  p  the second approach is that of the academic unit this approach requires library science to articulate its intellectual contribution to the university    in unambiguous terms and to compete with other academic units on an equal footing  p  the distinction between these approaches lies in the perception of library and information science as an applied discipline oriented more narrowly to professional practice on the one hand and as a foundational discipline for the purposes of a broader basic education on the other it is especially in the latter approach that library and information science appears largely to  department of information science university of south africa po box  pretoria south africa  library quarterly vol  no  pp   x  by the university of chicago all rights reserved     
lis as a social science  be conceived as a social science and integrated into the mainstream of the university teaching and research program this conception is one possible source of the profession embattled collective mind set and may be traced to early attempts to institutionalize its education at universities and the subsequent disciplinary alignment with the social sciences one can only speculate on how things might have been if the other route had been taken that is if the profession had retained control over its education in libraries themselves under the auspices of professional library associations excellent historical accounts of the university approach are provided in the literature   what seems to be lacking are analyses of the historical emergence of and contemporary trends in the social sciences themselves as well as an appraisal of library and information science as a professional discipline using alternative conceptions of social science this article explores in support of the currently favored academicunit approach referred to earlier the profession predominant perception of itself as a social science in its contrasting neutral and normative conceptions prominent among the issues that continue to impede a sound development of the knowledge base of library and information science are those concerned with its disciplinary status and its disciplinary identity disciplinary status on the question of whether library and information science is a discipline opinion is still divided broadly into two camps one camp maintains the proposition that it is an interdisciplinary field of study and includes individuals who recommend opportunistic borrowing from other more established social sciences   the other camp rejects an ancillary or interdisciplinary status and affirms instead either that it is indeed a discipline in its own right or that it needs to become one   it is mostly in this latter camp that arguments for developing library and information science essentially along the lines of a social science may be found in this effort however library and information science tends to assume the key features of the so called traditional liberal social sciences this largely neutral conception requires it to sacrifice certain professional characteristics considered by some members of the opposing camp to be desirable and worth retaining value neutrality for example is a central quality of traditional liberal social sciences and highly regarded as a professional outlook for librarians its staunch support has led to the rejection of the normative and often prescriptive approaches recommended by interested outside observers as means of
 the library quarterly enhancing the profession social status these approaches advocate for example regulating the production of books controlling the flow of information and actively recommending good books   the vigor with which professional skepticism toward such interventionist strategies in the provision of information and information services is maintained is revealed in the observation that the role of the neutral provider is worth pursuing even if it may keep us forever out of the professional pantheon  p  what is deserving of our attention here is that this is not the only conception of social science there is no need to abandon disciplinary projects at the expense of professional status and authority newer scholarly developments hold out the promise of recovering normative dimensions and of reconciling the discipline with the profession before a discussion of the dominant view of the social sciences that frames much research and thought in library and information science and more recent reconceptions of this view an indication of the diversity of perceptions of the profession essential nature is worthwhile disciplinary identity the question regarding the essential disciplinary nature of library and information science or what kind of discipline it is is unsettled one possible source of this lack of consensus is the absence of a cohesive response to several calls for developing its philosophy on the one hand and its science on the other these twin requests tend to emphasize different conceptions of the profession projected disciplinary development although analyses of the philosophy of librarianship range from restatements of aims and functions to attempts to identify formal philosophical aspects in information work they share the common ideal of its broadest possible alignment with scholarship in general in these approaches the ideal is that of a learned profession analyses of the science of librarianship in their turn range from early views of librarianship as a science in the broad germanic sense to the recendy popular view of the profession as a social science especially in its imitation of positivist features of the natural sciences these approaches have in mind a scientific profession the failure to respond satisfactorily to these challenges has perhaps led to a state of affairs that prompted the remark that there is perhaps no profession or field of study less rooted in a coherent discipline  p  the perception of its ancillary status following an unfortunately reductionistic rationale moreover is expressed by william mcgrath
lis as a social science  library and information science is still largely a derivative profession not yet a discipline in its own right   we derive from or are a branch of education which itself depends on sociology and psychology and which in turn derive from biology chemistry and physics  p  an added difficulty surrounding the lack of or even loss of disciplinary identity of library and information science is the confusion generated by changes in names titles and labels the observation by margaret wilkinson is well worth heeding in this situation she asserts that the important thing is to be clear about our professional identity under whatever label  p  when viewed in the context of charles snow two cultures debate as separate fields of study library science and information science are characterized in divergent ways library science is identified for example as a science in the broad germanic sense of wissenschaft  a social science   p xiii an empirical science  p  a genuine albeit immature natural science  p  an applied vocationally directed social science which also contains elements that are related to the natural sciences and the humanities  p  an applied science  p  and an art even a fine art untouched by science  p  in its turn information science is also described in different ways as allied to the natural sciences  p  as an experimental science  p  as an interdiscipline  p  and as a social science  p  reinforcing this ambivalence connections with the humanities are emphasized in the conception of this field of study as librarianship with the qualification that umanistic is conceived in ways that do not prejudge it as belonging to one of two antithetical cultures  p  information science need not be excluded from this association with the humanities either margaret stieg for example argues that information science and the humanities are not inherently opposed it is only our mental constructs and metaphors that force them to such a relationship  p  it is essentially the two cultures dichotomy that has dominated our thinking along these lines and yet this metaphor is cast largely in social and political terms and ignores the whole question of intellectual relationships stieg suggests the need for more fruitful approaches for librarians information scientists and the educators in these disciplines  p  there is another category of perceptions that emphasize inclusiveness and continuity as distinct from the largely dichotomous views following the two cultures framework this category includes pierce butler association of library science with scholarship in its broadest sense  p   shiyali ranganathan notion of ekavakyata unity

lis as a social science  the neutral conception of social science it would seem that a picture of what it is to be a social science has held the library community captive this picture is one that reflects by and large some misunderstandings and the selective use of perspectives in the philosophy of science attempts to develop the scientific aspects of library and information science reveal the influence of selected thoughts of two philosophers of science who feature prominently in the professional literature namely karl popper and thomas kuhn the effects of more narrowly positivist approaches are also clearly discernible in the discipline in this pursuit of its social scientific status the profession embraced the ideals of neutrality and objectivity and sought to formulate laws and generalizations applicable to library related activities these ideals are considered to be linked to classical liberalism as it emerged in the nineteenth century and while they are appropriate for the liberal state they are not suited to the social sciences  p  issues involving values were thought to lie outside the sciences and hence the social sciences were expected to remain silent on questions or disputes concerning ultimate moral values  p  it becomes clear in an examination of the library profession search for its social scientific base following the philosophy of science path why objectivity and neutrality assumed such prominence as professional ideals the use of popper in library and information science selected ideas of karl popper   have been applied in aspects of library and information science and merit careful examination in popper the open society  and the poverty of historicism  there are discussions of variable length and detail of the philosophy of the social sciences it is especially in the latter work that his ideas on the social sciences become evident through a refutation of the doctrine of historicism or historical determinism namely his rebuttal of the proposition that the nature and structure and form of society must proceed from stage to stage by inevitable laws popper argues that the methods of the social sciences if properly understood are not fundamentally different from those of natural scientists he is convinced that the natural sciences have been mistakenly equated with logical positivism and that when this view has been emended they have much to commend themselves as models for the social sciences popper distinguishes scientific knowledge from nonscience or metaphysics by his principle of falsifiability  p  he claims that science
 the library quarterly grows not by mechanical induction of general propositions from accumulated reports of particular observations but by the imaginative formulation of hypotheses that are then tested and unless they elude all efforts to falsify them revised and replaced this process may be described as an on going dialectic of conjecture and refutation it is especially popper break with subjectivist epistemology that bertram brookes finds attractive for the theoretical development and subsequent disciplinary demarcation of information science  popper world three as one component of a three world ontology is the basis for an objective epistemology for information science instead of the commonsense theory of knowledge this third world of objective knowledge includes published literature and is objective in the sense that it is publicly observable and can be studied by scientific methods it becomes the proper study of information science for brookes but this narrower focus which neglects aspects related to subjective and social contexts of the creation and use of information has evoked critical response  also brookes own efforts to demarcate the field of information science and to supply it with appropriate mathematical tools tend to concentrate strongly on the published literatures of the natural sciences only don swanson seeks a more practical application of popper ideas in information retrieval in a study concerning the requirements for future catalogs swanson concludes that more effective search strategies would take into account guesswork or conjecture  p  swanson contends that the fundamental role of libraries in the growth of knowledge is to facilitate problem orientated access to knowledge that is to recognize popper method by which knowledge grows and to adapt bibliographic tools in accordance with this philosophical doctrine  what this really means is that the design of our retrieval tools should be guided by the conjecture and refutation view of the growth of knowledge  p  it would seem that librarians and information scientists adopt a selective approach in their application of popper ideas concentrating perhaps too exclusively on popper third world of objective knowledge as a means of supplying theoretical credibility to information science search for a legitimate area of inquiry other useful aspects of his philosophy tend to be overlooked the use of popperian ideas in information retrieval moreover leads to a growing emphasis on artifacts such as documents indexes and abstracts as valid third world items at the expense of people such as authors indexers abstractors and users the broad approaches that concentrate on these two distinctive sets of concerns are described as different paradigms and bring us to the application of kuhnian terms in the library profession
lis as a social science  the use of kuhn in library and information science thomas kuhn  doubted popper version of scientific progress instead of giving up a falsified scientific theory in favor of another on purely rational grounds kuhn maintained that sociological factors also played a significant role  the dilemma of rationality versus social influence was a central concern for kuhn and few social scientists realize that he struggled to preserve objectivity and rationality in science a recent article for example postulates that kuhn did not refute logical empiricism but rather that he introduced a historical picture of science  it is especially the notion of a paradigm that is applied in several different ways by social scientists to serve a variety of purposes in spite of kuhn clear statement that the acquisition of a paradigm marks the sign of maturity in the development of any given scientific field  p  library and information science theorists follow the example of most social scientists to use the term to examine and develop what they believe to be its scientific aspects paul roth confirms this trend among social scientists for kuhn the notion of a paradigm is part of his method for structuring the history of science social scientists have made the notion part of the definition of what it is to be a science which is not what kuhn intended  p  while kuhn holds that scientific research may proceed without paradigms  p  many social scientists are convinced that a paradigm specifies the defining criteria for science and that its absence necessarily inhibits scientific progress kuhn use of the term paradigm is interpreted in widely different ways and is even said to have been interpreted in many ways by kuhn himself  what is clear is that he intended it as a means to structure the history of science rather than an attempt to define or redefine science yet it would appear that social scientists either use kuhn to fill the methodological void left by the demise of positivism  p  or find him a very convenient stick with which to beat science  p  some even apply his incommensurability of paradigms thesis to support doctrines of cultural relativism and the bolder claims that science is arid and inappropriate to the understanding of human beings human nature and society the application of the term paradigm in library and information science appears to give credence to two questionable assumptions namely that the social sciences ought to follow the model of the natural sciences and that library and information science is a social science moreover the several conceptions of the so called paradigmatic nature of library and information science reveal precisely the absence of what a paradigm is supposed to signify namely theoretical consensus it has
 the library quarterly even been suggested that the multiplicity of paradigms in other social sciences may actually restrict interdisciplinary research and disallow cross pollination between research disciplines and an applied discipline such as library and information science in spite of the potential benefit of such mutual disciplinary interaction toward building the theory base which supports and enhances the library and information professions there is the caution that the first step in this process is to understand that existing paradigms may inhibit the interdisciplinary inquiry necessary to accomplish this task  p  the several uses of the term paradigm in library and information science literature as indicated earlier reflect widely divergent perceptions of its role and value library and information science is nonparadigmatic in the sense that it does not yet possess a truly scientific tradition  in this view references to paradigms are no more than indications of broad trends or conceptual metaphors to distinguish one school of thought from another and are better signified as perspectives models concepts and even ideologies such examples in the literature of library and information science include among others traditional reactive and idea system paradigms  non reductive paradigm  information paradigms  cognitive paradigm  cranfield paradigm  conversation as a new paradigm for librarianship  and organizational paradigm  lloyd houser and alvin schrader contend that it is premature to talk about paradigms in library science if they are not based on a scientific theory and scientific research activity  p  the view that library and information science is still a youthful science and hence preparadigmatic features strongly in the literature the professional discipline is perceived here as either a multiple paradigmatic science or a dual paradigmatic science a cogent explanation of the prescientific status that emanates from the existence of more than one paradigm in library and information science is advanced by johannes meijer  he suggests that a possible reason for the presence of a variety of paradigms that serve as points of departure for this discipline is its broadness two paradigms that meijer highlights are the administration and information paradigms it is especially the latter that has gained popularity and widespread acceptance but that has not yet been scientifically grounded as a defensible foundation for library and information science there is a need in meijer view for a central paradigm for the profession that will provide an insight into its goal and mission and enhance scientific activity and professional practice  p  as distinct from an emphasis on the need for a single central paradigm there is the perhaps contrary view that paradigmatic tolerance is required
lis as a social science  in library and information science johan olaisen calls for the need to explore several paradigms so that library and information science may transcend the functionalist or logical empiricist paradigm that has led it to be characterized as a one dimensional science  pp   in the area of information retrieval research david ellis maintains that the inherent categorial duality of its focus restricts the number of its paradigms to two namely the physical and the cognitive paradigms  in this basic irreducible duality the physical paradigm focuses on artifacts documents document representations abstracts indexes and databases while the cognitive paradigm concentrates on people authors indexers intermediaries and users ellis claims that this has retarded paradigm articulation and theoretical development in information retrieval research he states this categorial duality both explains the lack of success which has attended attempts to develop a strong theoretical science within a well developed paradigmatic framework and why progress in the field is likely only to be fragmentary or piecemeal  p  it would appear that the several views regarding the existence of one or more paradigms in library and information science assume that without a clear consensus there can be no normal scientific practice and hence no scientific revolutions and intellectual advances the perceived difficulty with this is that if theoretical consensus and kuhnian ormal science is regarded as the royal road to scientific achievement there may emerge a rationale for insisting that one research method for the good of the field should predominate  p  yet this is precisely what researchers in library and information science have recently sought to avoid   it is possible that the essential qualities of universality and broadness in this professional discipline precludes it from paradigmatic status since theoretical consensus is achieved only by sacrificing other competing paradigms  p  the normative conception of social science a well defined picture of library and information science characterized predominantly as a neutral social science in its traditional liberal conception emerges from the brief analysis presented above in its efforts to gain academic recognition it has largely followed the imitation by other social scientists of certain methods and ideas used in the natural sciences unfortunately as some commentators point out the social sciences have often copied inessential features of the natural sciences thereby missing the real benefit that the latter may offer john wisdom for example
 the library quarterly observes that the misunderstanding by several social scientists of logical positivism has led to a dismissal of empiricism as a valid approach to knowledge  the critique of positivism in library and information science inquiry is well documented and needs no discussion here   more important though the pretensions of value neutrality and objectivity as these are maintained in the neutral conception have led to a greater emphasis in library and information science activities on the means of service delivery rather than their ends that is whether they are desirable or morally valuable    this dimension of the ethical which is avoided in traditional liberal social sciences is openly confronted in the alternative conception in this view moral and political commitments are openly acknowledged as bases for undertaking research or for designing services this approach is admittedly more dangerous in that it is wide open to abuse an example that comes readily to mind is that of nazi anthropology the all important question to be answered is of course whose moral and political commitments or whose values should this conception of social science advance proponents of this alternative partisan approach in which the ideals of the good life for some individual or group are promoted and implemented argue that neutrality in any field is a matter of degree  p  this implies that breaking the silence on what morally ought to be is not a theoretical weakness but an honest confrontation with issues of moral philosophy in intellectual and cultural practice value freedom neutrality and indifference on this view is to be replaced by a conscious partiality this requires a reconception of the separation between researcher and object of research and of the degree of participation by ordinary people in intellectual and cultural inquiry the central proposition that normative approaches challenge is the enlightenment thesis that the growth of scientific knowledge is an unmixed good  p  the normative conception of social science seeks a more integral relationship between social scientific inquiry and the pursuit of the human good on this view the social sciences are described as areas of moral inquiry and even as moral theology  the growth of library and information science as a discipline no longer rests securely and uncontestedly on the foundation of science as a neutral and objective enterprise efforts at infusing the knowledge base of the profession with normative approaches are nonetheless marginal and poorly understood by many one reason for this is that such alternative strategies are loosely connected and have not gathered sufficient momentum to completely dislodge the neutral conception of social science it is well worth surveying the emergence of these strategies as they are found in recent professional literature although these alter
lis as a social science  native approaches share the view that there is no neutral platform for library and information science that is completely free of value commitments they envision its future disciplinary growth quite differently i have identified two broad camps which can be described as the reformers who do not totally reject the rational scientific enterprise of the enlightenment itself and the transformers who propose a more radical deconstruction of the notions of individuality and rationality that are viewed as historically constituted forms of domination the reformers one group of oppositional thinkers take their cue from contexualism which is based upon the challenge that confronted the mechanistic conception of the world that dominated western scientific thought from the second half of the seventeenth century to the end of the nineteenth century this challenge originated from research findings in several natural sciences most notably those in contemporary physics and its central concern was the elimination of the dualism of mind and matter or of knower from the object of knowledge the traditional perception of the fundamental separation between subject and object was gradually being replaced with a view that the subject and the object as components of the knowing process are dynamically linked with each other within a greater whole and that this holistic approach offered deeper insights into an understanding of a multidimensional reality in the social sciences the reaction to the mechanical worldview led to the emergence of a contextualistic theme that by and large paralleled the antipositivistic arguments advanced by philosophers of the natural sciences this conceptual reorientation in the social sciences has as its central focus the ideas of unity plurality spontaneity and ecological dependency of human activity  contextualism as a new look in the social sciences concentrates upon the the study of the individual in his or her natural surroundings in context in the culture and in the historical time  its basic themes have already been applied among others in such disciplines as psychology communication and theology a contextual approach to theory in library and information science that draws on the holistic ideas of the physicist david bohm is proposed by donald beagle  in his essay he emphasizes such features as wholeness interconnectedness environment and knowledge as a process he associates his interpretation of contextualism with the new physics and bohm notion of the implicate order and states that libraries are not some negentropic aberration from a fundamental law
 the library quarterly of cosmic disintegration but rather are an expression of an integrative law of underlying order perhaps by using this synthesis new world view we shall gain deeper and more coherent insights into the nature of knowledge and libraries  p  the contextualist theme is adjoined to a normative one in neighboring disciplinary writings regarding the notions of the information society and information age technologies certain communication theorists emphasize the movement beyond an optimist pessimist framework toward an alternative one that openly accommodates norms such as justice fairness and freedom this approach brings into view an ideal of responsible technology based on definite notions of the public good and a desirable society   emphasizing the relevance of contextualism but underscoring more strongly the lived experiences and social construction of reality by marginalized sections of society another group of authors advocate approaches to library and information services and library education that depart from the traditional models in order to establish those that highlight collective identities one strand in this category of approaches refer to development librarianship appropriate librarianship contextual librarianship and afrocentric models   to emphasize greater sensitivity to local culture local communities and indigenous knowledge bases multicultural librarianship may also be placed here although ambivalence characterizes the view of the librarian intermediary role in rendering services to minority groups  another strand focuses principally on the gender biases inherent in traditional library thinking this feminist outlook affirms an outright rejection of an androcentric and value free library and information science and calls for a rethinking of its philosophy to acknowledge women ways of knowing since they are the profession majority anyway  p   the reform minded camp hopes to improve library and information science as a social science by emending mistakes and omissions the adherents have in mind the addition of new subject matter theories and methods complementary to existing ones the incorporation of these ideas does not require a basic recasting of library and information science as a part of the rational project of the enlightenment but a repositioning of the social dimension of human experience as pivotal in that project they wish to retain the notion of objectivity in the form of a so called strong objectivity the argument is that the demise of neutrality should not give way to an epistemological relativism but calls for an exploration of strategies that detect systematically distorting assumptions that have proved most powerful in the projects of marginalized groups  p 
lis as a social science  the transformers if the central idea for the reformers is that of incorporation the principal proposition of the more radical transformers is one of emancipation they contend that the library profession ought to examine critically the interests and values that its discipline subscribes to by concealing others the apparent avoidance of values according to them is a strong value commitment itself and the seemingly needless exercise of self reflection is little more than a tactical ploy to replicate itself following michel foucault analysis of power and knowledge this camp submits that the constitution of a specific field of knowledge is a political act which simultaneously configures a field of ignorance  p   p  the professional discipline they envision should do the following  support the liberation of library users from a virtual conceptual tyranny over access  p  drawing on poststructuralist analyses of theories of knowledge and language some deconstruct traditional positivist approaches to reading  and subject access   they highlight the deep assumptions of many professional tasks to reveal the scope and nature of bias embedded in selection policies and tools of access such as indexes and catalogs they maintain that the reproduction of existing ideas and thoughts are facilitated through traditional classification schemes and indexes whereas innovative scholarship is nearly impossible  p  categorization structures moreover not only reflect offensive attitudes toward minorities but inhibit investigation into sensitive areas of race relations as well   improve the critical consciousness of librarians as intermediaries concerning the way in which library materials are linked to the power and privilege of certain classes to represent the world through books in ways that serve their interests  p  critical theory supplies the intellectual thrust for examining how librarians can gain an insight into their unavoidable involvement in cultural activities that promote certain perspectives and suppress others it allows a more suitable context for questioning the apolitical servants of the people perception of librarians role by locating their professional tasks within larger educational political and cultural contexts that shape canon making curriculum development public opinion formation agendas for public debate competing claims to valid knowledge the entrenchment of cultural styles and so forth  assist library educators to appreciate how power inequities are inscribed into the heart of lis library and information science theory  p  using the technique of discourse analysis bernd frohmann demonstrates how the cognitive viewpoint gained a firm theoretical foothold

lis as a social science  a trenchant critique of the profession claim to value neutrality their own essential conception of partisan perspectives that do not at the same time sacrifice validity and objectivity still requires a clearer delineation what is clear is that this patently normative conception of social science has revived the early debate as to whether the library profession is essentially a disinterested social enterprise or a committed educational enterprise at this point one can only speculate how the new normative approaches will influence future disciplinary development and professional practice one difference will be a critical reconsideration of concepts such as neutrality objectivity freedom and equality in the context of library thought and practice another difference will be a sharper awareness of the subtle ways in which power marshals certain prejudices in support of itself under seemingly innocuous guises one thinks here for example of opposing views regarding the neutrality of information technology or retrieval tools finally the new normative approaches will help to highlight the neglected role of librarians as intellectuals in the public domain and the accompanying ethical challenges of making the world a better place in which to live the reconciliation of moral dimensions of library theory and practice with issues of validity and objectivity poses a stiff challenge this overview of the stirrings of ferment in the field of library and information science reflects my own unsettled position and my attempt to come to grips with these forces of transformation perhaps ambivalence is a feature of the times in which we live if the library profession nonetheless continues to regard itself predominantly as a social science deserving of higher study and as an integral part of the academy then there is still much to be done references  hurt charlie d the future of library science in higher education a crossroads for library science and librarianship in advances in librarianhip vol  edited by irene p godden pp   san diego calif academic press   stieg margaret f change and challenge in library and information science education chicago american library association   williamson charles c the wiuiaumson reports of  and  metuchen nj scarecrow   rawski conrad h the interdisciplinarity of librarianship in toward a theory of librarianship papers in honor of jesse hauk shera edited by c rawski pp   metuchen nj scarecrow   harris michael h and itoga masaru becoming critical for a theory of purpose and necessity in american librarianship in library and information science research
