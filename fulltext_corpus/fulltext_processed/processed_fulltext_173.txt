the application of the usability approach   about the author myke gluckis assistant professor school of information studies florida state university manuscript received july   accepted october   the usability approach to information system product development and evaluation evolved from a combination of human factors engineering a subfield of industrial engineering and applied and cognitive psychology human factors engineering or ergonomics studies the ability of humans to employ tools or effect processes in the workplace without incurring physical harm from their use ergonomics investigates physical and perceptual issues such as the design of low stress chairs and work surfaces placement of tool receptacles at a workbench selection of color combinations to provide effective computer monitor contrast and lighting determination of instrument cluster placement within a fighter plane cockpit and the determination of load lifting methods to reduce the likelihood of lower back pain cognitive psychology may also be invoked in these and other scenarios to assist information workers and seekers in reducing memory demands cognitive processing time and the amount of information overload reducing these demands and effort makes human execution of information related tasks less prone to error and decreases the time for accomplishing the given tasks the roots of usability can thus be traced to the  workplace time and motion analyses of taylor and to the processing demands exposed by gestalt psychology as computers became more common in the workplace design of computer interfaces and the desire to move toward more user centered information systems led workers in the computer field to adopt and adapt the goals concepts and methods of human factors engineering and psychology  such efforts have led to the development of a separate field shared by computer science industrial psychology and information systems called usability as further evidence of these developments several organizations are now dedicated to usability eg usability professionals association and other groups actively recruit members with usability specialties or careers eg computer human interaction special interest group sigchi of the association for computing machinery the traditional usability approach held a limited yet effective view of humans as information processors because of its roots in engineering and psychology the traditional usability approach monitored the performance of a small sample of workers on a task typically capturing their time on tasks and their rate of errors in executing the tasks much work in applying the usability approach remains centered around the careful selection of subjects composition of subject tested tasks and assessing only performance time and error rates the traditional usability approach based in these roots was spurred on by the dual yet sometimes competing desires to be  the servant of users of systems as opposed to being subservient to the technical aspects and  cost effective in a commercial setting occasionally usability laboratories will post signs stating the user is always right or the user stupid the user based on these efforts and the general attitude of usspring 
 journal of education for library and information science ability professionals usability analysts reasonably claim to be the user advocates for the world of information system development and deployment with increased engagement with the user less impoverished views of humans have been employed within usability analysis however the application of rich deep reliable and valid perspectives of humans is still uneven among researchers in the usability field these varied views of a human engaged in information work have led to novel and deep concepts and methods of design of systems interfaces and collaborative work such varied conceptualizations include participatory design contextual design and analysis of the process of design as analysis of artifacts others have more abstract metaphors for development and human interaction with machines such as that of a theatrical production social process or a political process thus views of the human within the usability approach have ranged from seeing people as mere error and time machines to accepting users as sensitive intelligent agents who are creating a structured routinized daily life while continually confronting threats to their ontological security and overcoming them in creative ways the usability approach is applied at several different stages of the information system or product development and deployment cycle the umbrella term usability approach is used here to include usability engineering analysis and testing at different stages different names have been applied to the application of usability methods if usability techniques are used in the preliminary design and early prototyping stage the application has been called usability engineering later in the design or early product development stage it has been called usability analysis or inspection and as an evaluation process it has been labeled usability testing however these labels are inconsistently applied in general during the design stage more emphasis has been placed on the usefulness effectiveness issues and less on usableness while the evaluation process has included more emphasis on the usableness than on the usefulness yet both aspects are evaluated at all phases the emphasis on effectiveness early and efficiency later may seem inverted however this pattern is not awkward if one thinks about design as achieving the goal effectivenessusefulness and evaluation as assessing how well resources are used usableness in accomplishing the task the debate over the balance of usefulness and usableness at all stages continues within the usability field the view of the user as well as the methods chosen to investigate usability will often vary as the usability approach is utilized at these differing stages both artificial laboratory and natural environments eg offices meeting rooms have been chosen as milieus for observing and analyzing the usability of information systems products and interfaces the debate over location or setting for data collection is common in research it is based on the effects of varying levels of intrusion or distortion of human behavior created when the subjects are observed those in favor of laboratory settings wish to maintain more control over the variables and to unconfound them on the other hand those wishing to collect data in more natural settings hope to observe the holistic activity and are willing to tolerate the random and unanticipated environmental influences to better understand the phenomenological aspects of real people doing real work both settings are of value and often both can be effective within the same study for example observing volume  number

 journal of education for library and information science such products is less technologically experienced and less interested in the inner workings of the tools than in the past they are more driven by the problem that brought them to the system than by how the system works current users are increasingly different from the designers of these systems than had been the case in the past  many organizations take it for granted that common sense is sufficient to provide a good design instead of acknowledging the difficult and unpredictable nature and the unintended consequences of the design process petroski makes a strong case that technological improvements are not the result of form following function but of hard work in trial and error processes in the laboratory marketplace and workplace  the development of information products and systems is complex and often done by multiple groups or teams within an organization that frequently do not integrate their efforts effectively the rush to get to market to beat the competition and the need for venture and technology companies to maintain high cash flow shorten product development cycles these shortened cycles favor the completion of technical aspects over the users ultimate needs the we can put that in the next version syndrome  design and technical implementation require different skill sets today developers tend to have an abundance of technical or construction skills while they all too often lack good design skills the distinction between the work of architects and the work of carpenters in designing and building a house is a reasonable analogy to the different skill sets needed but often lacking in the development of information products systems and interfaces it is clear that there are good reasons for applying the usability approach and yet there are many pressures not to apply it unfortunately shortterm cost savings may obviate increased product effectiveness product loyalty or long term revenue streams traditional methods a very brief overview of the methods used in the usability approach to conduct usability testing analysis and engineering is provided in this section rubin suggests a six step general scheme for applying the usability approach at any of the stages suggested earlier the development of a test plan selecting and engaging participant subjects preparation of materials conducting the testing with participants debriefing the participants and analysis of the findings and reporting recommendations within this framework the most common and general method for usability assessment involves testing subjects in a laboratory or office setting on a prepared set of tasks while monitoring their actions the design and selection of tasks for testing are a major creative element in the usability approach and require the investigator to have a thorough understanding of the goals of the user and the role of the tool to be tested in meeting those user centered goals further the recording of observations of users interactions during the usability tests ranges from a researcher merely taking notes while observing the subject to audioor videotaping while subjects talk aloud as they perform tasks compound records of the interactions often include recording computer keyboard strokes and mouse clicks time stamped videotape of computer screen images volume  number 
the application of the usability approach  and video images from multiple angles of the researcherparticipant interaction these more elaborate compound records are usually collected in a specially designed laboratory and are increasingly being done with portable equipment in more natural settings elaborate recording is costly and timeconsuming as it requires expensive computer and videotape equipment as well as extensive efforts in videotape analysis however small studies with observation and note taking on reasonably broad tasks can be quite illuminating and an effective use of the usability approach to provide quality results for low to moderate investments of time personnel and money for libraries and information centers the goals operators methods and selection goms rules construct or method serves as an example of one of the more reflective techniques supporting the usability approach goms involves creating a listing of possible user goals and subgoals listing the operators that users have available as motor perceptual or cognitive primitives listing the methods that users employ to compose sequences of these operators to achieve the goals or subgoals and creating the list of selection rules necessary to assist the user to decide what to do next if the user has several goals pending or if there are several methods that will accomplish the same goal time for accomplishing a given task is calculated by adding the time for each individual step of the task for example a user goal of obtaining a full text document after having seen an abstract or extract on the internet might have operators of mouse clicking looking at the menu bar and remembering the filename the method might be composed of moving the cursor to the right word and double clicking the mouse while selection rules might involve backspacing to retype the filename or cutting and retyping a new filename the shortcomings of the goms approach are known yet goms as with other more reflective usability techniques has been of benefit in analyzing user interfaces as well as in practical case studies there are other theoretically driven usability techniques and methods that have gained favor and have been used to advantage in various settings and are currently being researched in their own right usability methods and uses in libraries and information center workplaces library and information centers may greatly benefit from at least two practical methods of the usability approach rapid prototyping and focus groups are low cost and have been shown to be effective in a range of studies and settings rapid prototyping involves the development of mockups of screen images web pages or report page layouts these rough sketches in paper cardboard or plastic can be used to test and interview potential users for example many academic libraries have customized opac screens for basic instructions help and searching commands and options these instructions and commands are often displayed in menus constrained by the proprietary software however mockups of the screens could be used with a small sample of patrons to eliminate the most inefficient aspects of early designs a small sample of users often six to fifteen participants sufficient for applying t statistics can be asked to walk through the steps they would follow to accomplish several standard tasks using the mockups these walkthroughs enable the implementation team to better understand the impact of spring 
 journal of education for library and information science the designs for real patrons rapid prototyping provides a wealth of real user input at very low cost in a short time and eliminates having to rely on best guesses as to what will be needed and used by patrons rapid prototyping in collaboration with patrons for the design of opac menus or internet web pages will not diagnose all of the complexity in the use of the interface however rapid prototyping can help spot the glaring problems that designers and experts and yes librarians have trouble assessing a priori but that users will encounter nonetheless such techniques can be effectively used with four to ten participants without being overly concerned with the statistical validity yet emphasizing the anomalies users encounter while engaged with the mockups results from rapid prototyping studies can reduce the need for bibliographic instruction and patron education in the long run librarians can assist patrons with their information needs rather than teach the vagaries of a system with low usability further rapid prototyping iterations can be accomplished with participant patrons or appropriate staff in office areas of the library or information center this can be done repeatedly at low cost with short turnaround time as the designs are changed and modifications suggested focus groups are a second usability method that can be very effective in library and information centers for aiding in selection or deployment of products or services groups of six to twelve participants led by a trained facilitator discuss the issues surrounding the implementation and use of information systems or products the discussion may be aided by having mockups or the real product demonstrated prior to the discussion and keeping the mockup at hand for participants to refer to as the discussion proceeds the sessions usually convene in small conference rooms and use a tape recorder to refresh the investigator memory the facilitator focuses the discussion on key aspects of the product or system that the implementation or selection team feels would provide them with the most meaningful input the facilitator also pursues issues and details raised by the participants and explores differing positions within the group focus group facilitators may be trained by reading several good books on the method and conducting a few role playing simulations as practice or they may be sent to workshops specifically designed to train focus group facilitators competent facilitators can be developed inhouse at nominal cost and effort with excellent return on investment both of these methods rapid prototyping and focus groups are rather coarse tools they will not identify all the issues in the designs but they can help a selection or implementation team to avoid many obvious and some subtle errors at a very low cost both methods may be conducted in office settings and without high tech recording and monitoring equipment while this paper does not address the cost justification of the usability approach others provide strong evidence for the financial viability of the usability approach these two methods may be used for assessing a range of information system services and products prior to selection or deployment whether these products are for technical services reference provision administrative support or for patron access they can be used to assess computerized products such as opacs children catalogs cd roms web pages electronic databases digital atlases multimedia products or online services as well as manual materials such as paper journals and atlases indexes bibliographies and other major reference sources in print such methods can be used to assess both the forvolume  number
