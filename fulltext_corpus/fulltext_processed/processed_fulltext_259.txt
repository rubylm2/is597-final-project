journal of education for library and information science petencies and what is the role of libraries and information centers in the learning society while library and information science education has been addressed in the professional literature the content of an educational program has been discussed only in the most general terms recent articles by derr morehead white  battin and koenig addressed the importance of theory and the relative merit of skills in the preparation of librarians also king research inc has studied the competencies of librarians in a variety of settings  school public academic and special libraries however a study of current competencies and practices may not provide the framework for educating future librarians and other information professionals these questions remain what should be the content of library and information science education what theory should be taught and how much practice or skills should be part of a graduate program for the preparation of library and information professionals how much specialization should be encouraged this concern for content of professional education extends to information professionals in nonlibrary positions a recent conference at emporia state university assembled practitioners and educators from information systems information resource management archives management records management and library and information science papers presented and ensuing discussions indicated a widespread concern for the content of education for information professionals the debate on the core knowledge essential for professional education is not restricted to the library educators therefore in this paper libraries is used in the broadest context to include various types of information agencies managed by librarians appropriately educated professionals the purpose of this paper is to examine the current and apparent future roles of librarians within the context of modern society and to articulate the knowledge theory skills and attitudes which could be packaged in the curriculum of a professional school of library and information science beginning with an analysis of the role of information and libraries in a learning society the library profession rationale for professional education is used as a philosophical foundation for a model curriculum the model presented in this paper proposes resolution to the educational questions raised above while other models exist and still others will be forthcoming this model is presented to facilitate debate thought and perhaps progress in library and information science education 
professional education for the learning society role of librarians in society the application of knowledge is a matter of critical concern in a postindstrial society a knowledge based society in their discussion of our new society holzner and marx asserted that knowledge workers such as scientists and professionals occupy a particularly important place ina society which is marked by rapid change a proliferation of knowledge and a technological boom the creation organization dissemination and retrieval of information and knowledge is critical holzner and marx summarized the sociological attributes of modern society as follows  a service economy of predominantly white collar workers  a highly educated specialized technical scientific and professional personnel  a central role for technology and knowledge  an important role for knowledge workers such as professionals and scientists  a social memory with infinite detail  greater stress on scientific or proven knowledge  a learning society which must learn to learn and adapt to change thoughout life  stress on the organized application of knowledge within the context of this rapidly changing knowledge centered society libraries and other information agencies should play a central role shera has described that role as communicating knowledge the library is a vital link in the communication systems of any society without communication there can be no society and without some form of graphic record and a means for the preservation of that record there can be no enduring culture libraries facilitate the communication of ideas and knowledge of one society to another and from one generation to the next ideas and knowledge are recorded and preserved on graphic records enabling their collection organization storage and retrieval by contemporaries or by succeeding generations with the emergence of the computer and its capability for the storage and retrieval of vast amounts of information the traditional role of librarians is complicated and their role must be redefined or at least clarified because of the vast amounts of information generated and stored in recent years selection organization and retrieval for the purpose of research education and decision making is increasingly more complex also the most efficient use of information available is becoming a greater challenge librarians must attempt to select the relevant information the nuggets from among the vast 
journal of education for library and information sciknck amounts available if necessary the librarian must be able to synthesize this information for the ready use of clients so that the information is used efficiently in order to fulfill the library societal role in modern society librarians must be more involved in the selection and utilization of information by the library constituents the education for library and information professionals must prepare individuals to assume this more active role coping with new technology and vast amounts of information professional education must prepare individuals to become change agents in a profession which may be altered radically during the career of an individual the necessary theories skills and undergraduate background for future library and information professionals are discussed below guidelines for library professional education in  the american library association ala council adopted the following definition of professional the title librarian carries with it the connotation of professional in the sense that professional tasks are those which require a special background and education on the basis of which library needs are identified problems are analyzed goals are set and original and creative solutions are formulated for them integrating theory into practice and planning organizing communicating and administering successful programs of service to users of the library materials and services in defining services to users the professional person recognizes potential users as well as current ones and designs services which will reach all who could benefit from them this professional definition used as the basis for standards for accreditation of library professional schools indicates that a profession does need certain competencies which are skill level eg operating media hardware and organizing information however other competencies require higher level thinking or cognitive processes eg information needs analysis problem solving goal setting planning communicating and managing indeed the definition in its totality and in spirit indicates that a library professional is in every sense a manager and leader standards for accreditation adopted by the ala council june   and implemented january    require professional library education programs to provide the educational experiences described in the above statement while these standards currently are being studied for possible revision they will be considered here as they are the current basis for evaluation of professional schools the standard for a curriculum includes the following guidelines for a professional course of study the curriculum should be a unified whole rather than an aggregate of courses it should  stress understanding rather than rote learning of facts principles and skills rather than routines  emphasize the significance and functions of the subjects taught  
professional education for the learning society reflect the findings of a basic and applied research in librarianship and related disciplines  respond to current trends in library development and professional education  promote continuous professional growth the professional education program articulated by greerli l is a oneyear graduate program which prepares professionals as defined by the american library association and the williamson report this curriculum as implemented at the university of southern california in  accredited by the american library association in  and replicated with modifications at emporia state university in  has been cited by dyer and oonnor and cronin in recent studies of library education programs the conceptual framework of that curriculum is presented here as a response to the continuing debate regarding skills versus theory in professional education and as a model for library and information science education programs elements of this program are  a solid general undergraduate education  prerequisite skills level professional courses  a core of theory and tool courses for individual specialization these elements are described below undergraduate education the williamson report commissioned by the carnegie corporation to study the education of library workers recommended the requirement of an approved college course of four years for admission to a professional school for librarians since  the american library association has accredited only master degree programs and the present standards for accreditation state that admission to professional programs should normally be limited to holders of the bachelor degree representing a broad academic education from an accredited institution the standards do provide for students with subject specialization indeed such specialization is often desired for some entry level positions as noted by asheim it is also at the undergraduate level that some skills required of information professionals can be learned conant summarized the debate surrounding the introduction of professional skills courses at the undergraduate level and recommended moving some introductory and orientation material to an undergraduate level leaving only graduate level courses in the master degree programs these courses available to upper division undergraduate students should enable students to  understand clerical operations and basic terms common to the operation of libraries and information centers  operate media hardware and produce software common to most libraries and information centers 
journal of education for library and information science  evaluate and use printed information sources common to most libraries and information centers  understand and use the cataloging data bases and tools most common in libraries  understand and use new technology and online data bases students may meet these prerequisite requirements through appropriate course work at usc these courses are self paced laboratories and at esu they are courses through work experience or through successful completion of an exemption examination these are tasks or skills which may be performed regularly by a library assistant or technician using ala designations for library workers the professional supervises clerks and paraprofessionals in these tasks and asheim noted some of the work done by first level professionals will be similar to that of high level library assistants but the distinction lies in the greater dependence upon principles and specialized skills uniquely related to librarianship and information science in summary selected skills courses may be taken as part of a baccalaureate degree program or more often taken as prerequisite courses core theory and tools courses the definition of a professional discussed above and articulated in library education and manpower stresses the leadership role of the professional according to that definition the professional must identify and diagnose information needs and the professional person recognizes potential users as well as current ones based on this needs assessment the professional analyzes problems sets goals and finds original and creative solutions integrating theory into practice translating this definition into a graduate curriculum suggests the following objectives for a core of courses required of a prospective librarian or other information professional working in any environment school college business etc an entry level professional should be able to  articulate a philosophy of the library and information professions the prospective librarian must assess hisher own value system compare it to the values promoted within the profession through its literature and formal statements eg library bill of rights ethics statement the student must begin formulating a professional philosophy which will provide a framework for setting priorities and interacting with the profession this philosophy enables the professional to have a wide view of the profession as recommended by shera the professional understands the role of the library in its community and within society generally this 
professional education for the learning society philosophy enables the professional to make sound decisions providing the value system which will influence future decisions a professional philosophy is necessary for the change agent role of librarians  recognize basic human behavior patterns applied to the communication of information while the first objective relates to the librarian the second concerns the user or consumer of information the prospective librarian must be familiar with psychological theories associated with individual needs selection processing and use of information a psychology course applied to the libraryinformation profession is somewhat analogous to educational psychology  a selected segment of behavioral science applied to the education profession the library professional who is aware of existing theories on individual needs and behavior patterns can better diagnose needs and design and implement services that integrate more effectively clientele behaviors and constraints this course addresses shera concern it is important to librarians that they be supported as much as possible by an understanding of those psychological and other mental processes through which the individual receives and assimilates knowledge that they know as much as can be known given our present limitations of the cognitive process  comprehend the theory and general patterns of information transfer in society the focus of library service has been on individuals and objective  concerns study of the individual yet every individual who uses a library is a member of societal groups playing several roles and working within the context of those subsocieties that group may be a profession a discipline or member of a group because of age race etc greer applies the term information transfer to the structure of unique social patterns and systems associated with the creation recording production organization dissemination use and preservation of information by groups shera identified the need for this study we are concerned here with a body of knowledge about knowledge itself how knowledge has developed and been augmented has long been a subject of study but how knowledge is coordinated integrated and put to work is yet an almost unrecognized field of investigation although shera used the term knowledge and green uses information defined as recorded knowledge the societal implications of information is the focus of this curriculum objective this course among other things explores the general patterns with some specific examples of creation dissemination and organization of information in society included are such topics as censorship publishing and other means of recording knowledge bibliographic control and information policy as these influence enhance or inhibit those general patterns of information transfer all from a societal point of view
