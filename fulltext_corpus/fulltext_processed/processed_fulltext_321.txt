poverty prejudice and the public library ewald b nyquist et me begin by emphasizing four current trends that affect us all id and have a high degree of relevance for the work of public libraries first there is the factor of interlocking complexity just as we live in a culture that is polarized around the scientific revolution so do we live in one that puts a premium on organization on system on co operation between units having mutual or overlapping interests it is a day of calculated interdependence of involvement of planned togetherness whether we like it or not not enough librarians realize that they can no longer preside over institutions or agencies in splendid isolation librarianship has too often been and still is a many splintered thing we do not have enough librarians who are prepared by education experience or by inclination to cope with the often bewildering interlocking complexity of their environment traditional forms of institutional autonomy are being displaced by emerging patterns that emphasize interdependence rather than independence in the expansion and improvement of education and library work but it is not only a problem of cooperation or sharing of responsibility between like institutions in formal education for instance state education departments and local school officials must learn to establish constructive relationships with the federal government with private and parochial institutions with private and public agencies in such fields as health welfare housing recreation and comimuniity planniiag with business and industry labor and with the other educational resources that have hitherto stood on the periphery of the formal teaching and learning process such as museums libraries educational television zoos the performing arts and so on and finally in this day of interlocking complexity when we seem to find only half solutions to the problems of our own human aggregation let us be firmly cormmitted to providing a lateral outreach to the poor and to the disadvantaged to involving them in a shared responsibility for planning and implementing community action programs too long we have either ignored the poor or else have provided welfare services to the poor and the disadvantaged on the basis of superior inferior authority relationships divorced from the goal of developing human resources and the independence and autonomy of the individual human being means and ends have been confused let us listen for a moment to professor dan wv dodson of new york iuniversity when he spoke at a conference we called on the role of public libraries in developing services for the disadvantaged are our services simply the squirting on of more welfare does our interest stem simply from the concern that we must keep the tension controlled with a little more and so on or is it to release the human potential if it is to release the human potential we must run some calculated risk if people are going to take power and move from self direction out of this will come the need for the library to serv
poverty prejudice and the public library  ice some movements that are going to be autonomous in themselves and not simply progranms of service of welfare agencies that get together and coordinate and wrap up their services in a cartel kind of arrangement in other words the biggest issue we are dealing with is not the issue of more service as important as this is but of some undergirding ideology that gives life structure and meaning and purpose one that moves people towards some autonomous goals which cause them to fight back and not be willing quite so rapidly to surrender their potency in this where do we stand as an institution of service to the community are we committed to helping all people to pursue these autonomous kinds of goals or are we there as representatives also of the power order to serve sufficiently well that we keep people tranquilized these days then educators and librarians and i use those terms synonymously must learn that it takes at least two to tangle the new era is one of going steady librarians no longer walk alone there is as someone has predicted a bright future for complexity and he might have added ambiguity for assisting in filling out the educational mosaic of the great society is not without both next let me speak of the national interest in education and library work and of the concept of creative federalism why has the federal government assumed a much larger role in education and library affairs displacing the importance of individual states and localities as one writer has put it there is no mystery about why the powers of the federal government have been constantly growing and the powers of the states constantly declining one reason is that in our increasingly complex and interlocking society problems that once could be dealt with on a state basis flowed over state lines and had to be handled on a national basis secondly most states abandoned their powers by failing to exercise them and thus forced their people to turn to washington for help and services their states refused to provide it is in the national interest to develop to the fullest the capacity of our libraries to preserve enlarge and disseminate man knowledge states and localities and private and single institutions no longer can by themselves support libraries to the extent necessary for enhancing private individual benefit and the common good the most significant development in american education is the increased awareness of education importance to the achievement of our national goals and of a national commitment to raising the quality of our educational enterprise thus the federal government in recent years has generously increased its funding for a variety of library activities in elementary and secondary schools in colleges and universities in the public libraries and at the state level the availability of massive categorical federal aid to correct areas of critical weakness forces new relationships indicative these days of the concern with the meaning of the federal government growing participation in education is the preoccupation with the term creative federalism it conceives of a partnership a family of governments a federal state local sharing of responsibility joint effort and mutual development of new activities rather than a strict separation of powers and direct federal action it acknowledges the importance of state and local levels of governance with their accompanying powers and responsibilities but affirms the primacy of the federal government the concept presumes to be more sensitive to the rapidly changing pressures and powers in an increasingly pluralistic society power and control in education are not a fixed absolute pool a static commodity a defined quantum of
 the library quarterly power the entrance of the federal government into education and library affairs does not diminish the power of the states localities or local institutions it enlarges it the new notion of federalism then calls for a sharing of responsibility for carrying out an important public purpose that all have in common and that none could achieve as well without the co operation of the others it is mutually enriching and has a multiplier effect on its participants it depends upon co operation creative tension conflict and constructive criticism for its continued viability third i shall discuss briefly urbanization in the early part of the twentieth century a marked movement of people from rural to urban areas took place then at mid century three interrelated population movements affected cities many moved to suburban living in metropolitan areas disadvantaged persons flowed from other states to the core areas of central cities and puerto rican citizens moved to the larger cities particularly new york city today nearly  per cent of americans live in  metropolitan centers by  it is estimated that  per cent of the nation population will live in urban areas these areas are expanding into vast urban complexities spreading from a central core containing the financial commercial and legal headquarters of the area through nearby exclusive prosperous neighborhoods out into a gray area of deteriorating residential and decaying industrial and commercial neighborhoods with all of this encircled by miles and miles of residential suburbia the population growth within this complex has been uneven in the decade between the  and the  census the population of some major cities including chicago new york philadelphia and st louis decreased while their total metropolitan populations were expanding the suburbs have had to absorb the enormous growth in metropolitan populations the growing urbanization of our society is one of the outstanding characteristics of our age for many years our american cities have been undergoing a social and economic revolution the most obvious sign has been the decline of the central city the decline contrary to popular belief has not been brought about by the influx of the new migrants the negro the puerto rican the mexican those groups primarily with a high percentage of unskilled and culturally handicapped but by the abandonment of responsibility by the white majority and the flight of industry and the white middle class families to more affluent suburbs thus leaving the cities shorn not only of needed tax revenues but of part of its leadership as john gardner has said recently we are going to have to do more than build bridges between the inner city and its opulent periphery we need a totally new concept of metropolitan organization the urban schools and libraries have been left with the task of serving undue proportions of those hardest to educate the children of the poor the migrant and the ghetto and have also had to attempt this task in an atmosphere of rejection and apathy by the most influential segment of society thus the recent history of urban education has been one of a vicious circle of diminishing support and deterioration in quality it is estimated that by  negroes and puerto ricans will make up  per
poverty prejudice and the public library  cent of new york city population and comprise  per cent of the borough of manhattan that chicago will be  per cent negro and st louis  per cent and we need to remind ourselves that about  per cent of the children in the public schools of washington dc are negro i like to quote again from professor dan dodson the cities have always been the great civilizing force in cultures they brought the poor and the humble the despised and the outcast the uneducated the uncouth to the great encounters and in one or two generations produced out of them urbane humane people this has been the function the role of the city in history this process is unfolding before our eyes here the big problem it seems to me is the extent of the problem in so short a period of time there are a million more people living in the slums of our large cities than live on all farms and a million more to come the history of civilization also is that they have attracted the marginal but choked them down because they found it easier to keep these people amused than to integrate them purposefully into the life of the community ultimately bread and circuses produced such attrition of resource that civilization fell of its own weight what he seems to be saying is that there is an inverse correlation between increasing urbanization and urbanity everybody or nearly everybody has gone to town so to speak and the new frontier in education is elsewhere it is not in the developing rural lands nor in the clean comfortable antiseptic suburbs the excitement the cutting edge of things in education today is in the dusty streets of urban areas the large cities and in the slums there is where the action is there is where we need the boldest the most creative and the best of our educators and librarians if we are to fill out the mosaic of a still distant great society it is in these areas where the disadvantaged are and where one can most truly become an innovator fourth and finally let me speak of racial isolation and racial integration as issues in and of themselves aside from urbanization i shall speak to the need for the greatest innovation of all essential for correcting the most glaring hypocrisy today in american education the hypocrisy a stench in the nostrils of the national community is the gaping distance between our professed historical belief in equality of access to educational opportunity for all our children and youth on the one hand and our actual provisions for what is usually called in a transport of euphemism the disadvantaged on the other and let us not delude ourselves as to who the disadvantaged are they are primarily the american negro we need to develop as someone has said a special capacity for outrage at the injustice done to the american negro the corrective innovation about which the public is still consumed by apathy is integration in its fullest almost spiritual sense let me speak briefly then about this flaw in our educational ointment and its remedy and again we educators have had to be prodded by others to recognize that change was required we have been caught with our plans down i define the disadvantaged as those equal and fellow citizens for whom we must be concerned because they have reduced opportunities for social and economic success they comprise the social dynamite so dramatically portrayed by former harvard president james b conant the foremost challenge facing american education today in the north not just in the south is to equalize educa

poverty prejudice and the public library  of the same color class and creed integration can thus occur anywhere and of course in libraries libraries of all kinds have an essential role to play in putting those disadvantaged by poverty and prejudice on an equal footing with those who are more familiar with abundance and social success in a real sense libraries are probably the least segregated institutions but they can do more than they are now doing to achieve the kind of integration i am talking about an essential element in state and local planning for improved library service is the inclusion of innovative provisions for helping the disadvantaged to overcome their handicaps the improvement of reading ability and the instilment of the love of learning needs that represent ghastly failures in the functioning of the public schools are basic remedies for which libraries and their staffs are or ought to be well equipped in short i have often thought that public libraries should become more like schools and the elementary and secondary schools need to become more like libraries i know that in our own state with state and federal assistance we are trying to give the previous statement practical effect from the funds for operational grants in the library services and construction act lsca our state plan calls for almost  per cent of the total to be assigned to library systems for programs for the disadvantaged thus this project objective has the highest priority of seven objectives we have set for ourselves and the federal funds in title ii of the elementary and secondary education act along with state funds are making it possible to develop in the secondary and especially in the elementary schools not only decent library resources but also imaginative schemes for providing library services of all kinds including co operative programs with other institutions there is in the library liturgy what i shall call a myth in order to provoke you the myth is that a public library is a poor man university i have often heard the cliche and until a few years ago believed it like all myths it has some basis but myths once believed in become a basis for action and attitude and lead to an arteriosclerosis of belief thus limiting change and innovation if my claim seems to be outrageous let us look at new york for a moment we have just concluded an exhaustive and exhausting three year evaluation of our public library system we have  public libraries almost all of which are organized into  public library systems covering just about the whole state here are some excerpts from the report taken verbatim from two different summaries of it  the greatest intensity of library use was among college graduates  the low intensity of use among those persons over twenty five years of age with less than a high school education suggests the possibility that the library programs are not well designed to attract persons with a limited education  intensity of use dropped off rapidly as distance increased and very few libraries other than strong central libraries drew more than  per cent of their users from more than  miles  the study notes the need for vastly more study and experimentation
 the library quarterly in reaching a broader segment of the population in new york city particularly the great numbers of disadvantaged persons who live there  the study points up the overwhelming volume of student use of public libraries and the growing realization that the public library is the only library agency which is charged with the responsibility for service to all members of the community  the middle and upper classes are the users of the libraries this was suspected in some quarters but the study brought the fact sharply into focus further study will be needed to ascertain why because it is not sufficient to accept the notion that those who can read won read the libraries may have to retool their offerings so that the educationally deprived will find something of interest  improved facilities on accessible sites represent a primary goal libraries are undergoing renovation and modernization the truth of the matter is that many of them were built before the turn of the century many exist in decaying parts of large cities surrounded by industrial projects they have lived their life of usefulness the new facilities should be located on sites which are readily accessible by transportation and should be designed to operate in a society which is rapidly moving toward the turn of another century  library service of systems colleges and schools should be maximally intermeshed historically the development of these various institutions has brought different modes of operation i have thrown in this last finding simply because i do not believe the solution can be found to our library problems including services to the disadvantaged unless there is increased communication and co operation between all kinds of library agencies i know in our own state that the attitude between the different specialized segments of the library community has been something like the one of the pompous church of england cleric who said to his non conformist colleague one day we are both doing god work you in your way and i in his so far i have reviewed with you four trends interlocking complexity urbanization the mounting national interest in library affairs and racial integration i have also put research evidence behind the claim that public libraries serve only a relatively small fraction of the population and hardly any of those who are disadvantaged now i should like to turn at last to some special service programs being operated in new york i shall mention only three or four examples of the several being operated throughout the state in order to bring out the new concepts involved relating to personnel methods materials facilities programs and co operative action i am well aware of course of the many distinguished programs started in other urban areas of the country i am familiar with them only because i have read about them administrators of public libraries in the major cities of new york state knew that their services were being used very little by the poor the illiterate and those disadvantaged by prejudice there were language barriers educational deficiencies and limited mobility to name a few deterrents most of these libraries have now set up special programs in an attempt to reach the disadvantaged the brooklyn public library established a position in  called community coordinator to
