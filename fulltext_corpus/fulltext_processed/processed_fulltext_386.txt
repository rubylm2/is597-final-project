the adolescent in school robert d hess a dolescence as we know it in the united states is virtually unknown in most societies throughout the world although there are rumblings that come from observers reports and the news services that the turbulence we associate with teen age culture in the united states is spreading into urbanized industrial sections of europe south africa japan and australia this country still offers the most obvious demonstration of adolescent storm and stress however it is not the exhibition of crisis and conflict alone that gives american youth culture its unusual features as a subculture as a period of personal experience and as a defined phase of psychosocial development it contrasts with adolescence in other parts of the world i wish to consider first the place of adolescence as a part of american society second the central conflicts and crises of adolescents as individuals and third the meaning of the highschool experience for the teen ager perhaps the most prominent and significant feature of adolescence in this country is the fact that it has become such a visible and dramatic part of the social system the impact of youth culture upon adults comes in part from the vigor of teen agers and in part from the strength of numbers teen agers number approximately seventeen million a figure that will swell to twenty four million within the next half dozen years this is a group not only vocal as individuals but one that has public representatives speaking for it through magazines motion pictures television recordings and newspapers in dealing with teen agers adults are puzzled and uncertain on the one hand we devalue and even depreciate teen agers we dramatize and exploit their aberrations in the daily press the monthly magazine the theater and television we examine their problems in public conferences and in newspaper columns we scream of their crimes in our morning headlines but as a society we have not provided a place of respect and usefulness for them which can challenge their imagination and abilities the teen agers respond to both our condemnation and our confusion they believe themselves underrated mistrusted and assigned to an inferior status in a study which irene goldblatt and i conducted a few years ago we discovered that both teen agers and their parents held false and distorted ideas about each other adults felt that adolescents were likely to overrate themselves and to overestimate their maturity teen agers actually on the research instruments we used rated themselves in close agreement to the ratings they received from adults however they indicated that they expected adults to underrate teen agers grossly as a group and to minimize their maturity and sense of responsibility  robert d hess and irene goldblatt the status of adolescents in american society a problem in social identity child development vol xxviii no  december  these data come from parent child pairs of adults and teenagers for a more detailed account of the significance of the images family members hold of one 
 the library quarterly there has been in this country an increasing tendency to prolong the period of adolescence that is the length of time between puberty and the beginning of productive or at least adult roles in society the initial signs and symbols of physical and social maturity appear with some frequency at the elementaryschool level the pre adolescent often seems prematurely sophisticated and eager for adolescent heterosexual behavior at the other extreme we have acted to delay the time the teen ager can enter the labor market this is accomplished both by legislation controlling the age at which an adolescent may accept employment and by the demands of an industrial society for highly trained technical workers and for post high school education for various reasons the decrease of gainful employment in the united states has been apparent since the early part of the century as late as  almost  per cent of boys sixteen and seventeen years of age were employed by  only half that number held jobs the proportion had risen to  per cent in  reflecting an expanding labor market the decrease is more marked for adolescents under age sixteen and less so for those older however even in  the proportion of employed was much smaller in this country than in countries such as italy france and england where by age sixteen approximately  per cent of boys were gainfully employed the apparent rise in high school and college marriages suggests that adolescents in their late teens are resisting this prolonging of pre adult status this seems to me to be an inevitable consequence of the lengthening of the teenage period if the teen ager is urged toward maturity at an early age we can scarcely be surprised if he refuses to remain docile and childish but occasionally grasps the prerogatives of adults before the adult world is willing to extend them the relatively long period of adolescence is complicated by a second feature the ease of physical mobility both in freedom to range far and with relative frequence and in access to means of transportation the implication of this feature lies in its possibilities for extending the world of experience and in the ability to escape the supervision of adults this relative freedom offers the adolescent more opportunities for making his own decisions on a wide variety of social and sexual matters this is not to suggest that these decisions are necessarily unwise it does suggest however that teen agers have opportunity to assume responsibility over significant and potentially crucial aspects of their personal lives not only do teen agers have freedom of action but they also have at their command economic resources of remarkable scope and impact the teen age market is respected by industry clothes phonograph records books and moviesare but a few of the products which attract the billions of dollars which teenagers spend annually in the united states almost five million teen agers have part time jobs during the school year working after school hours and saturdays as clerks gardeners babysitters and extra help in markets servanother and of the teen ager in the family see robert d hess and gerald handel family worlds a psychosocial approach to family life chicago university of chicago press  chaps i iii and v ee r g kuhlen the psychology of adolescent development new york harper  bros  chap iv
the adolescent in school  ice stations and at home during the summer vacation twice as many are employed these are in addition to the three quarters of a million who have full time jobs it is difficult to calculate the total income of teen agers in this country but estimates place the figure at approximately nine billion dollars a year this is in addition to the money spent on them by their parents this economic power permits them to exercise a strong perhaps dominating influence over the popular record industry as we are painfully aware in the protracted contemporary reign of rock and roll these three circumstances a long adolescence relative freedom of movement and economic resources contribute to produce the most distinctive feature of adolescence in this country a teen age subculture somewhat apart from the main stream of society which in a number of significant respects sets its own code of behavior the trade mark of this subculture is its demand for differentiation from adult society and from the symbols of previous teenage groups the slang of the teen age group changes constantly so that the young adult is quickly out of touch with the peculiarities of verbal communication that he had so recently used to show that he was cool hep in the know or otherwise an up to date knowledgeable member of his group the lines of influence among teen agers are very strong as they attempt to keep pace with the crowd but they are by no means divorced from the values of the society or from the constraints exercised by adults a recent study by brittain indicates that in the crucial decisions regarding ethical moral and career choices they still tend to align themselves with the standards of adult society while in matters of lesser consequence they disdain the old fashioned manners and behaviors of their elders contrast this picture of american adolescence with that of an adolescent in italy described to me recently by a visiting professor from that country there in the typical instance the boy is expected to complete necessary schooling by his early teens after which he is apprenticed and expected to work full time childhood and adolescence as we know it both end abruptly and with little time for indulgence in the youth culture that he may occasionally see in american movies his energies are more controlled more directed by the society and his indoctrination into adult roles and behaviors comes relatively early in life how shall we evaluate the phenomenon of teen age culture in the united states it seems to me that a fair appraisal must view it not so much as a pattern of aberration on the part of our youth as a product of the complex society in which we live we have greatly increased the devices of mass communication in the last three decades and have made these generally available to adolescents providing them with a knowledge of the world and its problems and opportunities stimulating them to new and adult like experiences at the same time we have tended to give children and adolescents more freedom and have relaxed the strict moral codes of a halfcentury ago we have taken them off the labor market and delayed the time for a brief summary of the economic power and habits of teen agers see teen age consumers consumer reports xxii no  march     clay brittain parents and peers as competing influences in adolescence unpublished phd dissertation university of chicago 
 the library quarterly when they could assume the privileges of adults nevertheless we have tried to contain by social and moral sanctions the dynamic energy of youth although we have tried to place the blame for their mistakes on every available object the family the teen agers themselves television comic books the cold war the school the church we have yet to deal effectively with the problems that confront adolescents and through them ourselves a description of the social characteristics of the adolescent period only hints of the meaning which this phase of life holds for the individual teen ager although we may concern ourselves with the impact made by youth upon institutions such as the school the corporation or the church it is the influence youth culture has upon the individual boy or girl that must eventually command our attention there are many problems which face the adolescent as an inevitable part of the period of growth and development he has reached the obvious and natural fact of physical growth of changing physical dimensions and features of sexual maturation and of the uncertainty about the final results of this physical redevelopment are in themselves sources of anxiety or pride and often shame and tears we have made this aspect of the transition to adulthood particularly stressful by creating national standards of physical beauty that can be achieved by a disappointingly small proportion of our population coming to terms with physical resources that cannot be changed by diet cosmetics plastic surgery the gym reducing salon or hairdresser is certainly one of the important problems which the adolescent meets so must he also learn to make his way with his peers to be unafraid to stand up and be counted and to adopt a code which whether deliberately or not dictates his behavior these problems however are insignificant in comparison with the central problem of american youth a problem that we have largely created for ourselves and our children the task of finding and maintaining a sense of personal social identity the concept of personal identity and here i am drawing from erik erikson excellent definition and discussion is a condition of mental and emotional wellbeing which is represented in two areas first the individual person sense of continuity and stability in his definition of himself and second the recognition of this individual person identity and worth by the community of which he is a part identity implies individuality and reciprocal respect between the person and his peers it means being recognized rather than unknown and respected rather than ignored the opposite of identity is role diffusion the feeling of uncertainty about one place in the larger group or inability to commit one self to an occupation or to a lasting relationship to another person identity derives primarily from two sources sex role identification and commitment to an occupation or career both these areas of behavior define a man or woman place in the community determine many of the significant details of personal life and often dictate the cultural and social and economic levels in society in which they may be accepted the development of a sense of individuality and of self respect is founded upon these two central areas  erik erikson the problem of identity journal of the american psychoanalytic association iv january

 the library quarterly how much the adults around him may try to help the final commitments the subtle weaving together and integration of all the elements that make up his personality must be achieved by the teenager himself identity formation is a task of the ego and cannot be relinquished to an outside authority without serious threat to the autonomy of the individual person in an ideal situation the high school experience would afford the adolescent with opportunity to deal with both of the central strands of his identity crisis sex role and career commitment to a degree this is possible however several factors tend to emphasize his preoccupation with sex role behaviors dating social facility demonstrating masculinity or feminity etc during the high school period and de emphasize or postpone the problems of occupational or career choice thus striving for popularity interaction in social clubs and the like are prominent aspects of the high school non curricular life in moving away from the authority of parents and other adults and in experimenting with the behaviors which they consider to be more grown up they turn to each other for support for information and for rules of approved behavior they often relate to institutions as the church or school in these groups or cliques rather than as individuals at school church ymca as well as in informal leisure activities the cliques are the basic social units the clique establishes in part the rules for social behavior defining activities that are approved and those that are rejected while the influence of the clique or gang is strong it is probably less overwhelming than many parents fear one of the uses that the teen ager makes of the clique is illustrated by the views that teens and their parents displayed in a series of interviews conducted by one of our graduate students in the committee on human development when asked about the relative merits of single or double dating both teen agers and parents agreed that they preferred double dating to single dating for highschool students however they gave discrepant reasons for this preference the parents revealed an opinion that double dating tended to decrease the possibility of sexual activity on dates the teen agers seemed to be relatively unconcerned with this problem to them the advantage of double dating was much less dramatic as one girl expressed it when four people are along it a lot easier to keep the conversation going at least one of them can usually think of something to say thus the concern of the teen agers was with whether they could properly and adequately meet the demands of a social situation and they depended on one another for assistance this portrayal of the tensions of adolescence suggests that the high school period is a time of rapid and extensive learning much of it completely outside the scope of the high school curriculum in fact it may tend to reduce the interest and motivation for acquisition of academic knowledge this may occur not only because the school is competing with other interests but because the social clique or group may sometimes deliberately adopt a casual attitude toward intellectual activity one highschool senior that we interviewed expressed it in roughly these words the fellows in our high school are more or less divided into three clicks first there are those who like school clubs like the al school league who like to be school officers and stuff
the adolescent in school  like that second there my group those who fool around all the time the aces guys who belong to different boys clubs last are a bunch of little sissy boys the group who just comes to school to learn our group is more or less the most popular all of us are crazy guys kind of fun to get into my group you have to have a good sense of humor go out for some sport fool around in class get average grades know how to make out with the girls be sort of tough be able to take care of yourself and don chicken out of a fight the social clique may also reinforce standards of scholarship and intellectual interests in a high school where professor allison davis and i have conducted research we have found that the clique or social club often had a formal or informal expectation of its members with regard to behavior toward the school in many respects it tended to exhibit a characteristic way of reacting to the school authorities that varies from active co operation to planned programs for irritating and annoying teachers who for various reasons had attracted the dislike of the group such behavior was typically viewed by the teachers as the misconduct of an individual when in reality it was the expression of a group discipline against the individual member was usually ineffectual because of the reward and support the individual member received from the clique at the other extreme were cliques of students who prided themselves on tlheir intellectual ability and promoted tience clubs chess clubs and other mental endeavors the attitudes of such groups are indicated by the remark of one high school senior when asked if he intended to go to the prom his reply was why should i go to the prom with the money i would spend i could pay tuition for a semester at the state university the adolescent school experience and his behavior in the social club as well are strongly influenced by the social class environment from which he comes whether it is the shadow of the slums or the privileges of the wealthy exclusive estate the impact of social background intrudes upon the individual from his earliest moment it extends or limits his intellectual stimulation determining to a great extent the use that he will be able to make of his genetic resources when he becomes an adult the social background and the family through which its influence is exercised upon the young child molds the mental and to a degree the emotional faculties which the child brings to the schoolroom the lower class child comes to the classroom from a world which is geographically narrow and intellectually barren one of my students recently completed a case history of a lower class girl who had lived on the south side of chicago for almost ten years but who had never in that time visited the downtown area or seen lake michigan this is not an isolated example the intellectual deprivation suffered by a lower class child is almost impossible for the middle class adult to comprehend the preschool books and bedtime reading are virtually unknown the range of ideas and the concepts for directing his thinking are limited to practical concrete situations and the immediate problems of maintaining an existence in contrast the middle class child is urged toward intellectual experience and is taught to reason and to deal with words and concepts both verbal and printed he is rewarded for mental effort and interest his work at school receives careful and anxious supervision at home and he readily learns the im

the adolescent in school  the library from my position of relative ignorance about library science and the practical problems of library management i can borrow indulgence and comment freely the first thing that impresses me is the incompatability that exists between the image of the typical library and the image of the typical teen ager libraries in general are models of middle class orderliness docility restraint and courtesy the library card is a symbol of intellectuality of responsibility with a touch of civic interest thrown in teen agers present a picture of impulsiveness lack of order casual regard for responsibility and a notable lack of respect for adult restraint whatever the term square means to a teen ager i am sure he would often apply it to most people on both sides of the librarian desk i do not know what image the teen ager has of the library and the librarian and this is a point on which some useful research might be done but from what we know of the teenager attitudes toward adults and adult institutions it seems highly probable that it represents to him an extreme in adult restrictions and taboos on his typical modes of behavior in addition habitual and unnecessary trips to the library will rarely add to his status and acceptance among his peers in contrast to the library are other sources of reading material available to him i refer to the elaborate newsstands of urban areas and even of relatively small towns to the book sections of some museums i have seen and to the magazine sections df the local drugstores here he has relatively easy access a great deal of color and dramatic display a feeling of excitement and adventure in fantasy and little pressure for proper behavior and conformity to the regulations of an institution the library is geared to the behavior and manners of adults and well behaved children the newsstand the book section and the pocket book display are tolerant and inviting the library is designed in part to protect books the newsstand is designed to excite his imagination if we were to plan a library center with the teen ager and his youth culture in mind what might be the features of such a place i can imagine libraries or extensions of libraries reading and communication centers perhaps located near community recreational f acilities which would be designed for children and adolescents with the underlying purpose of attracting the teenager to the book or magazine and making them accessible to him with as little red tape and formality as possible one might consider a facility which would include in addition to a central area for reading materials motion pictures adventure sports current history natural history professional advice and many others records both popular and classical tape recordings video tapes and other permanent records of mass communication the philosophy of such a center would be to stimulate reading and the acquisition of information and vicarious experience across a range of mass communication from popular culture to the classics i believe that teen agers would respond  these remarks are intended to apply primarily to the voluntary use of public and school library facilities they may seem inappropriate to persons accustomed to dealing with college oriented middle class teen agers whose home experience has encouraged reading and intellectual activities they are particularly appropriate however to the situation that obtains for millions of adolescents from lower socioeconomic backgrounds
 the library quarterly with an enthusiasm that would astonish their elders and could incorporate such a center into their image of contemporary youth culture teen agers want to read and to experience the unknown and the familiar through fantasy provided by the array of devices at our disposal i scarcely need to add that reading and other fantasy experience can be a means for the teen ager to learn both about himself and the outside world and so can assist him in the effort to meet successfully the crises of his chronological age and the historical era into which he was born we cannot obscure the fact that he is headed into a complex and often contradictory adult world we do him no favor by shielding him from the realities he is about to meet it is more communication about people about the society and about the world that he needs the adult world and the library as a central institution of communication can help him in his search for a sound productive and creative social and personal role in the community
