technological foundations for bibliographic control systems ronald l wigington and charles n costakos introduction a wide range of information technology has been available for several years from which to build information handling systems for bibliographic control that technology continuing to outrun the ability of designers to build complex systems and administrators to agree on the institutional aspects of running them has been improving rapidly both in performance and cost the improvements in information technology show every sign of continuing and they will provide those institutions which have had the foresight to commit themselves to use those technologies with a distinct advantage in the struggles for survival of our library and information institutions particularly beneficial have been cooperative ventures made possible by those technologies where shared work reduces the redundant activities in each institution or at least provides a shared facility for use by several institutions this report will review recent progress current status and continuing trends in the availability and use of information technology in building systems for bibliographic control although we are mainly interested in looking ahead to what can be done a comparison of today position with the expectations of five to six years ago will provide additional insight into the rate of progress in developing information technology we must also understand that we are dealing with only a brief instant of time in a very long evolution while we are concerned with continuity of the growth of knowledge since antiquity we are also concerned with the continuity of today knowledge into the twenty first century by now the reality and inevitability of the use of highly developed technology in library and information systems should be a foregone conclusion our strategy should be to design and operate systems for continuity and not be trapped into optimizing for the immediate future technology assessment five years ago in  and  an assessment by a panel of the national academy of sciences sponsored by the council on library resources was made of the library quarterly vol  no  pp    by the university of chicago all right reserved 
 ronald l wigington and charles n costakos state of computer and related technologies for application to libraries and information systems the results were published in  in the report libraries and information technology a national system challenge  at that time the long promised payoffs through the use of various automation technologies in library operations and services and in the information industry in general had not yet occurred moreover not enough practical experience on a significant operational scale had been demonstrated to support the promises large systems had been slow and expensive in development and had fewer capabilities than desired there were questions as to the shortcomings in the technology that had prevented faster progress this study found that the trend of technological development showed every sign of being able to produce the necessary nuts and bolts from which to put together large scale computer based information systems of national extent not only was the basic technological feasibility assured but the cost trends of specific equipment were favorable while there were problems in   in bringing complex systems into reality these were attributed to institutional defense mechanisms organizational problems and the tremendously difficult task of managing the development and introduction of complex systems the computer applications industry was poorly prepared for the task lacking a stable and effective body of doctrine and practice to guide work on such systems regardless of whether they were bibliographic business banking or other systems at the same time the intellectual boundaries between the bibliographic disciplines and those involved in the production and application of technology were difficult to bridge the nature and context of bibliographic control systems guidance in the design of large scale information systems and especially in the representation and structuring of the information they contain may be had from a comparison of computation systems and information systems both of which are implemented with the same basic technology as pointed out by endicott and huyck computation systems can be thought of in relation to information systems in the following way a computation system has data to be found in the future embedded in its logic prepared in the past an information system has logic to be found in the future embedded in its data prepared in the past  p  if not understood this fundamental difference in approach can lead to a failure to understand what the important requirements are for information systems especially the requirement for flexibility to extend the system for use outside the local and current context for which it was originally constructed information representation and file design thus take on an importance that extends beyond their relationship to the specific processes which had operat
technological foundations  ed on them at the time the system had been installed there will be new processes not known at the time of installation which will be introduced and used on data recorded in the past conversion and upgrading of files for new purposes may not be economically feasible if the original designs for the files were too limiting and did not provide for the recording of essential detail and for authority control a fundamental problem of storing information for future use is finding practical compromises between current economy and future value a value which cannot fully be quantified fortunately with the rapid improvements of information technology the cost of information storage and computer processing is decreasing while the human effort necessary for information analysis and data entry is becoming more expensive the benefit of an increasing level of mechanization is increasing while this conference is focused on library systems for bibliographic control we must also be aware of how the systems relate to a national scale information system involving public and private institutions the general functions of a national scale information system include selection processes for choosing what should be obtained and stored storage processes for appropriately organizing the information to be stored for storing the information and for maintaining and managing the storehouses access processes for identifying and finding desired information in the storehouse distribution processes for transferring information from producer to storehouse among storehouses and from storehouses to users control processes for orchestrating the selection storage access and distribution functions  p  bibliographic data are used throughout all of these functions and the processes of bibliographic control require essentially the same technology as the total information system moreover since aspects of bibliographic control extend well beyond the boundaries of the library community into the publishing abstracting and indexing and user environments the needs and influences of these other environments and institutions must not be neglected thus as we examine the technological foundations for bibliographic control we encounter all facets of information technology also although the total volume of bibliographic data to be processed exchanged and used nationally and internationally is very large it is only a fraction of the size of the total body of information to which it refers often applications of new technology for information handling first become economically practical on the smaller volume of data thus in the systems we build today for bibliographic control we will see precursors of methods for handling primary information in the future this in turn needs to be taken into account in designing systems for bibliographic control
 ronald l wigington and charles n costakos aspects of information technology the general term information technology has been used to cover a variety of electronic and photographic digital and image handling technologies that are being applied to all phases of information handling from original generation through use chief among these technologies is computer technology which has received widespread attention for many years the computer hardware for information processing and storage and the software that makes it work are central in modern information technology because effective computer based information systems are not limited to transformation storage and retrieval functions but also include the mechanism for control of all other technologically based components of the information system because such a large fraction of the total human effort required in today computer based information systems occurs at the information input stage data entry technology is singled out for special review in this discussion data entry technology includes many kinds of keyboarding equipment and terminals as well as ocr equipment bar code reading equipment and so called word processing systems the second aspect of these systems is communication technology which is intimately involved in any terminal oriented system and which provides a linkage mechanism for geographically dispersed networks a third aspect of the technology is reprography this includes methods for production not only of printed pages but also of microforms and other image replication it also includes distribution media and means for the use of nonconventional media progress status and trends comparing the status and trends of now  with those of five to six years ago we see that the optimism expressed in the expectations in   has been well supported in most instances in the development of the basic technology and in the increasingly successful application of it computers there have been two divergent trends in the development of the technology of central processing units one is represented by the very fast supercomputers which execute hundreds of millions of instructions per second through pipeline designs that perform many computations in parallel such examples as the cdc star sdc pepe and cray  have been under development for a long time and are now emerging for use on very large scale computational problems  the second trend is toward much cheaper and more capable minicomputers that can be used for decentralized computa
technological foundations  tional functions and microcomputers that allow even further distribution of control and interaction functions into intelligent terminals and other peripheral equipment both development trends were established about fifteen years ago but the economic and performance improvements of large scale integrated lsi circuits have been dramatic over the past few years as was expected and have made it possible to bring those ideas to fruition in addition the widespread emergence of low cost lsi solid state digital electronics in the telecommunications and office equipment market and in the general consumer market for entertainment appliance controls automotive controls calculators and watches will keep a strong downward pressure on prices for an increasing level of electronic capability   the increasing quantity of production and the competition for those markets should be very beneficial for the buyer increase in market volume always has a beneficial effect on unit prices as long as shortages of supply can be avoided the industry annual volume for minicomputers hardware service and software has grown from well under  billion in  to approximately  billion in  and an increase to  billion is expected in   supercomputers might be applicable and attractive for very large information processing centers if parallel processing strategies similar to those applied to large scale array computations could be used however the trends of much more importance for bibliographic control systems arise from miniand microcomputer developments although there are software costs that potentially far exceed hardware costs and no less care must be taken in total system design the basic hardware is getting so inexpensive that one barrier to system acquisition is almost gone it was predicted in  that by  a k word computer of respectable performance would be available for incorporation into intelligent terminals and would cost between  and  currently the price of sixteen bit minicomputers with k words k bytes of memory starts at about  for use in intelligent terminals and other controllers microcomputers range from a few hundred dollars up to  depending upon the amount of memory and other features for example a popular microcomputer with k bytes of memory forty eight inputoutput lines and other necessary interfacing and control circuitry costs about  a basic minicomputer system of medium computational capacity including k bytes of memory two disk cartridges of m bytes each a real time clock and a teletype class terminal can be purchased for around  a key factor in making these minicomputers effective for information systems is the low cost high performance semiconductor memory that in  typically costs around  per bit for  k bytes as compared with   per bit in  the availability of cheap memory to hold the large volume of text and data structures which characterize these applications has particularly aided nonnumeric information processing and interactive systems
 ronald l wigington and charles n costakos for computer systems employing virtual memory techniques to extend the effective size of real memory the paging medium and the page rate it can support are extremely important   they were important five years ago but the increasing spread of virtual memory machines has increased that importance paging media are still drums or with somewhat lesser performance standard disks there has long been an access gap in capacity and speed between these rotating media and the primary memory of computers three technologies are striving to close that gap beamos beam addressed metal oxide semiconductor memory ccd charge coupled devices and magnetic bubbles utilization of all are claimed to be imminent   system designers may find that these secondary memory devices further improve the priceperformance of both large scale and small computers although the same improvements may also come directly from the continued improvement of the priceperformance of solid state primary random access memory  by any measure one wishes to examine the computational power available for information systems has become very much cheaper in the last five or six years and is no longer a major obstacle to system development direct access memory more important for information systems than computational power is secondary direct access storage now available in various fixed and demountable forms the priceperformance improvement in this field over the last several years has also been remarkable the hardware capital cost of disk memory including disk controller has already improved since  by the factor of ten which had been predicted to occur by    p  and now costs less than   per bit typical examples of disk memory unit costs are  for large central systems for example ibm   x  byte fixed media installation  x  bit  for medium scale minicomputers for example pdp  x  byte demountable media installation  x bit these improvements have come about by increasing the storage density on magnetic media and from high volume competitive marketing as demonstrated in the moderate capacity ibm winchester and memorex data mark there is another factor of five or six in density of storage on rotational magnetic media that may become available in larger units  p  this does however appear to approach the limits of material and mechanical tolerances in addition to limits on growth of capacity due to physical limits there are practical limits to the effectiveness of very large capacity disks because so much information is reachable only through a single reading arm on each unit high volume random access traffic will be impeded by such bottlenecks and the ability to store a quantity of information becomes less important than the ability to access it careful balancing of the placement of the
technological foundations  information in a multi unit assembly may be needed typically and fortunately bibliographic files have very skewed access patterns a small fraction of the material being accessed most of the time this high activity portion can be placed to minimize access conflicts by using file access software that allows physical placement optimization these recent advances in disk technology have brought file storage capacities up to sizes that are suitable for large on line bibliographic systems at hardware costs that are now acceptable but still continuing to drop this cost drop however should be expected to level off as the limits of mechanical tolerances are reached the availability of large disk units for minicomputer systems at costs per bit much less than units formerly available only for medium to large computers is particularly important for information systems mass storage large scale mass memory with storage capacities of  bits and more has not advanced as rapidly to the level of performance expected or to that needed for very large information systems the major advances in high density disk systems have satisfied the needs of users of moderate sized data bases but the demand for very large installations has not been very strong highdensity magnetic tapes are still the major medium for truly large files of multibillion byte size and larger some major on line systems have multibillion byte storage capacities implemented with disks and a few are still operating with data cells the two mass storage units most likely to be routinely used the ibm  and the cdc  are essentially magnetic tape media segmented for mechanical handling the storage cost is of the order of  per bit which is the same as the cost of large scale storage five years ago the basic mechanical segmentation into cells moves data from storage position to readwrite station in several seconds in quantities of  million bytes cdc or  million bytes ibm because of the way in which the data are divided into cells which are mechanically moved such units are well suited to the automation of tape libraries containing many small files which are fetched loaded and then accessed as disk files the file sizes handled best are those within an order of magnitude of the basic physical segmentation however because of mechanical queuing delays such devices are not well suited for very large multibillion byte files which have frequent and widely dispersed random access nor are they suited for very large serial files which are better handled by high speed high density magnetic tape a mix of highcapacity disks and a mass storage unit may be useful for the mix of active and relatively inactive portions of very large files such as will be found in a large bibliographic system the promises of massive cheap rapid access storage using holography or other novel technologies have not yet been fulfilled and system designers must design around the limits of access dynamics now imposed by the mechanical
 ronald l wigington and charles n costakos handling of segmented high density media progress since the introduction of the ibm photostore in mid s has not been impressive  other approaches such as using large numbers of multiple disk assemblies for example the stc  an  million byte assembly for the relatively inactive portion of local files will become competitive with the low end of the size range for mass storage units the video disk now being considered for home playback of television programs and movies  is one version of the new media receiving recent attention that have potential application for digital mass storage one of these for example called discovision stores  tv frames on one side of a twelve inch circular surface and uses a laser readout technique  even in this image handling form such a medium may be useful in a library environment for storage and use of large compilations of catalogs indexes and reference materials that now require many feet of shelf space formatting of the material to be stored consistent with the image resolution of standard tv equipment would be required success of the technology in the entertainment market will improve the economics of its use for other purposes adaptation for digital storage and use for low cost read only digital information distribution is likely and depending upon the amount of redundancy encoding necessary to combat bit errors due to various reasons a potential exists for storing tens of billions of bits on each twelve inch disk playback system cost is expected to be low and thus this storage medium could be very useful in minicomputer based systems for implementation of massive stores of information however mechanical handling of media or the simultaneous use of many playback units would be required terminals and data entry recent advances in semiconductor technology along with related trends toward geographically distributed use of computer systems have fostered a proliferation of terminals for data entry and data communications estimates by arthur d little inc  indicate that total annual sales of all types of terminals including the special purpose terminals for banks and point of sale applications will more than double from  to  to a total value of  billion the number of installed terminals of all types will increase from  worth  billion to  worth  billion during this period the percentage of total computing hardware expenditures allocated to terminals will also increase from  percent in  to about  percent by  a much wider range of capabilities has become available in terrninals over the past few years and the trend toward increased capabilities along with slowly declining prices is expected to continue growth for these more powerful terminals those with more functional capabilities will be much stronger during the next five to ten years than that for the simpler keyboard printer terminals which had become so widespread by the early s the market
technological foundations  for these simpler text terminals those compatible with the teletype model  will decline slowly over the next five years becoming essentially a replacement market aggressive marketing by teletype of its more powerful model  terminal should assure growth in the market for teletype compatible asynchronous text terminals substantial growth is also forecast for the ibm  compatible synchronous display terminals the largest growth is anticipated for crt text terminals with some hard copy attachments becoming more readily available what the growth for graphics terminals will be is still uncertain at this point as it has been for many years the market for the less expensive and more powerful storage tube graphics terminals like the tektronix  and the hughes conographic series will expand quickly relative to a small installed base and will continue to be used to fill special system requirements wide general use does not however seem likely very soon although the cost of these terminals has declined substantially in recent years they are still in the  range and in some cases higher the introduction of the so called intelligent terminals those with memoryand microprocessor based computing functions available at the terminal itself provides new opportunities for distributing to the terminal some of those tasks which have normally been handled by the main computer or minicomputer in on line systems this aids the development of larger more responsive on line interactive systems an example of this type of terminal is the recently introduced beehive  this terminal has k bytes of display memory and supports scrolling of up to  display lines it is user programmable with up to k bytes of random access memory available the contents of this memory can be loaded from the computer to which the terminal is attached so that multiple applications can be handled by the same terminal hardware configuration standard functions include the ability to display up to  different custom specified characters and to insert or delete characters from the text displayed on the screen it can be programmed to interact in complex ways with the operator and to insert or delete words sentences and paragraphs the terminal can operate asynchronously at  bits per second or synchronously at  bits per second it is all the more remarkable because its base purchase price is in the  range which makes it very attractive indeed for large on line systems where large amounts of text are processed at the terminal and where responsiveness is important many more terminals of this type can be expected to enter the market the prospects for success in using such terminals lie in synthesizing the appropriate design for the application system that is in an appropriate selection of functions to be performed and the distribution of those functions among the main computer the terminal and the minicomputer which may support those terminals for data entry applications the use of keyboard clusters a group of full display or limited display terminals controlled by a single shared minicomputer has spread rapidly and will continue to do so for the next few years as
 ronald l wigington and charles n costakos users continue to replace the keypunch paper tape and key to tape devices with these systems the keyboard clusters are competitive in pricethroughput with the more conventional stand alone data entry machines and provide clear advantages in data editing reformatting and system management and control the future for optical character recognition ocr equipment as an important alternative for data entry has been somewhat uncertain in spite of occasional glowing predictions to the contrary recent surveys  indicate that the large majority of users who are planning to change data entry equipment will change to keyboard clusters only a few plan to switch to ocr the reasons that this industry has so far failed to fulfill its earlier promise include high equipment cost continuing high error rates limited font recognition capability forms design problems document positioning and transport difficulties and inadequate handprint reading capability specialized system requirements like turnaround documents are being and will continue to be met by ocr devices but use for general text input will probably grow only very slowly and be dwarfed by expanded use of keyboard clusters it is risky to predict the impact of improving costperformance of semiconductor technology on ocr equipment many of the key components are electronic scanners recognition units and controllers and there is increasing use of software instead of hardware to implement more complex capabilities in these functions these developments have recently led to improved prospects for highly sophisticated ocr systems which can read multiple fonts intermixed on a page the information international grafix i a multimillion dollar system reads characters on microfilm which minimizes document positioning and transport problems it has already been used by the us navy to republish over a million pages of technical manuals containing text illustrations and tables  and to convert some canadian court records to digital form  a much less expensive multifont system which might be expected to be in the  thousand range is now being introduced by kurzweil computer products inc  the kurzweil machine was originally conceived as a method of converting ordinary printed information in a wide variety of character fonts to synthesized speech for the use of the blind the character recognition portion of it implemented through software for feature analysis should provide the basis for a conversion system that is significantly more economical than normal keyboarding these products illustrate the availability of reasonable solutions to special system problems and offer hope for a practical solution to the general print reading problem that has been elusive in previous years  a turnaround document is a medium sent to a customer it can be in such forms as punched cards ocr cards or magnetically readable symbols and it is returned to the processing center to be read at least in part mechanically turnaround documents are used in many billing systems
technological foundations  one class of optical reading devices for data input which is gaining wide acceptance is the bar code reader  from a beginning usually traced to labeling of railroad cars for control and inventory functions in large rail yards bar codes have become very widespread particularly in the last few years with the adoption of bar coding for the universal product code a large market for bar code labelers and readers is virtually assured  the availability of relatively inexpensive and reliable equipment has led to the adoption of bar codes for an incredible variety of data entry applications includirng library circulation and control systems a few such systems are available commercially for libraries and a number of systems based on bar codes are in operation or nearing completion in libraries now including the university of chicago library for monitoring and controlling the movement of physical objects identification techniques based on bar codes offer an attractive solution word processing systems in part provide yet another alternative for data entry sometimes called source data automation referring to the recording of data in machine readable form at its source this eliminates the need to type manually or write the data for later transcription to machine readable form it seems clear that the labor intensive office the last big holdout to automation in businesses will soon fall to revolutionary new informationprocessing systems based on advances in the technologies covered in this paper  it is not clear how soon is soon some feel that by  most handling of business records and correspondence will be electronic but this is one of the more optimistic predictions there were an estimated  editing typewriters installed at the end of  and this number is expected to triple within the next five years a related development is the possibility that electronic mail handling systems will become available through the us postal service a recent study  for the us postal service confirms that current technology is adequate to develop such a system within ten years if the appropriately careful systems design were done these trends presage the growth of a broad market for this new class of electronic data entry equipment this will have an impact on library systems through the availability of lower priced system components and by the appearance of some computer readable primary documents the requirement for use of large character sets including nonroman and special characters has been a continuing problem in bibliographic control systems as well as for publishers and abstracting and indexing services with the advent of display terminals and nonimpact printers which use dot matrixes to form a wide range of different characters this problem is now tractable the beehive  intelligent terminal for example can display up to  different characters and nonimpact printers driven by appropriate formatting programs are routinely used to compose text with several hundred different characters the adoption by the american national standards institute and the international organization for standardization iso of a standard
 ronald l wigington and charles n costakos basic character set called ascii in the united states along with standard mechanisms for extending this scheme to represent virtually any number of additional characters makes possible the representation and exchange of bibliographic information using as many different characters as needed communications by almost any measuring scale the data communications industry is large and growing rapidly most data communications systems extant today use voice grade telephone lines typically at transmission rates up to  kilobits per second although rates up to  kilobits per second are now available the higher transmission speeds  kilobits per second and higher are becoming somewhat more available but they require special communication channel arrangements and are still relatively expensive communications costs have been declining and are expected to continue declining but at a slow rate  the so called value added networks vans like telenet and tymnet along with other specialized common carriers made possible by a  fcc ruling have made long distance communication charges more nearly proportional to actual use  this has helped make possible the rapidly growing use of on line retrieval services such as those operated by lockheed information systems and systems development corporation and this in turn has spurred the building of a growing number of bibliographic data bases by abstracting and indexing services for computer searching for the novice or infrequent user there are difficulties in learning the query language and indexing schemes implemented by the providers of search service and in understanding the widely differing structure and content of the many data bases now available a number of technological innovations are under development which hold promise for continued lower data communication costs and improved service alternatives optical fibers through which data can be transmitted by light pulses are being tested in telephone circuits by the bell system and others  they offer the advantage of being much smaller and lighter than traditional copper cables as well as eliminating interference with adjacent lines because of the induction properties of conventional circuits because of their transmission characteristics they offer a wider bandwidth than conventional telephone circuits and thus will permit faster data communications over the standard voice grade channels  american telephone and telegraph is also gradually shifting to digital transmission and switching equipment  for a description of these standards see the following american national standards x code for information interchange x  code extension techniques for use with the  bit coded character set of american national standard code for information interchange ascii x the corresponding international standards published by the international organization for standardization iso are iso   and iso   respectively
technological foundations  which will provide faster more accurate and less expensive means for data communications than the existing analog circuits the use of satellites for data communications offers more accurate and cheaper long haul communications especially for overseas hookups  a number of communications satellites are already in use  the cost for the ground stations necessary for satellite data communications is still high around  or higher but is expected to decline to about  within five years  the extremely wide bandwidth of cable television along with its potential of being connected to every individual home have long held the promise of providing a low cost means for data communications for homes and businesses but cable television has yet to fulfill this promise partly because of the enormous investment required and partly because demand for it has been disappointingly low especially in the cities where normal tv reception is of good quality its actual degree of use for data communications in the future remains a question at this point a significant trend is the gradual blurring of functions between computers and data communications the use of computers to regulate and direct data flow in value added networks has helped reduce communication costs as noted above the increasing use of microprocessors to handle communications functions in terminals front end processors data concentrators and satellites are all signals of this blurring of function and thus of the merging of these two once separate industries reprography while technological innovations have revolutionized the computer industry as a whole improvements in impact printers have been only evolutionary in scope improvements will continue to be made but printing has become an increasing bottleneck as computing speed has increased advances in nonimpact printers within the last decade have provided a good alternative  nonimpact printers can be much faster than impact printers because they are not limited by the operation of electromechanical hammers although paper movement mechanisms can be a problem the nonimpact printing technologies with the most promise at this point are ink jet systems on one hand and electrophotographic and electrostatic systems on the other  a number of systems utilizing these technologies are commercially available and work well although some problems of reliability have been encountered with ink jet systems and the cost of paper for electrophotographic and electrostatic systems is still relatively high among the electrophotographic printers the laser printers introduced within the last few years are particularly promising including such systems as the xerox  the ibm  and the canon lbp   in addition to their high speed these nonimpact printers offer a much wider range of functional capabilities than impact printers including an essentially unlimited character set and the ability to compose intermixed text and graphics although the market for impact
 ronald l wigington and charles n costakos printers is far from dead use of nonimpact printers is expected to grow rapidly according to a recent report by frost and sullivan inc of new york  the market share for nonimpact printers will increase from  percent of the total printer market in  to  percent by  in the last fifteen to twenty years the text composition industry has changed drastically as a result of the introduction of computer based techniques for page composition the use of computer driven photocomposition machines is widespread and has provided significant economies for printing with no degradation in quality more recent developments in hardware and in software support make possible the automatic composition of intermixed text and graphics on a page these machines are generally cathode ray tube phototypesetters although some laser beam and fiber optics devices are being built the output of these systems is a photographic image of the page which is then transferred to a plate for printing the major function in the composition industry which is still largely unautomated is the task of creating the printing plate itself for most printing companies the composed pages must be manually arranged on a multipage flat and this flat is then used to create a multipage printing plate for the printing presses this process is time consuming expensive and error prone the purpose of a new generation of platemakers is to eliminate this series of steps development of two types of such automated platemakers microformto plate and laser devices is receiving particular emphasis the microformto plate machines use microfilm images of the pages as input automatically arrange these images in the proper sequence and orientation and enlarge the images for burning a plate the laser devices scan composed pages with a low wattage laser beam and use that beam to control the movements of a separate high powered laser which burns the printing plate directly since two separate lasers are involved they need not necessarily be located at the same site some of these machines have been set up with the two lasers widely separated in distance linked together via data communications facilities laser platemakers are almost exclusively used by newspaper publishers at this time because their high volume justifies the high equipment costs both microform and laser technologies offer significant cost advantages for highvolume publishers and the equipment cost will decline as sales increase the predictions for growth of the microforms industry have consistently been much higher than actual growth and growth forecasts are now much more conservative and probably more realistic than in past years  the expanded use of microforms is still limited by their many well known disadvantages which include too many formats reduction ratios and retrieval coding schemes poor quality film images at the reader and on hard copy prints readers which are expensive hard to use and bulky inadequate user environments in libraries and difficulty in obtaining hard copy prints as bagg  points out these are the same disadvantages that have plagued microforms for many years and libraries alone cannot afford to fund the
technological foundations  developments needed to overcome these problems they must be able to take advantage of developments generated by demand from a much larger market for large files that are characterized by primarily serial access roll microfilm will continue to be an effective storage medium for smaller amounts of information like technical reports and even full journals microfiche is a more hospitable medium and is being increasingly used in spite of the continuing lack of standard formats and reduction ratios which is more of a problem for fiche than roll film the use of fiche will probably continue to grow although slowly the rising cost of silver halide films which is the only type suitable at this point for archival storage makes broad growth based on these films unlikely the newer vesicular and diazo films are lower in cost and perfectly acceptable for many uses but there has not as yet been sufficient testing to guarantee their use for archival storage increased use of these films for document storage in libraries is thus retarded  the introduction of ultrafiche which is essentially microfiche prepared with high reduction ratios in the x to x range has further confounded the problems with microforms much of the development of ultrafiche has been outside the mainstream of micrographics since it typically uses nontraditional technologies for part of the processing the formats and reduction ratios employed vary even more widely for ultrafiche than microfiche and they show no signs of converging on even a few standards the use of ultrafiche has primarily been to fulfill special system requirements such as credit card verification bank signature card verification large catalogs of industrial parts and telephone directory assistance lookups these are likely to continue to be the primary areas of future use the special library collections which have been distributed on ultrafiche like the encyclopaedia britannica libraty of american civilization are expensive and have not been marketing successes  aside from their importance to libraries for document collections microforms are finding more frequent applications for internal library processes as well the development of computer output microfilm com has provided a very convenient way to generate some large internal library files on roll microfilm or on microfiche from a computer based master file files such as card catalogs and union lists are being found more frequently on comproduced microforms because frequently updated files such as these can be maintained by a computer system and periodically regenerated in their entirety for use by library patrons and librarians as libraries move to more computer based techniques for internal processing and control the use of com files to replace conventional paper and card files will increase according to a recent report on the microfilm industry by frost and sullivan the future of the microfilm industry will depend largely on how well com computer output microfilm penetrates the marketplace  the com proportion of the total microfilm industry will reach  percent by
 ronald l wigington and charles n costakos  according to the report there are now an estimated  to  com installations worldwide at an average cost of  per installation and the market is expected to grow at  to  percent per year  advances in computer technology have provided increased flexibility in com devices for varied formats and reduction ratios and for improved control while the microfilm industry and especially the com related segment is expected to continue growing microfilm has become less attractive for storage of large dynamic files because the cost of electronic storage media continues to plummet a glimmer of hope for the use of microfilm for certain kinds of dynamic files is represented by the development of updatable microfilm systems three companies have recently introduced updatable microfilm systems m will market the microvonic file developed by energy conversion devices inc a b dick and scott graphics inc have formed a joint venture called a b dickscott to develop and market a system and general electric and bell and howell have formed a company called microx corporation to develop and market yet a third system at least two other companies xerox corporation and eastman kodak corporation are also experimenting with these techniques  rather than actually changing images on the microfiche these systems permit the later addition of new images to the same microfiche in frames left blank when the fiche was first exposed a b dickscott has already sold several machines to the us army for the creation and maintenance of personnel records  the technology looks promising but it is too early yet to predict its success for widespread implementation in addition to its possible use for digital storage videodisk can be used for storage and retrieval of documents in image form the resolution of videodisk images will not be adequate for displaying a full normal sized printed page on one frame because of the limitations of standard tv circuitry but portions of a page could be displayed with acceptable quality the spread of this technology for document image distribution depends completely on the success of videodisks in the home entertainment market since their success there would lower costs by providing a large volume market software as the hardware components of information systems become cheaper and a wider variety becomes available and as system complexity increases to serve a wider range of functions the software component becomes more important the software component of computer systems has become the dominant cost factor in system construction one fairly recent estimate  is that software will be  percent of the total system development costs by  this cost is exceeded only by the much larger expense of information analysis and data entry for building the files of a large scale information system in the past there have been four factors included in the software cost these are  the overall information system design  the design of the
technological foundations  data structures and files  the design of the detailed information flow and  the design coding and testing of computer programs for the processing functions and control implied by the other three it is gradually being recognized that the fourth computer program implementation while still critically important is only the last step in the process and cannot be done well unless the other three have been done well and unless the detailed task of computer programming has not been started prematurely new techniques for organizing the programming task such as structured programmning  are improving our ability to produce relatively error free programs and test them effectively extension of this strategy to overall structured system design is also gaining acceptance  however as the system design must deal increasingly with human interfaces and interorganizational problems and not merely hardware and software components the complexity and difficulties compound much of the cost usually attributed to software is due to these complexities and difficulties although many programming languages are available for computer program implementation basic assembly level programming continues to be advantageous especially where programs are run repeatedly and efficiency is important the increasing use of minicomputers also tends to require that the appropriate machine language be used since the language facilities available for minicomputers are more limited than for large computers compiler level programming languages continue to be important for ease of implementation and change but assembly language programming is far from dead and is now used more than had previously been predicted also related to software are the requirements for extended character sets ideally we would wish not to be limited by the character set that can be input processed and displayed but in the past practical considerations have constricted the range of choice particularly for output terminals and the software that controls them these limitations are decreasing and more of the potential that had been built into the input and data base segments of some information systems can now be more fully used for output for new major systems of any permanence a design having the potential for a very large character set such as the extended iso sets should be used for information systems the most important software component is data management the requirements for data forms file designs and access paths to the information content for bibliographic systems are the most demanding requirements of all computerized information systems now being implemented only the handling of the full graphics of primary publications is more complex and library and information systems in the future will have to handle graphics as well there are many data elements which are highly variable in size and which are not present in all records the files of a major system can become very large and typically multiple access routes are needed to support various functions besides the basic software means are also needed to support the administration of the files these include standardiza

technological foundations  been extensive development to turn them into effective service systems as the work in libraries turns more to the searching of computer files for subject access search software will become of much more importance for the library community however present search systems grew from relatively simple beginnings and extensions or new approaches are needed to improve the user interface in support of question coding and evaluation of retrievals for good retrieval performance extensive knowledge of the subject matter and the practices used in building the information file are now necessary in the last five to six years the software package industry has grown rapidly unfortunately for bibliographic systems most of these are aimed at the general business market and only a few are directly applicable system environment intraand intercommunity considerations most of this assessment so far has dealt with the nuts and bolts of information technology from which bibliographic control systems can be put together in determining how to assemble those parts to gain the maximum benefit for all parties one must consider the interrelationships among the several communities concerned with bibliographic control the forces for change in bibliographic control and in the mechanisms by which bibliographic control is carried out are those of economics and timeliness in organizing the large volume of recorded knowledge in the modern world to be successful in meeting the challenges presented repetitive and redundant human effort must be eliminated and mechanized bridges must be built for transfer of information within and among the several communities involved publishers abstracting and indexing a and i services libraries other information service activities and information users there has been a tendency for each of these functional communities to act independently and sometimes in conflict with the others considerable progress has been made within each of these communities over the last ten years in applying information technology for example in the library community there are several large local systems several networks and several cooperative ventures of various types in effective operation a recent report lists twenty five networks using varying degrees of automation or preparing for future automation several of them use oclc facilities  however the interfaces among the several communities are far from being as effective as they could be and as they must be for effective service to information users there is little mechanization of basic data capture in publication processes that can be passed on to libraries and abstracting and indexing services item identification and cataloging practices have not been sufficiently harmonized among these communities with a few exceptions there has been little exploitation of search techniques for subject access such
 ronald l wigington and charles n costakos as developed in the information service community to replace certain catalog use functions in libraries effective arrangements have not been made to assure primary document availability to users for all documents abstracted and indexed by the a and i community these intercommunity interfaces currently present the greatest challenge to those building bibliographic control systems in order to achieve useful mechanized linkages among the various activities three areas of agreement must be achieved  appropriate standards for the mechanics of information interchange  appropriate standards for bibliographic analysis and indexing and  viable administrative agreements for exchanging data documents and services of mutual value on a quid pro quo basis or by market mechanisms design and implementation considerations the designer of bibliographic control systems faces an open ended problem in two respects designs must be adaptable if they are to operate successfully across institutional and community boundaries and they must be readily extendable for future purposes in short systems must be designed for change it would be nice to be able to start over without the limitations that are imposed by history or by the shortcomings of the technology that existed when the current generation of information systems were conceived however that is not realistic now nor will it ever be realistic the designer cannot abandon the past but rather must interface effectively with it while handling the present and working toward the future a key aspect of design in a multiinstitutional multicommunity environment is the set of standards and common practices that provide the guidance for achieving intersystem compatibility  while it would be inappropriate to treat that subject in depth in this discussion the following key design principles related to standards and common practices from the perspective of information technology are noted standards whether formal or de facto must deal with information content its control by authority files its representation and its structure in order for automatic processes to interpret properly the stream of information they handle dealing with the mechanical externals alone is not sufficient in fact there may be a variety of detailed ways of coding information that provide equivalent representations of information content and lead to no ambiguity automatic processes can be used for transformations among those forms preserving compatibility at required interfaces and permitting the evolution of various systems or parts of systems with fewer constraints on interrelated sequences of changes of course the greater the homogeneity in mechanical details the simpler the intersystem operation while the consequent avoidance of transformation costs makes it more economical however as
technological foundations  existing systems evolve and grow together mechanical transformation for compatibility will be necessary until the appropriate standards are uniformly observed moreover as technology improves the cost of compatibility preserving conversions becomes less because the technology is so powerful now and is still improving designers should not skimp on machine processes they will get cheaper human functions however will get more expensive system designs should be based on available levels of detail for information content not specific current levels of technological development for input and output implementation must occur gradually while maintaining current operations and system implementors must expect to modify system details as operational experience is gained the total collection of systems that must work together is too large interrelationships are too complex and rates of progress too dissimilar for major changes in basic techniques and facilities to occur universally at the same time conclusions and outlook as in earlier assessments the components are available for building a strong technological foundation for bibliographic control systems as contrasted to the   period there are now many examples which show that effective use of information technology has matured in library systems these include among many others the achievements at the ohio college library center the library of congress stanford ballots the university of chicago and the ohio state university much challenge remains to bring these many separate operations and local networks together and to extend cooperative interfaces outside the bounds of the library community alone the improved availability and costs of these information technology components will be due more to concurrent developments in general computerization in society at large such as office automation electronic consumer products banking and electronic funds transfer than to any attempt of the bibliographic community to influence hardware or software suppliers the bibliographic community should anticipate the technology likely to become available and be prepared to exploit it basic technological areas in need of continued research and development are  mass storage devices  data access and management software especially for operation on minicomputers and in networks  handling of preparation display and search of intermixed text and graphics  partitioning of functions in a distributed system among levels of processors and files  internetwork operations and  user system interfaces such as search software and aids
