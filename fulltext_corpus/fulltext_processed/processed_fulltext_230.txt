  journal of education for library and information science likely to be shared in common spaces eg public and school libraries community centers schools churches the graphic novel should be made available in those places  peer education appears to be a common and effective approach for disseminating hivaids information thus the target population should be included in the development and modification of the materials word of mouth and sharing of information will be enhanced via peer networks  the use of fiction is helpful for making hivaids information more interesting and appealing particularly for youth with a storyline and corresponding visual images successful prevention campaigns also take into account the use of appropriate messages targeted to the specific population in an authentic accessible format albright kawooya  hoff  although much of the existing hivaids prevention information for young people is accurate it is often not readily available nor presented in a format such as graphic novels that they find appealing further due to the large influence of media and advertising today young people are very visual and multimedia learners as flynt and brozo  suggest visual culture is a constant in students daily lives p  young adults are more inclined to read and retain information if it is in an engaging format such as graphic novels that is popular with their generation gavigan  growing evidence suggests that the use of graphic novels in the educational setting can enhance learning and the artistic format can facilitate learning for students with varying learning styles and abilities botzakis  carter  gavigan  krashen  monnin  in addition to these considerations the researchers adopted a theoretical perspective from the field of psychoanalytic psychology rather than looking at cognitive aspects which focus on the ways in which users think about information a psychoanalytic perspective was employed focusing on a more complex set of interactions that occur between the conscious mind and that of the unconscious there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that up to  of decisions are made outside of conscious awareness see for example westen  the features of psychoanalytic theory focus on affect and the expression of emotion where the individual may attempt to avoid distressing thoughts and feelings by suppressing it into the unconscious mind shedler  a psychoanalytic approach suggests an alternative methodology that is more qualitatively based ie projective tests eg storytelling and the thematic apperception tesi  among others the use of projection provides insight into the inner worlds of individuals thoughts and feelings and their meanings pervin  john  and are based on the belief that unconscious thoughts and feelings are accessible through a person projection onto an object or situation projection is commonly used in psychology to investigate how a person responds to ambiguous stimuli while unaware of the assessment technique being used the researchers chose to use this projective approach to create and test the effectiveness of an authentic emotionally focused and culturally targeted graphic novel about the sensitive nature of the topic of hiv aids among young adults the target population themselves are in a better and more emotionally vulnerable position to create a more powerful and effective story than those who are not within that population as members of the target population the young adults were able to create content that would be more relevant to their peers in their local community taking these considerations into account the purpose of this project was to examine the role that graphic novels could play as a resource for increasing hivaids awareness among young adults
information vaccine using graphie novels as an h iv a ids prevention resource  project objectives the overall objective of this project was to provide an ageand culturally appropriate graphic novel about hivaids with young adults in public libraries in south carolina to help them meet the following objectives  young adults who participate in the study will develop an increased awareness of hivaids after reading the graphic novel and participating in the graphic novel book club intervention  participants will acquire the knowledge they need to make informed decisions regarding hivaids the hivaids prevention program information vaccine using graphic novels as an h iv aids prevention resource for young adults is a new intervention program designed to meet the needs of the target audience in south carolina initial project funding was used to hire an illustrator to work with students at a south carolina department of juvenile justice school district scdjjsd high school in summer     the researchers and illustrator worked with incarcerated youth to develop a culturally diverse graphic novel on hivaids using ageand culturallyappropriate text story and illustrations together they created a story that was of interest to the students written in their own vernacular and designed to appeal to the high risk population of africanamerican teens the graphic novel will help young adults acquire the knowledge and resources they need to make informed decisions regarding hivaids the resulting graphic novel aids in the end zone  was piloted with high school students in south carolina in the richland county public library system in columbia sc in  the basic plot of  carnegie foundation community initiative grant from the university of south carolina was awarded in   to pay the graphic novel illustrator for her work in phase  of the project the story is that the new student marcus is named the starting quarterback on the varsity football team former star quarterback brad crafts a plot to get his star spot back by setting up marcus with maria who is hiv positive the graphic novel was used with a pilot group of young adult public library patrons pizza was offered to attract participants to the event which was publicized at the selected branches several book club interventions took place in which participants were given a pre test of their hivaids knowledge before reading the novel and a post test to measure knowledge gains in addition focus groups were held with the participants and the resulting data was incorporated into modifications of the novel research design methodology and analysis techniques in order to better understand the effectiveness of the graphic novel in this project the following research questions were used to guide this study   how does reading a graphic novel about hiv aids affect adolescents understanding of hivaids issues  what are the ways in which adolescents respond to a graphic novel about hiv aids in spring  book club interventions were held with three groups of high school age students in the richland county public library system the researchers were granted institutional review board irb approval before initiating the interventions during the interventions participants were asked to take a survey to assess their knowledge and attitudes about hiv aids prior to reading the graphic novel next each participant received a copy of the graphic novel and was asked to read it after which they were asked to take another survey assessing their knowledge and attitudes about hivaids this provided data about the knowledge gains from the
  journal of education for library and information science graphic novel after the post survey was completed participants participated in a focus group interview to explore their views of the graphic novel what they had learned and what modifications they thought should be made to the graphic novel subjects were each given a  incentive card to participate in the study impact evaluation was measured by analysis of data from the focus groups and preand post survey scores the descriptive questions were designed to show any knowledge gain and change in attitudes among the participants the qualitative questions were designed to provide insight into the nature of the materials impact and provide clues as to which elements of the material were particularly effective in influencing knowledge and attitudes based on the data that resulted from the book club interventions the graphic novel was modified to incorporate suggested improvements findings and discussion the total number of study participants was forty of which  were female and  were male the mean age of participants was  with a range from   the majority of participants  selfidentified as africanamerican  as mixed race and  as white of the forty participants  considered themselves to be at risk and  knew someone who hashad hivaids a comparison of the preand post test survey results taken before and after reading aids in the end zone revealed a number of positive results after reading the graphic novel there was a  decrease in the number of people who believed that hivaids was transmitted genetically the number of people who believed there was a cure for hiv or who were uncertain about a cure was small before reading the novel post test survey results however indicated a significant decrease in the number of erroneous beliefs in a cure for hiv and a significant increase in the number of correct answers figure  figure  is there a cure for hivaids fewer than half of the participants believed that hiv could be spread through breastfeeding prior to reading the graphic novel post test survey results revealed a significant increase in the number of people who after reading the novel understood that hiv can be transmitted through breastfeeding qualitative results from the focus groups also produced informative and interesting data one of the most frequently mentioned issues encountered by the researchers in discussions with other people who read the graphic novel was the lack of a homosexual character in the story when the study participants were asked for their opinions about homosexuality in the story the overwhelming response was that a homosexual character should be added to the story another topic that emerged in the data pertained to maria the only woman in the story there was extensive discussion about misogynistic aspects surrounding maria character the general consensus was that her character needed to be better developed including a deeper portrayal of her own views of herself and her life one participant reported maria needs a little more work her facial expressions look like she doing bad acting
information vaccine using graphie novels as an h iv aids prevention resource   other participants suggested her appearance needed some changes one participant suggested short shorts are a bit trashy make her a bit less seductive another participant said take out the nose ring a third participant added too much tight clothes boobs hanging out another comment that was made suggested the story be expanded to include more about maria friends maria needs to have friends around her one friend should know about it the ending of the story was also discussed since some focus group participants described it as over the top the original story was that the character of sean brad best friend would follow his conscience and grab the microphone at the championship football game of the season and tell everyone there the truth about what brad had done to set up marcus and maria alternative endings were discussed and recorded other concerns identified during the focus groups were also discussed there was some confusion over the point of a discussion depicted between marcus and his parents one participant responded the parents should have had a sex talk with him they should have given him condoms instead of money by showing him the right thing instead of sending him out with money he going to have sex regardless in addition there was a scene where it appeared that marcus might be preparing to hit maria the participants felt that this ruined marcus good guy status and that it should be deleted as one participant said i didn like the punching scene    marcus should have just told everyone she had it rather than hitting her the results of the surveys and focus groups were taken back to the young men at the south carolina juvenile justice department for their consideration the researchers felt that it was important to maintain the authenticity of the story since it was the students creation the students made the final decisions regarding modifications which have now been incorporated into the final story aids in the end zone is scheduled for publication in early  through the young palmetto books imprint of the university of south carolina press future plans are to return to the scdjj to work with another group of incarcerated youth to produce another title in the series this is based on the desire of the students who felt it would be important to create graphic novels about additional social issues they came to the realization that the visuals in the graphic novel aided their learning thereby scaffolding their knowledge in the area of hivaids awareness for example one young man commented i would rather read a graphic novel than a textbook because pictures get to the point quicker another student added visual with text was more fun to read    you can actually see the scenes playing out one student described his pleasure in participating in the project when he stated it gave us the experience to write a book and be a part of a creative thing discussion while the overall findings suggest positive knowledge gains they were not as great as were expected by the researchers this may be explained by an age and education effect however correlating grade with the knowledge gains suggest that most of the participants in the study had completed high school health science where
  journal of education for library and information science hivaids information is part of the curriculum the gains also suggest however that the information presented in the existing curriculum may not be sufficient at getting enough and accurate information to their students overall the preliminary results are promising although the graphic novel may be more effective with young adults who have not yet been exposed to hivaids curriculum ie those students not yet in high school this is a question for future research a psychoanalytic approach was used as part of the rationale for the creation of the graphic novel the target population were themselves selected to author the content in order to create an authentic story drawn from their own emotional perspectives that were projected onto the characters in the story while the initial results are promising further research is needed to determine its effectiveness implications for curriculum library and information science lis education has not traditionally been in the business of creating content which has been more the realm of other disciplines in light of the increasing investigation and understanding of information use however it seems a natural step for lis educators to encourage students to work with local constituents to create content targeted to specific local community needs this study provides preliminary evidence to support the idea that lis educators and professionals can develop useful relevant and effective content the process can be easily replicated in school public and academic library settings for example school librarians can collaborate with classroom teachers to help students create curriculum based graphic novels that address the american association of school librarian standards for the   st century learner and the common core state standards ccss further youth services librarians can provide programming that allows children and young adult patrons to create graphic novels on a variety of topics including social issues that could then be shared with the community the findings of this study are already being incorporated into our lis classes including young adult literature for graduate students and information literacy for undergraduates students in these classes learn how the content for the graphic novel was developed how this process can be replicated as well as how the use of graphic novels can scaffold learning in a variety of content areas conclusion the quest to provide effective hiv aids prevention resources for young adults must examine the texts that they value such as graphic novels this is the first study of its kind to provide scientifically based research that examines whether or not graphic novels can be an effective h iv a ids prevention tool for young adults the students who participated in the graphic novel intervention project acquired the knowledge and resources they needed to make informed decisions regarding hivaids including how to reduce or eliminate risk factors how to talk with adults and  or partners where to get tested for hiv and more the findings suggest that aids in the end zone has the potential to significantly impact on young adults in south carolina since it provides the target population with a greater knowledge of hivaids issues after participating in the graphic novel intervention future study the results of this pilot study were encouraging and additional funding will be sought to initiate similar analysis nationally and worldwide a primary goal is to extend this study to a more global audience and replicate it in other cultures specifically the university of south carolina school of library and information science has a partnership with royal i mutee
