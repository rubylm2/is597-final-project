the contemporary critique of literature for young people bears more than a trace of the nineteenthcentury concern that reading has both a powerful and an influential effect on readers anne lundin writes that the very victorian horizons of reception that informed the criticism and commentary on childrens books in the late nineteenth century  p  continue into the present and include contemporary ways in which children and their literature are both marginalized and mythologized  p  as the old refrain the right book for the right child at the right time persists librarians and critics continue to debate the parameters of this socalled rightness contemporary critical redemptions of the nancy drew series for example serve as proof that the professional concept of rightness in terms of book recommendation is subject to historical revision what however are we to make of those titles that currently occupy the position that the nancy drew series once occupied those contemporary popular works that are subject to the scorn of professionals and the adult general public but whose popularity among young readers is notable in the spirit of shirley foster and judy simonss call for scholars to rescue devalued texts from conventional critical hierarchies so that questions of literary exclusion and determinants of taste can be addressed with some understanding of their sources  p  i would like to examine the clique a contemporary popular series of novels for girls that has been criticized in the mainstream and professional media but that includes thematic content similar to some of the more lauded midnineteenthcentury domestic fiction for girls by making a thematic comparison of this popular twentyfirstcentury series with nineteenthcentury domestic fiction for girls much of which is now considered classic literature we can establish a tradition in girls writing more prevalent than perhaps has been thought and can as we contrast the respective professional receptions of these works consider how our selection practice is informed by a historically consistent impetus domestic fiction for girls and chick lit for girls tracing a similar literary path domestic fiction for girls developed in part as a result of the gradual departmentalizing of childrens literature in accordance with the gender of the presumed reader lundin writes the decades of the s and s displayed a growing consciousness of gender and a more rigid classification of childrens books  while books for the youngest readers tended to be more genderinclusive those for older children divided largely into adventure fiction for boys and domestic chronicles for girls  p  sarah wadsworth argues that the market for girls fiction was slower to develop than that for boys writing contending that one reason for the recognition of boys as a separate audience well before girls was that the boys market was seen as including girls while the girls market apparently excluded boys  p  according to beverly lyon clark louisa may alcotts little women was perhaps the first american book explicitly directed to girls as an audience at a time when childrens literature was just starting to undergo gender segregation  p  prior to the publication of this novel girls as wadsworth notes enjoyed fiction that would be labeled boys fiction and would likely have participated in what jane h hunter would call the family reading circle during which one member of a family would read aloud to the others victorian girls did read on their own however their reading material was carefully monitored hunter notes the guiding role that parents would have played then in a girls reading life as reading good books was of course a way of demonstrating virtue  p  the development of a specific type of writing for girls likely grew in part out of a public concern for the reading of the young and as an extension of an existing body of womens writing the domestic novel in the late nineteenth century just prior to the juvenile series boom librarians and other concerned adults worried about the effects of inexpensively produced sensationalist fiction on child readers although as gail murray writes young people were not the original audience for such publications much of the criticism of this type of material focused on its detrimental effect on children  p  the presumed effects of sensational fiction were in marked contrast to those effects good literature would have on a reader according to wadsworth literature for young people had cultural work to perform namely preparing  girls for adulthood and for girls this meant teaching them that a womans most valuable contribution was in using her feminine influence for good and virtuous ends within the context of the domestic sphere  p  if as lundin posits girls books existed as a transition to adult reading and to prepare young women for their social roles ahead  p  a juvenile version of an existing genre for womenthe domestic novelwould be the ideal solution to the perceived problem of girls reading the domestic novel is considered a type of sentimental fiction that offered an idealized form of what the christian family should be and soon became obsessed with the power relations within the family and consequent violations of identity  np of the domestic fiction published for girls murray relates that this genre like its adult counterpart was written principally by women and focused on character development and moral suasion  p  and she alludes to the books functions as solidifiers of class and gender strata because young nineteenthcentury readers also read materials intended for a broad adult audience a phenomenon that is noted in lundin  and hunter  girls familiar with a diet of domestic fiction for women like charlotte brontÃ« jane eyre  or harriet beecher stowes uncle toms cabin  transitioned through what would now be considered crossover titles like susan warners the wide wide world  to alcotts little women  childrens books too would have been read by nineteenthcentury adults as lundin notes six of the ten bestsellers in the united states between  and  were childrens books heidi treasure island a childs garden of verses huckleberry finn little lord fauntleroy and king solomons mines  p  as domestic fiction written for girls developed as a type of literature it incorporated a number of devices that would become familiar not only to its own readers but also to readers of the women version of the genre murray describes the common tropes of the domestic fiction novel and concludes that most of the stories written for young people introduce an orphaned or partially orphaned protagonist exhibit an omnipresent awareness of class difference and tend to use a characters illness as the catalyst for either religious conversion or moral reformation  p  while alcotts little women does not feature an orphaned protagonist the father is absent for most of the story and the central sisters in the narrative are forced to strike out on their own to some degree to support the family the situation of alcotts march family is certainly not as dramatic as the situation of susan warners orphaned and unwanted ellen in the wide wide world however warners  novel was as likely an influence on alcott as anne scott macleod argues it was for martha finleys elsie dinsmore a novel published the same year as little women alcotts jack and jill a novel published twelve years after little women includes more of the features traditionally associated with the domestic novel for girls the main character is seriously injured in a sledding accident and confined to her bed but with the guidance of a character macleod calls an ideal woman emerges from her infirmary transformed macleod observes that alcotts jack and jill parallels closely an earlier  and very popular girls story by susan coolidge sarah c woolsey and she notes the similarities between coolidges what katy did and alcotts novel  p  as in alcotts book coolidges spunky female focalizer katy falls victim to a crippling accident she falls from a swing she had been forbidden to play on but following the example of her equally infirm role model cousin helen emerges from her illness a model of feminine decorum these plot conventions and narrative themes grew common enough in nineteenthcentury literature for girls that they can be considered characteristic features of what was then a nascent genre of domestic fiction for girls the prevalence of plotlines of redemption and characters who become role models for others in these nineteenthcentury stories for girls seems to follow a move from early century moralism to late century romanticism as the girls books discussed above developed from the general domestic fiction written in the midnineteenth century and as they straddled the traditions of morality and romanticism associated with nineteenthcentury childrens literature an interesting picture of this hybrid genre for girls appears domestic fiction as a form of writing associated with an audience of women and girls became heavily invested in perpetuating an idea of feminine identity as novels of this type increasingly served as a prime conduit of character formation effectively positioning mothers and daughters within the selfsacrificial roles they were by most accounts preordained to play  p  these textual features and the commonality of themes and situations across novels performed what wadsworth would call cultural work and in the words of suzanne m ashworth delineated a white middleclass identity and diffused its ideals to the masses  p  thus domestic fiction for women and girls took shape as a genre of contradictions attached to both the authorization and the dissemination of a narrow idea of the female voice as well as to its own capacity for instruction and control contemporary chick lit written for girls appeared in much the same way that domestic fiction for girls materialized in the nineteenth centuryas an outgrowth of an existing genre of writing associated with women readers and writers jennifer scanlon describes chick lit as that phenomenally successful body of girlcentric fiction initiated with the publication of bridget joness diary in   that most frequently features young urban professional female protagonists who while not taking themselves too seriously work through romantic career and body image trials and tribulations  np rebecca vnuk writes of chick lits similarities to and differences from the broader genre of womens writing noting both mainstream womens fiction and chick lit deal in similar themeslove marriage work friendshipand are written by women for women  chick lit  is distinguished by its humorwisecracking characters or ridiculous situations usually involving work or dating  p  like the domestic novel contemporary chick lit for women and girls is womancentered and usually womanauthored however whereas the domestic novel focuses on the home and valorizes submission chick lits preoccupation with the romantic status of the heroine is often conflated with concerns about her independent progressat school or at work stephanie harzewski has noted the debt chick lit owes to its nineteenthcentury predecessor chick lit reinterprets the legacies of the novel of manners and domestic fictions marriage plot chronicling the heroines fortunes on the marriage market and assessing contemporary courtship behavior dress and social motives  p  while chick lit for girls didnt surface out of a concern for young womens reading its appearance as a distinct genre of young adult and intermediate literature is like domestic fiction for girls related to the popularity of the adult version of the genre among young people the movie version of the first novel of chick lit for women bridget joness diary and the subsequent publication of similar novels featuring hip young heroines likely attracted adolescent readers to the genre in addition meg cabot a popular writer for young adults her princess diaries series of books for teens has spawned two movies of its own has also written chick lit for women this author has become a crossover success carrying her readers across publishing age lines christine meloni reports that the first example of chick lit written for girls is considered to be louise rennisons angus thongs and fullfrontal snogging  a novel written as diary entries like those of her adult contemporary bridget jones  np this book generated a number of sequels all of which are considered part of the authors confessions of georgia nicholson series these premier examples of chick lit for women and chick lit for girls appeared as british imports in the us market and it is this glamorous foreignness that distinguishes both of these first novels domestic fiction for girls and chick lit for girls share a number of the same characteristics in fact a discussion of the formulaic elements of each reveals more similarity than difference like their nineteenthcentury prose sisters chick lit for girls may feature a symbolically orphaned characterthe outsider at school abandoned by her friends or first boyfriend or the new girl thrust into a strange and sometimes unfriendly environment while chick lit for girls may not employ a seriously ill character as a literary device to encourage readers to contemplate their own morality and mortality the trials of the novels heroines involve the resolution of a fear of social death by way of exclusion from a popular or exclusive clique whereas domestic fiction for girls discourages negotiation of established parameters of womanhood chick lit for girls may be critical of current styles and manners and emphasize the heroines attempt to navigate high school life  par  joanna webb johnson argues that both domestic fiction and chick lit for girls share much common ground  p  the heroines of each all arguably evolve during the course of the stories presenting lessons learned and reaching for higher moral ground  p  like domestic fiction for girls chick lit for girls appears as the result of an assembly of influences a distinct little sister version of chick lit for women contemporary chick lit for girls appeared in the space between two distinct trends in young adult publishing in the s critics lamented what they considered to be the prevalence of the bleak book for young adults a panel discussion was devoted to edgy young adult novels at the ala annual conference in  during which the dk ink senior editor richard jackson noted the trend and the popular response to it in the media when reviewers today worry about bleak stories they are worrying on behalf of the audience about the readiness of young readers to face lifes darkest corners  np one year later booklist columnist michael cart also observed that the mainstream print media had been buzzing about a new trend in publishing the spate of what journalists are calling bleak books  p  the publication of rennisons book in  was a marked change of pace because although angus thongs and fullfrontal snogging does purport to describe its teen heroines trials and tribulations  it is a distinctly light and humorous offering this novel and the chick lit for girls that would follow represents a departure from the other childrens and young adult literature genre that grew in popularity in the s and early s fantasy just as domestic fiction for girls was an outgrowth of a genre of women writing and settled into a fissure between literary impulses in childrens writing so chick lit for girls the junior version of chick lit distinguishes itself from the bleak books and harry potterinspired fantasies of its generation the publication of both types of literaturenineteenthcentury domestic fiction for girls and contemporary chick lit for girlsreflects a mode of production invested in the definition of and following this the targeted marketing to a distinct audience of young women in a discussion of the segmentation along gender lines of childrens literature in the nineteenth century wadsworth writes of the symbiotic relationship between author and audience just as william t adams helped to define not only the boys series but also the audience for boys books so alcott as the most important contemporary american author to write books specifically for girls was instrumental in defining shaping reinforcing and revising the qualities interests and aspirations of the girls who comprised that market  p  clark suggests that alcotts decision to write with an audience of girls in mind was not entirely her own and asserts alcott consciously set out in little women to write for girls in response to her editors request  p  although clark goes on to indicate the crossover appeal the novel exertsin terms of gender and agein the nineteenth century and today her hint that the nineteenthcentury novel was a form of publication somehow targeted to a gendered audience and that this targeting as it was requested by alcotts editor was in some ways a marketing strategy is notable this same targeting strategy is evident in professional discussions of chick lit for girls kit alderdices  article for publishers weekly describes rennisons discovery of a niche market in writing for girls in terms similar to wadsworths quoting cynthia eagan a senior editor at little brown alderdice writes louise rennison identified girls cravings for funny more sophisticated material featuring protagonists their own age  np if both alcott and rennison can be seen as the earliest writers of domestic fiction for girls and chick lit for girls respectively it is especially interesting to glimpse what seems to be a strategic consideration of a gendered audience in the creation of their works the clique and its nineteenthcentury sisters a thematic comparison the clique series written by lisi harrison and published by little brown under the auspices of the bookpackaging company alloy inc is a popular chick lit paperback series aimed at preteen girls and designed to ride on the coattails of similar novels for older teens which in turn follow the new tradition established by their own adult counterparts like the alloyproduced gossip girl and alist series harrisons series contrasts the lives and attitudes of its two main characters massie block a twelveyearold queen bee at her exclusive westchester new york private school and claire lyons the daughter of massies fathers best friend who is forced to move into the guesthouse on the block property after her father loses his job and the family relocates from florida whereas massie and her best friendsdubbed the pretty committeeare stylish jaded and preoccupied with fashion boys and status claire is uninterested in clothes and gossip but still longs to become part of massies exclusive clique because of its massmarket means of production the liberal sprinkling of its narrative with designer brand names and popular culture references and its association with popular series fiction the clique is an example of the type of popular literature that libraries are reluctant to purchase as patty campbell wrote in  of the qualityversuspopularity divide in collection development decisions librarians who have perhaps been made a trifle paranoid by their perception that the commercial success of series paperbacks is eroding financial support for quality fiction have begun to see the situation in simplistic terms of good guys and bad guys  p  ten years later campbell perhaps in a fit of her own paranoia labeled the clique and its massmarket sister series ya chicklit style at its worst  p  meanwhile wolf addressed the clique and other similar series in a new york times article calling the series scary and creepily photorealistic and warning parents against their purchase  this type of critique of young peoples literatureand of girls fiction in particularis not new however it represents only the latest chapter in the history of young peoples reading interests and practices nineteenthcentury domestic fiction for girls like contemporary chick lit for girls enjoyed popular status but garnered little critical attention beyond mention in library catalogs and selection guides although the popularity of alcotts little women has endured and it enjoys classic status today clark notes its critical reception has been historically varied  the same might be said about warners the wide wide world famously redeemed by jane tompkins in her  sensational designs or about coolidges what katy did discussed along with what the authors call other devalued texts like little women and the wide wide world in foster and simonss what katy read feminist rereadings of classic stories for girls   as critics look back and reread and reconsider and as foster and simons write rescue girls texts of the past questions of literary exclusion and determinants of taste can be addressed with some understanding of their sources  p  this same work can be done with contemporary fiction as well and as i have traced the similarities in lineage between nineteenthcentury domestic fiction for girls and twentieth and twentyfirstcentury chick lit for girls i draw from historical examples of domestic fiction for girls to call attention to those themes in the clique as a representative series of chick lit for girls that appear as echoes of the literary past two major themes emerge both in the primary texts of domestic fiction for girls and chick lit for girls and in the secondary critical discussions of them social class and its meaning and the domestic sphere and its significance while campbell criticizes the clique and other contemporary chick lit for teens calling such literature dramas of social class  p  this literary recognition of class and status is not particular to contemporary girls fiction stephanie foote identifies the presence and negotiation of class issues in little women for example writing that the novels depiction of the characters growing awareness of which feeling to have about which kinds of people is an indicant of the characters and by extension the readers awareness of the codes of behavior in an increasingly stratified society  p  similarly the characters in warners the wide wide world and cooldiges what katy did demonstrate recognition of the manners and conducts associated with class because these novels fall into a larger tradition of domestic fiction for girls and women and because the definition of this form is linked to the novels depictions of the home and womans domestic sphere it is especially interesting to note the ways in which this space has been historically constituted and i argue in which it remains circumscribed class in the clique and in domestic fiction for girls like the domestic fiction of the nineteenth century the clique series concerns itself with issues of class and while the contemporary narrative pays much attention to the details of the lives of the wealthy the novels are primarily sympathetic to the middleclass character in the series middleclass newcomer claire plays the role of what ashworth calls the homespun heroine  p  and although she is criticized by her upperclass schoolmates and massie in particular for being unfashionable and unsophisticated receives the warmest portrayal when on claires first day of school she accepts a ride in massies familys limousine and gapes at the mansions in which massies friends live massie barks at claires attempt to take pictures everyone lives like this around here so you better get used to it  p  after the girls arrive at school claires eyes widen when she sees the parking lot  filled with mercedes jaguars lexus suvs bmw convertibles and even a few limos  p  claire mentally compares this parking lot to the one at her old school which just had yellow school buses and a few beatup toyotas and hondas that belonged to teachers  p  these scenes reinforce the class difference between the two girls that had been established in a conversation massie has with her limousine driver when she asks him about claires family are they poor massie asks saying the word poor the same way her mother said fat  p  issac the driver responds in the negative noting not everyone can afford everything they want  p  this scenealmost a reversal of a scene in little women foote arguesis an example of status dissonance which centers on how others perceive the ambitions and limitations of the march family  p  when meg is invited to attend a series of dances hosted by a wealthier family she is in footes words overtaken by a host of negative emotions that center on the different kinds of value accorded to different social actors  p  meg overhears some of the posh guests gossiping about the march family and herself in particular in much the same way massie gossips about claire the scene in the clique in which the existence of what she considers poor people is made real to massie reads the same way in which this scene from little women might if told from the perspective of the wealthy guests with this exchange massie her family and by extension her wealthy friends become markers for higher society while claire and her family though according to the limousine driver not poor are of lower class massies conversation with isaac appears in the first pages of the first book in the series and serves to set up a system of contrasts between wideeyed claire and snappy massie and between middle and upperclass life to which the series will continually allude just as domestic fiction for girls camouflaged discussions of class by referencing the importance of the seemingly classnonspecific trait of refinement the clique too codes its references to class in contemporary terms using a language of brand names to signify the middle and upperclass status of the characters at the time when the production of domestic fiction for girls was increasing explicit discussions of class were ironically considered dÃ©classÃ© though status issues and the concurrent symbology of class were tacitly noted and understood macleod notes that although nineteenthcentury americans would have been reluctant to acknowledge the presence of a class system class attitudes were most evident in the authors sensitivity to differences in manner and deportment and the attention given to this system of differences belies this supposed disinterest  p  writers made allusions to class in domestic fiction for girls in a code of sorts emphasizing the importance of refinement and especially gentility the nature of which gillian avery writes was something that preoccupied many of the earlier american writers for girls  p  this same device can be found in the clique although the characters do not explicitly identify themselves as upper class or middle class many of the novels plots revolve around the middleclass characters attempt to fit in with her wealthy classmates many of these attempts to fit in involve comparisons of the brand names of clothing each character is wearing to confirm her class status deirdre f baker calls this coding system that other language of american culturebrand names and notes that each of these names has precise significance and is used preciselyassuming the readerconsumer knows the reference  p  in massies milieu and the world of the clique specific clothing stores and brands have either positive or negative connotations on a trip to the mall massie notes that the cheap knockoffs found in the midpriced womens clothing store the limited had always been an endless source of jokes among her friends  p  sneakers with the keds brand are equally suspect as massies friend kristen decrees better dead than ked  p  in comparison the brands worn by massie and her friends which include versace bcbg and prada are given the stamp of approval only once is the significantly higher cost of designer fashions like these mentioned and when it is the price is noted with disbelief by claire upon sneaking a peek at the price tag on an alberta ferretti halter that massies friends bought her as a gift claire asks herself how can a top thinner than toilet paper be that expensive  the price tag said seven hundred and eighty dollars   p  the placement of this sole revelation of the cost of massies clothing in the first fifty pages of the first book in the series serves as a referencenot unlike the reference point created when massie asked isaac about claires familys povertyagainst which the rest of massies fashion choices throughout the series can be measured in the language of the serieswhich has already positioned massie and claire as character foilsmassies clothing stands as a symbol for her upperclass status while claires clothes she wears the offending keds become markers of her lower station the attention paid to fashionparticularly brandname fashionand its meaning is not a literary phenomenon restricted to contemporary texts nineteenthcentury domestic fiction for girls too included purposeful descriptions of characters dress explicit descriptions of clothing prove equally as meaningful in domestic fiction for girls here too the rules for appropriate adornment are specific and sometimes contradictory in coolidges what katy did the appearance of two distinctly dressed characters in succession serves to distinguish between genteel fashion and tawdriness when the titular character katy invites a school friend for a visit she is surprised at her guest appearance about halfpast ten imogen arrived she was dressed in a lightblue barege with low neck and short sleeves and wore coral beads in her hair white satin slippers and a pair of yellow gloves the gloves and slippers were quite dirty and the barege was old and darned but the general effect was so very gorgeous that the children who were dressed for play in gingham frocks and white aprons were quite dazzled at the appearance of their guest  p  foster and simons argue that imogens presence and katys eventual disinterest in the girl she found at first to be so glamorous represents a romantic distortion of womanhood that is shattered when katy realizes that imogen is vulgar and selfdramatizing  p  massie too is just as vulgar and selfimportant as imogen and claires fascination and ours with her is not unlike katys interest in imogenan interest it may be noted she eventually outgrows katy doesnt outgrow her fascination with another figure whose style is described in coolidges novel her invalid cousin helen when katy meets cousin helen for the first time she is wearing a sort of loose traveling thing of pretty grey stuff with a rosecoloured bow and bracelets and a round hat trimmed with a feather  p  later katy finds cousin helen lying on the sofa all dressed for the day in a fresh blue muslin with blue ribbons and pretty bronze slippers with rosettes on the toes  p  katy is taken with cousin helens prettiness but worries that her relatives decoration makes her worldly when she asks cousin helen if it is worldly to have pretty things when youre sick cousin helen replies pretty things are no more worldly than ugly ones except when they spoil us by making us vain or careless of the comfort of other people  pp   in its appropriate context it would seem pretty things are not only appropriate they can even inspire the wearer while foster and simons aptly identify cousin helen as an archetypal fictional figure of the period the sofa invalid who becomes an icon of gendered moral excellence they focus on what they call helens selfabnegation and not on her pleasing appearance  p  foster and simons argue that helens function as the domestic angel involves advising and comforting the erring or suffering  p  in the home and as she attends to this activityand redecorates the room in which she will be boundher appearance in katys familys house gives the home a different air beautificationof others souls of herself of her roomis cousin helens gift and these are significantly conflated during her visit the lesson in what katy did involves not a dismissal of adornment or care for ones appearance instead cousin helen emphasizes the importance of the manner in which this practice is carried out cousin helens advice is one example of the advice domestic fiction for girls offered its readers regarding the appropriate limitations to fashion and fashionable expression the clique offers similar guidance when massie learns that some classmates are planning a boygirl halloween party so that everyone would be talking about them and not massie for a change  p  massie publicly humiliates the wouldbe party planners by announcing her own party first while it would be easy to feel embarrassment for the two girls massie shames in front of their classmates the narrative reveals through the description of their clothing that these young womens plans are akin to social climbing and that they are not in massies league instead of sporting caramelcolored highlights  that made her eyes sparkle just like her stylist jakkob had promised and fashionable clothes that flatter her body like massies brown suede miniskirt that made her butt look even perkier than usual  p  massies halloween party competitors make unwise sartorial choices that reveal their lowerclass positions becca wilder one of the conspirators wears girly chiffon tops that always look out of place on her stocky physique and her hair hangs flat and lifeless  p  beccas friend and coconspirator is characterized by her addiction to spray tanning that leaves her skin constantly orange  p  in the world of the clique clothing should not only be sexy sophisticated and whimsical but should also look good on the wearer as this care with appearance signifies wealth and privilege becca and her friend might be wearing fashionable items but their execution is incorrect and therefore less meaningfully classy in this context becca and her friend become like what katy dids imogen who foster and simons write acts out  the fantasies which she has imbibed from romantic literature  p  becca and her unnamed friend are acting out a fantasy of their own romantic heroinemassieand just as imogens odd imitation proved laughable their attempts as mimicry fail as well while it would seem that the series emphasis on the fabulous life of the upperclass characters and the scorn the cliques narrative holds for girls like becca who just cant get it right would make the novels a type of aspirational fiction the plots of each underscore the triumphs of the middleclass claire just as macleod observes about domestic fictionbroadly speaking the social attitudes set out in the stories were those of democratic middle class society which disapproved of snobbishness and fashionableness  p the same is true about the clique claire is indeed enamored of massies lifestyle and endeavors to join her popular group of friends however the best friend she finds on the first day of school turns out to be much more loyal than massies gang even when massie and company try to embarrass her in public claire manages to come out on top when on claires first day of school massies friends try to humiliate her by dripping red paint on the seat of her chair she is sent to the nurses office by a male teacher who thinks she has started her period once in the nurses office claire is allowed to choose a replacement outfit from the schools lostandfound box which turns out to be stuffed with the type of designer clothes claires family would not normally be able to afford claire is also the first of the girls in the clique to get a boyfriend a fact that horrifies massie when claire confirms that she and her crush are in fact boyfriend and girlfriend massie is shocked claire had a real boyfriend before she did that was not supposed to happen  p  joyce irene whalley notes a similar literary trend involving the rewarding of the morally pure protagonist writing of the practice of virtue that would invariably bring temporal rewards in eighteenthcentury childrens morality literature  p  j s bratton traces this theme through the nineteenth century and documents such stories in which virtue and hard work are straightforwardly met with material reward  p  in the clique claires tolerance of massies and her friends practical joke brings her the reward of expensive albeit used clothing and later a boyfriend these returns for good behavior represent social capital in the girls world although the clique namebrandpeppered narrative betrays a fascination with the life of the upper class the novels reveal a unique type of unhappiness and dissatisfaction associated with privilege this is not a new message in literature for girls and it operates here as in domestic fiction for girls to congratulate the middleclass character macleod observes the presence of this attitude in midcentury domestic fiction noting that in literature unless they were also virtuous the wealthy characters were surely miserable in spite of their riches  p  certainly wealthy but definitely not virtuous massie worries that her money and fashionable wardrobe arent enough to secure her place in her private schools social hierarchy she entertains a moment of panic when she hears about becca and her friends plans to host their peer groups first boygirl party and worries am i slipping are people starting to look at me as a popularity hasbeen  why didnt i think of the boygirl party it should have been my idea i always think of everything first  p  in a later novel massie faces a threat of a different kind one of her friends cousins has come to visit and although this cousins wardrobe is distinctly dÃ©classÃ© and features boots that arent even made of real leather and the latest knockoffs from contempo casuals an inexpensive girls clothing store  p  the strangers confidence and professed knowledge of teenage boys makes her a popular figure among massies friends when the cousin alludes to the fact that at thirteen she is no longer a virgin massie scoffs at her overshare but deep down inside she was starving for more information  p  in the face of this voice of experience massies fancy clothes and status symbols mean nothing other girls even start to copy the visiting cousins style in spite of the fact that massie has publicly criticized the girl although the cousin ultimately proves to be a conniving kleptomaniac on whom the girls exact revenge the moments in this story in which massie is forced to consider the relative value of her moneyed style hint at the conclusion domestic fiction for girls drives home the lives of the wealthy are likely miserable little women offers the most blatant example of this type of comparison as foote writes the homes of the marches and their more privileged neighbors the laurences are compared according to foote the descriptive language that warmly depicts the modest march home in comparison to the cold laurence mansion privileges the social value of the marches even as it privileges the economic value of the laurences  p  in the clique claire as the underdog heroine is the socially privileged character however the descriptions of massies familys wealth and their luxuries are offered competing attention the bedroom and domesticity in the clique and in domestic fiction for girls the sanctity of the home and the family is a theme that critics observe permeates nineteenthcentury domestic fiction according to avery such sentiment can be encountered over and over again in childrens books of the last century  p  similarly the place of women in this domestic idyll can be found in countless  books of the period  p  although a nineteenthcentury heroine may come from a privileged background avery observes the american writers for girls insisted that their heroines must devote themselves to domesticity  p  even rebellious heroines like the title character of coolidges what katy did would soon learn to embrace domestic virtues when typically an accident or emotional crisis led to enlightenment and converted the rebel into the perfect domestic angel  p  while female readers today are unlikely to find the same brand of domestic encouragement in their literature a subtle emphasis on what cultural studies critics call girls bedroom culture can be found in much girls fiction in the clique the sanctity of the main characters bedrooms and in one volume their temporary girls only clubhouse is notable as the fictional activities contained within these settings recall both domestic ideals and bedroom cultural mores the girls room as a separate sphere in which its occupant might prepare for domesticity is a phenomenon argues hunter born in the nineteenth century hunter contends that the complex design of the victorian house  embodies cultural preoccupations with specialized functions particularly distinguishing between public and private worlds  p  one such private world would be the girls room as it provided a perfect opportunity  for practicing for a role as mistress of a household  p  the girls room may also be considered a symbol of the victorian girls passage from childhood to womanhood when macleod writes puberty would be for her the beginning of her imprisonment in the womans sphere  p  macleod argues that the presence of this theme of transition in fiction for girls signifies the import of this development from girlhood to adulthood to womanhood it is surely significant that so many women who wrote girls stories chose as their subject the transition from childhood to adolescence or more accurately to young adulthood  p  the style of such stories embodies this thematic concern as writes macleod they were intensely domestic and interior  p  this preoccupation with domesticity has carried over to contemporary fiction as in the clique in which female characters find peace and room for selfexpression in their bedrooms the term bedroom culture was coined by angela mcrobbie and jenny garber to describe what they considered to be the nexus of contemporary girls culture in their influential  essay girls and subcultures the two authors observe that girls negotiate a different leisure space and different personal spaces from those inhabited by boys  p  the location of this leisure space is determined in part by the types of commodities directed exclusively toward the adolescent female market and by the activities these commodities encourage although some forms of popular music may be taken up and appreciated by an audience of boys and girls alike mcrobbie and garber write that girls use the associated posters records and magazines in a different context from those in which boys use them and note that the activities girls tend to participate in around these commoditiesthe rituals of trying on clothes and experimenting with hairstyles and makeupwere home based activities  p  mcrobbie and garber conclude it might be suggested that girls culture  operated within the vicinity of the home or the friends home  p  in their summary of research related to girls bedroom culture jacqueline reidwalsh and claudia mitchell explain that the relegation of girls to the bedroom was largely the result of parental control whereby girls actions and activities were restricted more to the private sphere while boys were allowed to roam more freely in the public space of the street  p  because these contemporary observations about girls bedroom culture are reminiscent of the nineteenthcentury interest in girls domesticity it is especially interesting to consider the significance of the bedroom in the clique massies bedroom is the locus of her control and her concern with its neatness and stylishness reflects its importance to the character and within the series everything in massies room is whitethe leather chaise by the bay window the sheepskin rug the painted brick walls the dozen fresh tulips and her flatscreen mac  p with the exception of the fluffy purple duvet which was the only burst of color  p  the room is further accessorized with massiesized mannequins that she has made to her measurements every year and on which she assesses potential outfits when claire moves into massies room while her familys house is being renovated the rooms usual order is disturbed and massie can barely look at the six boxes and two scuffedup armystyle duffel bags  without feeling like her eyes were going to bleed  p  although she initially thinks having claire as a temporary roommate will be fun massie begins to feel like claires stuff was sucking up the oxygen in her room and making it difficult for anyone else to breathe  p  massie hosts what she calls exclusive sleepovers in her bedroom tries on clothes before her mirror the narrative notes that she tilts her head to the right when assessing a new outfit because the offcenter angle helped her see what she looked like through someone elses eyes  p  and sings along with pop music effectively animating the rituals mcrobbie and garber describe massie is hesitant to tell the members of the pretty committee that she and claire will be temporarily sharing a bedroom because she fears that the thought of the two of them sharing such close quarters will make them jealous when her friends note that claires wardrobe has been expanded to include some of massies clothing massie realizes that this probably wasnt the best time to tell her friends that claire would be sharing her bedroom they were acting a little jealous and she didnt want to rub it in their faces  p  even though claire spends time with a separate group of friends her allaccess pass to massies inner sanctum expands what the pretty committee might perceive as claires influence further than just living on massies property would allow the bedroom is equally important to the main character of what katy did the decoration of the room and its sanctity are emphasized in this domestic tale katys cousin helen provides the inspiration for katys own decoration of her room when the ill cousin visits katy notes the slight changes cousin helen made in the room in which she would be staying all the house was neat but somehow aunt izzies rooms were never pretty observes katy cousin helens smart rearrangement of furniture allows katy to see at once that the blue room had never looked like this  p  later in the story when katy too is confined to her room cousin helen encourages her to make her sickroom such a delightful place that visitors will want to come to you  p  when the family celebrates valentines day together in katys room it is bright and inviting and adorned with trinkets and decorations cousin helen had been sending her the gradual change in katys room serves as a metaphor for her development into what cousin helen names the heart of the house when cousin helen comes again to visit she saw the change in katy the gentle expression of her eyes the womanly look the pleasant voice the politeness the tact in advising others without seeming to advise  p  the change the room has wrought has been chronicled in what katy did in the same way the presence of the multiply mature massie mannequins in her room demonstrates massies own growth massies bedroomwhere she tries on clothes and makeup and experiments with hairstylesis a symbol of her early adolescence in the developmental space between girlhood and womanhood her room is a pure white that she fantasizes messing up with her crush when cousin nina appears at one of massies friday night sleepovers she judges massies room to be an indicant of her immaturity ive never seen an allwhite room before its so innocent and virginal and look nina pointed to the mannequins maysee still plays with dolls  p  massie immediately flares at this accusation and retorts those are not dawls and they probably cost more than your entire until she is cut off by a friend  p  massies secret wish however is revealed in a fantasy she has about tearing apart her own bedroom massie was so tired of her mother nagging to her keep sic her room spotless and couldnt think of anyone shed rather mess it up with than cam fisher  p  she dreams of inviting cam over to her house and leading him up to her bedroom in a scene heavy with seduction what about your mother cam would ask cam would plug his ipod into her speakers and blast some strokes song  then massie and cam would start pulling the books off her bookshelf and hurling them to the floor they would tear the goose feathers out of her down comforter and throw them at each other like they were having a snowballfight they would toss her cds around like frisbees and yank the evenly folded sweaters out of her walkin closet and lob them into the air  they would wrap toilet paper around her mannequin and write their names with lipstick on her bay window they would be laughing so hard massies stomach would start to feel like she had just done a thousand crunches but she would ignore the pain because shed be having too much fun  p  the entire fantasy scene is a literal and figural deflowering cam plugs his ipod into massies speakers they rip apart the bed and careen around the room and even though the experience would hurt she would ignore the pain because shed be having too much fun the scene is distinctly sexual the rooms destruction represents the subversive impulse massie has to go against her mothers desire that massie room and her person remain pure massies fantasy deflowering of her bedroom is rendered in a distinctly different tone than that of a surprisingly similar scene in the wide wide world a comparison of these reveals a historical change of mind regarding girls purity in the wide wide world ellen the protagonist takes special pains to put the bedroom she occupies in her aunts home in beautiful order  p  when as she lies ill in bed a mischievous neighbor pays her a visit ellen worries that the other girl will destroy the room she has worked so hard to right the other girl nancy takes advantage of ellens weakness and mocks her as she opens her closets and trunk until all her nicely stowed piles of white clothes were ruthlessly hurled out and tumbled about her capes tried on her summer dresses unfolded displayed criticized nancy decided one was too short another very ugly a third horribly illmade and when she had done with each it was cast out of her way on one side or the other as the case might be  p  in this scene ellens purity is threatened against her will her white clothes are the first items mentioned and they have been ruthlessly hurled out and tumbled aboutby another women no less nancys removal of ellens clothing from her trunk renders the girl symbolically naked and on top of that indignity makes her body the target of nancys scorn in warners version of the bedroom defilement ellen is not in control and the experience is as frightening as it is messy in harrisons version massies pleasure comes from the freedom of control the fantasy allows her although massie fantasizes that the destruction of her bedroom would be pleasurable and exhilarating ellens real experience of that destruction proves distressing however both scenes share a common premise both rooms are expressions of the characters will and control spotless status notwithstanding massie takes full credit for the design of her room and its allwhite palette while ellen conducts organizing efforts without the permission of her aunt the drama of both novels scenes in which these inner sanctums are destroyed is enhanced by the implied contrast between the rooms before and after the destruction if the rooms are symbolic of both characters pureattested by the cleanliness and whiteness of each inner worlds the destruction of eachby fantastic design or forcebecomes a deflowering for both the attitudes both novels take toward this scene of destruction are similar as well following nancys visit ellen cries heartily  from nervous vexation and can be calmed only by the reading of hymns from a book a stranger had given her to direct her prayer from that sinful heart of hers  pp   massie too finds comfort in meditating on her fantasy we know that any real destruction of her room would be met with outrage in the same way claires visit to her room proved irritating massies bedroom like the home in domestic fiction is the terrain in which her spiritual and material desires are realized and embodied tompkins writes that the home in domestic fiction operates in these novels as a basis of religious faith that has unmistakably worldly dimensions  p  similarly massies room is the place where her luxurious and enviable wardrobe is stored where her physical growth is recorded and monitored in the form of her collection of mannequins and where she imagines her first romantic encounter tompkins draws from warners the wide wide world to illustrate the way in which the home was used to symbolize the promise of domesticity an extraordinary combination of sensual pleasures emotional fulfillment spiritual aspirations and satisfaction in work accomplished  pp  when ellen visits the home of mrs vawse a character whom tompkins judges has achieved the greatest spiritual victory  p  she is taken by vawses small but clean and white house tompkins calls mrs vawses home a symbol of spiritual purity and  physical beauty in which holiness and pleasure are combined and argues that the lesson ellen and the novels reader learns from mrs vawse is that piety and industry both activities over which a woman has control can set you free  p  although readers of the contemporary the clique series may not have the same massive designer wardrobe massie boasts they might look to massies example in terms of tidiness and orderliness and absorb the encouragement the series offers to readers to keep their sexualities firmly within the fantasy realm conclusions from the future the past a comparison of the themes found in the twentyfirstcentury popular series for girls the clique with the themes associated with midnineteenthcentury domestic fiction for girls reveals a striking number of similarities the lineage of both genresdomestic fiction for girls and chick lit for girls of which the clique is a partare similar as well both girls genres grew out of an established genre of writing for women and emerged in part as a result of the popularity of the adult genre among young reading audiences as representative works of chick lit for girls the clique series owes a debt to the domestic fiction tradition that informed the creation of the girls version of the genre as in domestic fiction the clique novels show an intense interest in class and its concomitant display while domestic fiction coded descriptions of class in terms of an idea of gentility the contemporary series uses a language of brand names to delineate the upper and middle classes the term domestic fiction evinces an interest in the domestic sphere and in relation to its valorization of what mcrobbie and garber call bedroom culture the clique pays similar attention to the home and a girls place in it the presence of these similar themes in fiction for girls written more than a century apart is especially noteworthy as are the comparable attitudes these excerpts convey relative to these themes the interest in gentility and the limitations of appropriate female behavior with particular regard to dress is present in the clique as well as in representative domestic fiction titles the examples drawn from what katy did which serve to delineate the acceptable ways in which women should adorn themselves and the fine line between tawdriness and prettiness reveal textual lessons similar to those taught by the clique in the clique the brands that are acceptable are made explicit however the mere consumption of these brands is not what determines a consumers ultimate fitness there is an art to the consumption and display of fashion the way in which a girl wears her clothing is as important as the clothes themselves this point is driven home in the clique installment entitled revenge of the wannabes in which massie and claire compete to design their schools new uniform when after a series of mishaps massie and claire find themselves on the same design team massie agrees to allow claires dreaded keds to be part of their proposed uniform although another team beats massie and claire by switching the ballot boxes in which students cast their votes for the best uniform we readers know that their uniformkeds includedwas the real winner that massie and her team were able to pull off their kedsinclusive uniform speaks to the contemporary idea of gentility that the clique series ultimately promotes furthermore the attitudes related to domesticity present in the clique are surprisingly similar to those encouraged in literature for girls of the nineteenth century as in the passage from what katy did examined above the clique describes the girls bedroom as her safe space in which she can literally try on different identities and fantasize about her future in massies room she fantasizes about sex hunter calls the nineteenthcentury girls room the staging area for her own calisthenics of selfdiscipline  p  in what katy did the titular characters sickroom becomes the arena for her transformation from a girl who tore her dress every day hated sewing and didnt care a button about being called good  p  to one who was called the heart of the house similarly massies room effects a significant conversion in the clique however massies room is both the sphere in which massie affects the most power and the passageway through which claire is allowed entrÃ©e into massies exclusive world it is only after claire moves into massies room that she becomes an official member of the pretty committee thus the space serves as a sanctuary of transformation for claire while the attention to consumerism that permeates the clique would seem on the surface to valorize the wealthy lifestyle associated with massie and her pretty committee the series ultimately congratulates the middle class in the same way in which domestic fiction for girls did the details of massies shopping expeditions and of her regular wardrobe changes form a particular and significant part of the series narrative however the glimpses we are allowed of massies unhappiness and concern with the maintenance of her social status reveal an insecure and less admirable character claire triumphs morally in each installment and is rewarded with both material goods and intangibles in the first book she finds a group of friends who dont care what she wears and she scores designer jeans from the school lostandfound in the second the pretty committee tries to embarrass her at a halloween party but her unorthodox costume ends up attracting the attention of massies crush as the established symbol of the middle class claire is the series primary heroine while one might argue that domestic fiction for both women and girls appeared as a means of constructing the female position within a world that was rapidly stratifying and in which a middle class was emerging from an industrial revolution perhaps the chick lit for girlsparticularly that chick lit known as privileged chick litappeared and continues to appear as a means of reexamining female subjectivity in an increasingly technological world in which class stratification is becoming even more layered while the clique seems to allow space for the female characters to consider their emerging sexualities the limits of sexual expression are made clear claire does eventually kiss the boy she likes however any further activity is discouraged both literally and symbolically the visiting cousin nina who boasts of her sexual experience is an attractive figure to all the girls except massie but when her true nature is revealed the girls alliances shift back to massie whose more explicit sexual thoughts remain fantasies and because the girls allegiance returns to massiewho deep down inside the narrative reveals is starving for more information that nina would be able to provide about the mysteries of sexmassie and the reader remains in a blissfully ignorant state as ninas secrets are never told this ignorant state is similar to that of the victorian focus on the mystique of sexuality rather than its mechanics as hunter writes  p  of this ignorance joan jacobs brumberg writes the ideal nineteenthcentury american girl was always naÃ¯veattractively soand she was untarnished by knowledge or even thoughts about what the victorians discreetly called the sexual connection  p  both massie and claire remain attractively naive throughout the series while the character who brags of her experience is unceremoniously shunned by the girls in an afterword to the  edition of what she calls the urtext of the nineteenthcentury united states the wide wide world tompkins writes that the role of ellen the novels main character is not so much the antithesis of the male heros traditional role in literature as a transformation of it  pp   it is this transformation of the heros role that allows a female figure to remain central in the text that makes warners novel both remarkable and influential tompkins compares ellens story to the pilgrims progress the long journey toward sainthood that imitates the male model of striving for worldly success  p  although ellen achieves success through a harsh selfdiscipline that would ultimately involve the quieting of any individual impulses beyond piety the placement of a woman at the center of such a narrative should be noted jo march of little women participates in a similar journey toward domesticity by finding that her ambition for fame and renown for fortune and comfort for gentility as well as for freedom can all be accommodated in the middleclass household  p  the only way to overcome what foote calls the structural or economic inequalities  p  that limit the march sisters abilities to be in the case of jo famous authors or in the case of amy famous artists a turn toward the domestic ideal is necessary this same story is told in what katy did as katy learns to temper her individuality and become the center of her own familys home in each novel the central character experiences tremendous and even painful losses through which she must suffer all of which serve to turn each heroine toward her natural place in the home similarly if each volume of the clique is read as one part of a greater whole each novels central conflict can be seen as a step forwardeffected by the heroines triumphant emergence from humiliation and strife wrought by peerson a journey toward a similar ideal the clique claire is on a pilgrims progress toward popularity and in the series popularity is signified by conformity to a certain brand of femininity how to balance her sense of herselfin the terms used by the little women of alcotts novelhow to maintain her castles in the air until these hidden stores of ours  lie open to the fathers sight  may they be rich in golden hours  deeds that show fairer for the light  p  the politics of recommendation historians have noted that when the wide wide world little women and what katy did emerged they quickly became best sellers however the critical reception of these stories has been historically varied similarly the novels that make up the clique have reached bestseller status in spite of their lukewarm reception by professional critics tompkins reports that when the wide wide world first appeared in  it caused a sensation in the literary marketplace no novel written in the united states had ever sold so well  critics praised it in the pages of the north american review the nation and the literary world  p  although as foster and simons write modern critics of warners novel have argued that the book articulates more radical or iconoclastic possibilities of female autonomy and empowerment than readers might initially believe nineteenthcentury readers accepted the fiction as an accurate picture of their own lives in many respects and also drew on it for social and spiritual guidance  pp   similarly little women was enormously popular upon its first publication in two volumes and clark argues this popularity reflects a certain institutionalization of alcott especially in schools and libraries  pp   nineteenthcentury literary critics were less interested in the novel however clark writes despite highbrow dismissals and scholarly silence critical activity with respect to alcott revived  then waned then waxed  and subsequently accelerated  p  what katy did too was considered less than rebellious when it was published and popularly received however macleod writes its readers today can hear the cry of outrage beneath the smooth and proper surface  p  these nineteenthcentury novels were welcomed by readers in the same way the serial installments of harrison the clique are anticipated and greeted by their twentyfirstcentury readers scholarly work related to the clique is all but absent perhaps this series too needs a century to excite the academic imagination in light of their similaritiesin lineage and themeto contemporary chick lit for girls the regarded place of little women the wide wide world and what katy did within academic and critical discourse stands in high contrast to the clique dubious position one might argue that contemporary criticisms of the clique are related to its writing style and its literary quality however the texts of both popular and professional critiques betray this claim the popular as well as the professional media express more concern for the novels as potential influencers of teen behavior and consumption than as works of popular literature when campbell argues for example that in the hands of more skilled and responsible writers than the clique author lisi harrison better contemporary chick lit has been produced the real critique seems to hinge on campbells assessment of the plots of the clique and its popular sisters that glorify shallow materialisma moral argument to be sure  p  school library journals reviews of the first and the third books in the series betray an attitude of disdain toward the series as a whole of the first book the reviewer diana pierce writes the cruelty of the clique is not redeemed with any sort of satisfying ending  p  of the third alice dinizo argues that the book is not for every collection and recommends other novels for notsowealthy and country teens  p  the young adult library associations placement of the first book in the series on the  list of quick picks for reluctant readers which writes the quick picks committee does not consider the literary quality of these books  an essential criterion  p  is another clue to the professional perception of the series as one that exists outside the literary canon these assessments which discount literariness and foreground an unspoken and even undefined idea of appropriateness are what ultimately inform the place of books like the clique novels in the critical and professional communities the professional and popular perception of the clique as a less than literary offering and thus as a conditional purchase or in the case of its placement on the quick picks list a means to change a reluctant reader into an avid reader brings the discussion of the series to a point at which what barbara herrnstein smith calls the contingency of value of any object must be considered smith writes that the nonutilitarian value of any work is in constant fluctuation because those influences that determine the worth of an objectour individual needs interests and resourcesare themselves functions of our continuously changing states in relation to an environment that may be relatively stable but is never absolutely fixed  p  in terms of this argument the individual needs interests and resources of any reader of the clique combined with his or her place in history and the environment will determine how he or she values or doesn value the series the critiques of the series above come from a somewhat homogeneous population first the readers and writers of such critiques are adults all of those quoted above are women and the majority of them have relationships to libraries and youth services the young readers and fans of the series likely occupy a different demographic and are probably in the majority teenage or tweenage girls and may or may not have relationships to libraries as patrons smith argues that the different assessments of the value of a common objectin this case the young readers versus the professional adults assessment of the cliquederive from the same impulses the issue of which groups values are accepted within the dominant culture is one of power the values espoused by the more powerful group become the accepted values libraries librarians and critics of young peoples literature have a distinctly powerful position in this system of contingent values in fact the history of library service is predicated on this position of library power lundin writes that the early librarys ambitious mission was to shape a communitys thinking  p  the librarys selection of materials predicated on the idea of the power of books for good or ill and the necessity for guidance  p  constitutes the primary means for the library to achieve this goal where services for children are concerned the childrens librarian and selector of materials for children finds himself or herself in a position of power to influence the concept of literary value among a distinctly less powerful subset of the community children what material is valued and what material is not is contingent not only on a dominant idea of literary value broadly construed but also on the belief in the power that the book may exert on the especially vulnerable child as well as on the significantly greater capacity for an adult to choose appropriate material for that child in lillian smiths the unreluctant years a book considered to be among the first of its kind in its focus on the criticism and selection of childrens fiction the author explains the importance of a quality childhood diet of reading childhood is the impressionable and formative period so receptive and so brief that a child has less need of and less time for the mediocre than an adult  p  because childhood is such a transitory but formative period smith argues it is especially important that those in that stage waste no time with reading material not considered worthwhile by critics librarians charged with selecting literature for young people have historically taken this statement as the veiled warning that it is if we read smiths words as a prediction of the dire consequences of inappropriate reading during a short crucial period the issue of literary selection becomes one fraught with anxiety the place of massproduced and popular fiction in a librarys young adult collection has been historically contested as libraries and librarians consider the wealth of material available for purchase in terms of their often slender budgets and in competing terms with the anxious process of selection library selection policies are written to check any uncertainty and are meant to ensure the purchase of material that meets the curricular and extracurricular interests of the population however as lundin notes in a historical account of the selection standards set by librarians libraries serve as the genteel setting in dee garrisons words for the promotion and arbitration of morals and manners through a defined print culture what a library collects is a microcosm of valued and validated literature  p  that is by recognizing its position as a powerful subject in the arena of contingent values the library ensures that any material it collects will be considered valuable if only because the library collected it as an institution with a vested interest in the maintenance of its own authority the library is thus in smiths terms called upon repeatedly to devise arguments and procedures that validate the communitys established tastes and preferences thereby warding off barbarism and the constant apparition of an imminent collapse of standards and also justifying the exercise of its own normative authority  p  in the course of this process public librarians generated a rhetoric of guidance that created and helped maintain a dichotomy between different types of fiction and reading between what has variably been labeled popular  and  elite  p  ultimately the placement of the clique in the category of the popular and the criticism of it in terms of what some might argue are its dubious influences do little to authorize the value judgments made by the young readers of the series while it is unlikely that every young person who reads the clique becomes a series devotee the power of the readers who do enjoy harrisons series is evident and exemplified by its bestseller status these readers are not the passive recipients of the text that critics might fear them to be and an examination of harrisons web site devoted to the clique offers proof of this claim here readers participate in message boards read letters written to the author that are featured in harrisons letter of the month column and even submit corrections to the site when they discover continuity errors including grammatical errors in the text of the novels in this way these vocal readers are doing the same things foster and simons set out to do in their critical monograph of girls fiction namely to explode the fallacy of rejection as futile in any serious critical consideration of such material as that written for girls  p xiii foster and simonss positions as academics the publication of their work by an academic press and their access to critical and historical resources to support their arguments grant them a more powerful ground from which to challenge historical contingencies of value why should we have to wait for the young readers of the clique to reach or not similar pinnacles before we listen to their critical voices
