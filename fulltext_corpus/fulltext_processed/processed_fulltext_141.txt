journal of education for librarianship for those who become enamoured of the spanking new and different terminology many in the expectation of kudos in the shape of salary and prestige and for those persuaded or frightened by the apostles of the machine that librarians are on the way out the logical next step was to become documentalists or information specialists or literature scientists just as janitors had become maintenance personnel undertakers mortuary artists and plumbers sanitary engineers before we allow the formidable combination of panic the hard sell of the hardware suppliers and the desire to keep up with the joneses if not one step ahead of them  to change the character of our profession a long hard look at the situation is in order in defense of diversity during a luncheon meeting which followed recruiting interviews for library trainees a bright young counselor asked me whether the current emphasis on machine techniques would bring about the appearance of a new kind of librarian i am sure i surprised him by the fervency with which i uttered i hope not one of the many satisfying elements in our profession has been its capacity to offer fulfillment to all kinds of people providing of course they had the ability to do professional work  those who have loved books  the feel of them the smell of them the way theye printed even the idea of them  better than they do people have gone into technical services those who prefer to work with people directly have gone into public services there is a place too for those who are interested in developing systems which involve the use of high speed printers cards falling into slots or unseen hands typing    and i am happy to welcome them but i do not feel that what they are doing is more important or more significant than what has been done in libraries since clay tablets were collected in mesopotamia information specialists have a tendency to feel that they alone are ready for the library of the future but so are those of us whose work brings us into contact with no machine more complicated than the typewriter the newest wrap around technique which makes possible current awareness among chemical titles does not bring greater satisfaction to a patron interested in normal stress effects in second order fluids than does a traditionally made index which leads an inquirer to a beloved poem from a dimly remembered fragment 
a different drummer thoughts on library education there is room in the profession for all kinds of librarians but i would give short shrift to the arrogant assumption that this is the century of gadgets and that the librarian who does not surrender himself to the machine is an anachronism the century in which wassily kandinsky flourished also nurtured an andrew wyeth aaron copland music is contemporaneous with the sounds produced by john cage james joyce and john galsworthy are both products of the same era change for change sake there is a school of thought which considers all change to be improvement to the worshippers at such a shrine nothing is good unless it is the latest however shoddy however inapplicable to a given situation when i visited libraryusa at the new york world fair i was appalled to see what passed for an information center no one was answering unplanned reference questions no one was talking about books or libraries or librarianship amid shouting suitable to any push a button and see it light up show librarians were grinding out printouts if i were a possible recruit i would have found the field as tempting as tending an endless belt in a factory or wrapping parcels in a supermarket it was not the use of devices  the children theatre part of the same exhibit used devices too  slides films tape recordings  but the exhibitors had had the grace to recognize them as secondary the focus of attention was a librarian not a computer the idea of change for change sake coupled with the equally crippling blind following of the trend has always resulted in grotesques whether the field is librarianship or architecture and indeed blind following in the case of the latter has dotted the american landscape with library after library that is distinguished only for windows windows windows with no regard for the differences posed by climate or terrain in the case of the former it has resulted in the use of complicated or expensive or space wasting machines where they make no discernible sense the frenzied desire to change just to be changing is sad but it is not new in a  issue of library journal melvil dewey complains that some librarians seem to feel toward their catalog rules as they do toward their clothes that they are liable to be commented on unpleasantly unless 
journal of education for librarianship they have something new each season whenever a few come together there is the tendency to propose alterations with the same freedom that they would try experiments in other directions forgetting that the card catalog is the worst place in the world to make new changes because new work is inserted at irregular places destroying consistency and harmony and reflecting unpleasantly on the ability of those who have done the work    special training for special librarians among the dangers that confront the profession a persistent one is that of fragmentation of preparation this danger is inherent in the continued insistence of some special librarians that the library schools re arrange the entire curriculum in line with their needs they ask for a curriculum which will prepare them for the kind of library in which they are to work and which excuses them from presently required courses which are valuable primarily for school and public libraries this is absurd as well as short sighted just as a city is a congeries of villages so every library except the smallest is a series of special libraries as lawrence clark powell said in an address given before the nd annual convention of the special libraries association on may   although i have worked most of my life in a university library system it is a varied one embracing law medicine engineering chemistry physics education art music theatre arts and industrial relations and business administration and i could claim to be a special librarian  besides even were it true which it seldom is that a librarian to be knows in advance exactly what kind of library he wants to work in what guarantee is there that a job in such a library would be waiting for him on graduation or that he might not want to make a change i make a point of reading personal progress notes in the newsletter published by the new york chapter of the sla and i am wryly amused to note both the frequency of change and the radical difference in the type of library the librarian moves from and to  from a job with an oil company to one with a public relations firm from a college library to a public library from an art library to an insurance library could a narrowly based curriculum suitable only for an industrial library have carried over to a college library paul woodring in a saturday review editorial  on the future of liberal education says specialized or technical training prepares an individual for his first job but not for the decisions he must make as a free man or for the changes in careers that will come during his 
a different drummer thoughts on library education lifetime liberal education because it is education for versatility is the best preparation for those who live in a changing world so it is with preparation for librarianship in a special library or a public library in a school or a college the basic library curriculum is deliberately left general elastic and liberal so that it will prepare not only for the first job but for all of them one of the best statements i have seen regarding this nagging insistence on a myriad of special courses was the one made by harold lancour when he was the associate director of the university of illinois library school in response to a letter asking what special courses were available at illinois  we believe that the principal distinction between types of libraries has to do with the book collection and the purposes of the readers we are also convinced that knowledge concerning specialized subjects is not gained in library school but must be based on study which either precedes or follows library training these are the reasons then why one does not customarily find a course in special libraries under such a title in the current library school catalogs nevertheless we insist that we prepare for special librarianship at illinois in all of our courses it is possible for a student to exploit any specific interest to a very considerable extent in our administration course which is a general one the student specifically interested in music librarianship for example can do all of his projects in that course with the music library in mind     we also have a special projects course called advanced studies in librarianship in which a student may under close direction carry out a detailed investigation of a problem in special libraries in general or in even more specialized areas such as art and architecture agriculture chemistry physics law music etc these problems can be either bibliographical or administrative thus you see while we do not have a course ow to be a special librarian we have a rich group of offerings which permit highly specialized development of a particular interest all of which must be based however on a strong general training in librarianship not only do people shift from one kind of library to another sometimes a whole library shifts from one pattern to another my own library used to be arranged on the traditional pattern by form of material when we got our new building we switched to a divisional 
journal of education for librarianship set up overnight our general reference staff was scattered throughout the library and our reference librarians became subject specialists how did it work out fabulously since science seems to be the subject about which there is most concern i asked our new science librarian who had majored in history how she was faring and she assured me that her experience as a general reference librarian had been the best possible preparation for her new assignment she feels strongly that the science librarian who knows humanities and social science reference tools can do a better job as a result these examples illustrate the point  mathematics and music librarian has to know about scholes and other reference books in music as well as physics abstracts and the journal of the acoustical society of america  mixed marriage librarian has to know of sociological abstracts and international index as well as of psychological abstracts  hostility in children librarian has to know of winn encyclopedia of child guidance and child development abstracts as well as of education index and psychological abstracts  child life in israel librarian has to know of sociological abstracts education index yearbooks issued by the israeli government as well as of psychological abstracts the perhaps strange but wonderful fact is that intelligent and interested librarians seem to be able to function well in highly specialized situations regardless of their major when i say interested i mean that they will be willing to re tool for a new job by taking a course in the bibliography of the subject if that seems desirable or by learning on the job through a total immersion in it the experience of the documentation center connected with the school of library science at western reserve university in training abstracters for work with papers in metallurgy is very significant there was no special study made of this phenomenon but it was the impression of the supervisory people that non specialists in metallurgy especially arts and science trained people tended to produce more satisfactory abstracts of the particular short indicative kind wanted than did the specialists who were inclined to argue with the authors editorialize about authors statements etc  and what could be more special than metallurgy the purpose of the special librarian is much better served by the practice followed by all the library school deans i know when they

journal of education for librarianship not only are doubts about the current superiority of machine retrieval a very expensive installation being expressed by authorities like ralph shaw and yehoshua bar hillel there is grave doubt that improved computer equipment will improve the situation i will cheerfully grant that in some highly selective and specialized fields machine searching will probably work very well but even if it does who wants all that information it cannot be denied that an urgency exists in scientific technological research and that this has greatly affected the demands placed upon the special library the amount of research the number of scientists and the volume of publication has increased the extent of this has been adequately documented elsewhere yet the volume of publication is deceptive the desirability of supplying all the available information and the assumption that more and more information is better than less and less is based upon a fallacy the inescapable truth remains that most people have too much and not too little information the difficulty is not so much storage and retrieval as evaluation and interpretation much of the available information is meaningless inaccurate or irrelevant its relationship to research and the problem at hand is often far from explicit the contexts frames of reference and configurations of concepts cannot be readily formed which would give significance and structure to raw information the provision of additional information often serves to cause further confusion and to impede the structuring process quite understandably a microbiologist recently remarked f all of human knowledge could be put on a computer and i could push a button and get all the information on dna i doubt that i would ever push that button  fortunately for the human race it is still true that people poor fallible things that they are have something that can never be built into a machine moreover there are certain kinds of retrieval that a human reference librarian can perform that no known machine can this is retrieval based not on objective factors but on associative recall a wholly subjective process as one information retrieval specialist has explained it he machine may be able to get me a copy of shannon and weaver on the mathematical theory of communication if i ask for it and describe it correctly but it cannot if i mis identify it yet i can ask a librarian for a copy of that red book by shannon on information theory and somehow through a process of association she will remember that it is in fact an orange book and that it is the one that has been circulated a lot recently to faculty members in the math department and that its title is not what i said she can find it for me despite

journal of education for librarianship i sure few would deny that every effort should be made to provide readers with those services judged essential by the profession regardless of costs or techniques but what constitutes ssential a computerized system can provide us with an astonishing array of lists and statistics as by products of the system but we must not lose sight of the crucial question of whether patrons and administrators really want or need this information an automated ordering system can also provide the library with data on the status of outstanding book orders particularly orders which have been delayed to perform this job manually is no small task it means that all status reports received from publishers must be posted in the outstanding order file nevertheless the cost might very well be justified if this represents a type of information our patrons require however just because a computerized system can provide us with this data as a by product this does not make it an essential service why do a job efficiently that does not need to be done at all   i am highly irritated by the substitution of expensive alternatives for the printed page which fail to live up to the promises made for them    microreproduction techniques are not a panacea for the problem of sprawling collections first the need for a machine of some kind to enlarge the image means that users do not have the physical freedom that book users enjoy the council on library resources is supporting studies aimed at developing a simple light weight and effective pocket reader  an enlarging lens and bracket of some kind that readers can carry with them anywhere but there are a number of prickly optical problems to be solved before this can be accomplished secondly many readers especially researchers need the convenience of a book study through a reading enlarger makes it difficult to flip through pages to scan or to browse for material the machines often must be used in subdued light in his charming thoughts on books and libraries  edwin wolf ii discloses a number of well kept secrets about book magazine and disc substitutes which should give pause to those librarians who are busy throwing away the originals i cannot accept microfilms or microcards or magnetic tapes as a substitute for the original as expedients for the inexpensive transmission of texts from a library to a scholar desk miles apart for circumscribed use these gadgets of reproduction are wonderful but we are being assailed by a barrage of hard salesmanship which tells us not to bother about the expense of the
