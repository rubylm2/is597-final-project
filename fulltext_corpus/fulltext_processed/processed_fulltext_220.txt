continuing education patricia senn breivik editor one of the basic needs in the area of continuing education for the library and information science profession is for an effective nationwide communication system so that concerned individuals and institutes can benefit from and build upon the experience of others to this end jel is particularly happy to welcome edwin s  gleaves director programs for educational support personnel george peabody college for teachers nashville tennessee as the first guest columnist to share his experiences and insights on the topic    peabody perspectives in library science an experiment in continuing education on august   the following memorandum was presented to the faculty and student representatives of the school of library science peabody perspectives in library science a modest proposal the idea a series of in service seminarsworkshops for librarians and students noncredit dealing with areas of major concern in librarianship today the format one or two lengthy sessions per month on a given topic perhaps on the first and third mondays of a given month the first session devoted to presentation of the material by an authority in the field be he a peabody faculty member or a visiting speaker and the second devoted to a specific follow up geared toward implementation of the ideas presented  perhaps with specific proposals such as were drawn up at the institute on interlibrary cooperation at peabody the state plan for library services responsibility to be sponsored by the school of library science perhaps in cooperation with the mid state library association andor the nashville library club different faculty members would be responsible for the planning and organization of each series of seminars working with a committee of two or three practicing librarians knowledgeable and interested in the subject this steering committee could make previous contact with the appropriate people for the content of the seminars themselves

librarians educators  served as speakers or discussion leaders in these workshops as the first year drew to an end we became convinced that the workshop series although an added responsibility for several members of the faculty should be continued thus for   workshops were offered on the following topics puppets on parade october  public and community relations for librarians november  cable television and libraries february  and intellectual freedom and censorship march sponsored in cooperation with the tennessee library association and the mid state library association for the three workshops held on the peabody campus revenues were sufficient enough to begin to plan for a new series for   and moreover to appoint a part time coordinator of the series who is responsible for consulting with all interested persons developing plans for the workshop producing materials for mailing and in general providing information on the workshops the coordinator for  is ruth crispin an advanced graduate student who has had considerable experience in children work plans for   include a minidemonstration workshop on creative story telling for area teachers offered in cooperation with the metropolitan nashville board of education an off campus offering in the clarksvillefort campbell area on the topic of current events and reading for the continuing education busy librarian to be offered in cooperation with zibart bookstore in nashville enhancing the use of the library media center in the instructional program and race relations for librarians to be designed by minority students on title ii b fellowships in cooperation with the race relations center in nashville as of this writing one or two more workshops are planned on reference networks for academic and public libraries and international intercultural children literature other topics which are being considered for the indefinite future are microform technology government documents archival management and special services to children this workshop series has not been without its problems perhaps the most nagging one being the lack of financial support from the institution and the obvious difficulty of asking professors to add this activity to a full teaching load  although it should be said that many of the faculty have cooperated fully and enthusiastically the appointment of a part time coordinator and the present likelihood of the college assuming some support has brightened the picture considerably community response has in general been gratifying although a number of area teachers and school librariansmedia specialists have probably attended more out of concern for acquiring profession development points than out of pure love of learning or self improvement still the best 
journal of education for librarianship response by far has come from the school community and from public libraries academic librarians with some notable exceptions have not responded as well as we had hoped such workshops as puppets on parade and cable television and libraries drew very well as we expected but public and community relations for librarians for which we had received many requests if not demands over the years was not attended getting the notices to the appropriate people on all of these workshops has not been an easy matter because one mailing list has never sufficed to reach the variety of persons for whom these various workshops are designed one thing has become obvious to us in planning such offerings in continuing education the cooperation of practitioners is essential thus from the advisory committee itself to the leaders of the various workshops we have relied heavily upon the willingness of persons in the community to share their experiences with their colleagues the guidance of practitioners in planning for the workshop series has been of course indispensable although most offerings thus far have been on campus we foresee more offcampus offerings in the future as well as a greater variety of formats although the format of two evening sessions per month has worked out quite well special efforts will also be made to attract more members of the academic community the column editor invites other comments from library schools professional organizations and libraries as to programs of continuing education or related information which will be of value to others involved with such efforts comments should be sent directly to pratt institute graduate school of library and information science brooklyn new york
