the burning of books frances e hammitt in our present society books are not often burned as a sign of condemnation although they may be censored or suppressed the idea of burning books however still exists hitler book fire of may io i shocked most people but the notion of the device still lingers in social thought and bursts out in occasional manifestations the threat of a mayor of chicago to burn books which contradicted certain ideas of history the proposals made by a governor of georgia for the burning of books concerning the betterment of race relations and the actual burning orders in missouri and ohio of books which were distasteful in language or content most of the literature concerning book burning considers its chronological history in different countries sometimes the chronological treatment is combined into a division by types of books so destroyed such methods enable an author to relate the causes circumstances and effects of each case since every bobk is to some degree unique the burning of individual books is logically considered as a series of separate events other works which contain material on the burning of books treat the subject incidentally in connection with discussions of censorship intellectual history or the development of certain types of thought practices and social institutions this paper attempts neither approach its purpose has been only to gather material on a few of the general aspects of the history of book burning its aim is neither inclusiveness nor specialization it might almost be considered a series of introductions since the discussion is limited to cases in which books were actually burned it is only indirectly concerned with the broader subject of censorship of literary productions the first section takes up the societal backgrounds of the practice of book burning the second discusses those who sponsored or directed the burning the third relates some of the attempts at total eradication of books or literatures and the last section is a general consideration of effects the backgrounds of book burning destruction of books by fire is only one aspect of the long history of censorship it is also one aspect of the efforts of society from immemorial time to destroy by fire the persons who challenge its authority or the ideas which contradict its existing customs and beliefs social groups have always been intolerant or resentful toward the nonconformist sociologists and anthropologists have attributed this characteristic to the establishment and sanctification of primitive mores and institutions and to the existence of an underlying fear that deviation from tradition will anger spiritual powers and menace the safety of the group herd instinct enforces conformity the possible alteration and consequent destruction of the social order seems implied in any change as one nobleman has said any change of any kind at any time is bad the particular nonconformisms which i e p cheyney freedom and restraint a short history annals of the american academv cc november i i 
the burning of books i are most severely punished vary with the particular society the most definite action is taken in fields in which mass feeling is strongest or in which group interests are most distinctly evident men tend to punish most severely those who contravene the beliefs or institutions about which they feel most deeply they are more likely to tolerate divergent opinion on subjects which do not touch their profoundest convctions therefore a list of the books suppressed or destroyed in any era may to some extent indicate the subjects upon which society or its ruling group felt most strongly at that time in such a list one may in a sense trace the intellectual and spiritual trend of a civilization in our society the books we censor or censure in lieu of burning are in general those which are considered offenses against sexual morals or taste and more rarely those which tend rather directly to attack established governmental order and theories throughout previous centuries in the western world there are comparatively few examples of censorship or destruction for offenses against taste and morals the great majority suffered because of existing restrictions against speculative thought and for opinions contrary to orthodox theology or established political power it is difficult however to determine the logic upon which it was decided whether individual books were to be suppressed expurgated forbidden or burned the distinctions defy classification the probability is that the particular circumstances events and authority affected the decision rather than any judgment of innate quality or measurement of depth of feeling the type of book sought most diligently for burning varied with the society and the authority both tended to suppress most rigorously the opinions which tended to undermine their powers or to challenge their anderlying philosophies the roster of the types of books burned is ecumenical in its inclusions almost every branch of written intellectual production appears in it and those in all walks of life are authors fire has always been one of the effective arguments directed against men their works and their products of thought its use against nonconformists heretics and criminals as well as against enemies is a practice which has existed usually with legal sanction for many ages fire may be used for the purpose of actual destruction or merely to symbolize abhorrence primitive societies were accustomed to burning images indeed the practice of burning enemies in effigy still continues the burning of obnoxious edicts or proclamations has been a common reaction throughout history immemorially the burning of either a representation of a detested person or his written name has been a device for venting animosity rituals for exorcism often included the burning of a picture of the demon by whom the patient was presumably possessed the use of fire as a weapon against books is a reasonable transfer from the custom of burning objects or persons who inspired abhorrence or fear since books like men are vehicles for the communication of thought implicit in the custom is the recognition of the possible effect of books and a fear of them which is almost as old as written literature the final arbiter of censorship is the opinion of the popular majority in the last analysis the continuing success of a  the case of peter dsma in the fifteenth century presents an interesting variation of this type of burning when his book treatise on confession was sent to the fire his chair was burned with it
 the library quarterly program of censorship rests upon the willingness or acquiescence of the people apparently most of the book burnings had popular approval the populace in the main shared the detestation with which certain types of writings were regarded and supported the burning of books containing ideas that were feared and detested for example a general accord was evident concerning the necessity of exterminating heresy and the imperative duty to maintain rightful secular authority the difficulties lay in the differing interpretations of what was heresy and what was rightful authority evidences of popular protests and attempted prevention of the execution of orders are seen when the group in power endeavored to continue the persecution of theories and ideas which were beginning to receive mass acceptance and which were no longer objects of censure to the bulk of society two general kinds of book burning have occurred the history of the world contains many examples of the eradication of great groups of books and collections and of attempts to wipe out entire literatures such wholesale destruction has been due either to deliberate efforts or to the havoc incidental to war and invasion the second type of fiery war against books has been directed against individual books such actions have been either destructive or symbolic in their purposes in the first case as in the deliberate eradications of entire types of literatures an attempt has been made to destroy all copies of a particular book the invention of printing however made it almost impossible to secure all copies and many burnings were admittedly symbolic book burning as a general custom died out in europe near the end of the eighteenth century toward the close of an era which had seen the rise of science a struggle against the irrational and superstitious in doctrines and the growth of a belief in reason as the highest authority and in the concept of the natural rights of man as these ideas attained general acceptance the custom of book burning declined along with belief in witchcraft extreme restrictions on the press and the unquestioning acceptance of authority and absolute truth the book burners fire is a simple and direct answer to contradictory opinion books have sometimes been burned by individuals or by undirected mobs in general however the burning of books was carried out under the same auspices asorganized censorship by the churches by those in political authority either the sovereign or the legislature and by the universities these institutions and their motives for the burning of books were often intertwined and intersupporting especially when the church and the state were themselves politically interwoven the recognized political authority often delegated the duty of censorship and destruction to the church or to the universities conversely sometimes the church left the enforcement of its decrees to the secular authorities the latter was the practice of most of the protestant churches they usually had no such power over civil affairs as did the roman catholic church and no such weapon as excommunication with which to implement their decrees the motives behind the burnings were also often intermingled most of the edicts were issued on political and theological grounds the church often had a deep interest in maintaining existent political theories as well as religious orthodoxy the secular authorities had a similar desire to enforce the authority of the
the burning of books  church over the people and to prevent speculation on religious thought also it was often felt that the duty of the legislature lay as much in the preservation of men souls from heresy as in the maintenance of established government or the guardianship of civil and legal rights consequently the border line between the church and religious zeal on the one hand and political authority and secular motives on the other is extremely indistinct for this reason the roman catholic church looms large in the history of bookburning through the centuries its legal status as the sole established religion identified it with the state condemnations were sometimes made by papal decree more often by the indexes of the church these indexes were usually authorized by various councils of the church and prepared by special boards individual ones were also published by the theological faculties of european universities it was the practice to destroyusually by fire books which were condemned by decree or by inclusion on the indexes political motives and personal rivalries are evident in some of the church condemnations but much of the destruction was motivated by a real desire to save men souls by preventing the reading of material which might shake their faith and so lead to heresy and damnation in some instances the church not only burned books and perhaps their authorsbut immediately prepared and published refutations of the heretical arguments and charges contained in the condemned books in the english church the archbishops and other prominent churchmen often received from the political authority the power to censor and condemn books german princes similarly often delegated authority to churchmen while the sovereign power of censorship was sometimes thus delegated to church authorities he frequently chose to exercise this power himself this is particularly true in the case of attempts at mass destruction of literature motives for personal decrees were manifold opinions had been distasteful to the sovereign for various reasons many condemnations were directed by petty animus some works were condemned because of personal predispositions some from religious conviction many from a fear that the principles expressed would weaken the sovereign position or prerogatives parliaments and other state legislative bodies often wielded power over books either by delegation or by their own authority in old rome during the republic and the empire the burning of books was a function of the senate the praetors were charged with the execution of the decrees the burnings usually took place in the forum in france the parkment which in the early years of its existence was however more a judicial than a legislative body often allowed the church and the sorbonne to supervise books especially in theological matters it usually enforced church decisions by state decree nevertheless on occasion it passed condemnations on its own initiative  punishment was in some cases confined to the book itself however often both church and secular authorities decreed to the author fine imprisonment mutilation or death sometimes the publisher printer and bookseller and occasionally the official licenser were included in the sentences  j a farrer books condemned to be burnt new york a c armstrong  son  p  s the parlement always claimed to have the final authority over books and condemnation even if it did not exercise it directly see g h putnam books and their makers during ike middle ages new york g p putnam sons i ii 
 the library quarterly the english parliaments wielded great power over books and burned a number of them considerable information is available concerning their procedures and motives their condemnations of detestation were passed directly by parliamentary decree or by the establishment of such bodies as the star chamber the high commission or the stationers company all of these at times had power to seize and burn books beginning with the long parliament after i the matter was almost always determined by parliamentary decree the house of commons was usually the chief book burning authority at times the house of lords decided to condemn to the fire some letter or literary production found offensive to it or to one of its members sometimes both houses concurred in such decrees for a time a committee of the commons was itself given wide powers to seize and burn publications since resolutions in either house were subject to vote and the decision was often one of personal feeling or party politics many condemnations were decreed by close margins obviously changes in the controlling political party led to reversals of opinion many symbolic burnings were decreed for the acts or messages of previous parliaments attacks on individual members of parliament were likely to be punished by burning the offending document and it has been remarked that parliamentary feelings were easily injured books or pamphlets considered destructive of parliamentary liberties were almost certain to be sent to the fire parliamentary decrees were more temporary than those of the church or even of the sovereign changeableness and inconsistency are more evident and it may justifiably be said that policies were more factional and that personal spites and grievances were given more opportunity for expression a third institution concerned with book burning is the university whatever the contributions to civilization and to knowledge made by the universities their role in the history of censorship is a major one intertwined and interrelated with both political and theological organizations they were subject to pressure from both sometimes the universities were responsive to the opinions of different societal groups and sometimes they were a haven for dissenting thinkers in general however they seem to have been much more responsive to constituted authority and to major groups than to rebellious or divergent opinions the role of the universities as censors developed historically from their social and economic situations and from their theological and secular ties almost from their inception on the continent the theological faculties of the universities were extremely influential and often exercised a kind of theological dictatorship they assisted in the preparation of church indexes of prohibited books and often prepared their own indexes or condemnations some universities received papal authority to impose penalties for the printing and reading of heretical  c r gillett burned books new york columbia university press  ii   rashdall says that in the twelfth to fourteenth centuries the university of paris was a channel through which the court addressed the nation and through which popular opinion was relayed to the sovereign hastings rashdall the universities of europe in the middle ages new ed oxford clarendon press i i    as early as  the masters of the university of paris participated in a synod at paris which condemned certain books to the fire ibid p  in the papal index published in  the theological faculties of all europe were consulted

the library quarterly responsible for so much destruction as has sometimes been indicated although it is true that great libraries and collections have been destroyed a few of the books often found their way to other places many rare manuscripts now held in our libraries and museums have had a long history of world wandering books were sometimes removed to other libraries sometimes they came into the possession of private owners in wars while fire has destroyed thousands of volumes valuable portions of collections have often been taken to enlarge the libraries of the invaders during the years when barbarian tribes overran italy many books were taken to constantinople where they were preserved and copied in the eastern monasteries in turn many books from the east later found their way back into western europe when constantinople underwent successive invasions tradition says that during the dark ages many books were preserved in britain and ireland during the days of the inquisition copies of condemned books were included in the collection kept by spanish kings in the escorial in the time of the destruction of the monasteries in sixteenth century england henry viii gave john leland the antiquarian permission to rescue from destruction such books as dealt with events of english history in china the early orders for the destruction of books were thwarted by a few scholars who concealed some of the old confucian tablets and other writings during the eighteenth century mass destruction in that country copies of condemned books were in some measure acquired by japanese korean and french libraries it has been noted that especially after the invention of printing total destruction of individual books was rarely possible in most cases at least a few copies survived and as long as even one copy of a book remained it was a potential factor in the development of thought in some instances condemnation really served to stress the importance of a book or a theory those which otherwise might have escaped popular notice were thus called to the attention of a wider reading public condemnation was probably a contributory factor in the wide and rapid spread of luther work and influence the papal decree for the burning of luther effigy and his books in  is  some of the great collections of poland thus found their way into the imperial libraries of russia the huge holdings in the present libraries in moscow and leningrad are due in great measure to the confiscation of private libraries during the revolution in the present century similarly many of the books taken from the libraries of the nobles who were guillotined or who emigrated during the french revolution were placed in the national library in paris  thompson questions the accuracy of the statement op cit pp    preserved smith a history of modern ciuture vol i the great renewal new york h holt  co  p   regrettably leland had only partial success besides those he rescued however a few others survived and found their way into college libraries and into private collections wu says that the destruction under chn shih huang was not so great as is generally supposed in addition to those who defied the decree certain officials were allowed to retain books and the emperor had his own collection he comments however that many of the books thus preserved were destroyed when hsiang yu fired the capitol in  bc and says that more damage was caused by this fire than by the proscription op cit pp   s goodrich op cit p   mathew tyndale is quoted to this effect regarding the burning by the grand jury of middlesex of his essay entitled rights of the christian church g h putnam the censorship of the church of rome new york g p putnam sons  ii
