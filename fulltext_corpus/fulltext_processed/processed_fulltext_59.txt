 the library quarterly background and literature review lesbigay concerns in librarianship while the public library inquiry found in  that public librarians were middle class individuals with conservative to moderate social views  since the social upheavals of the s the belief has persisted within the profession that a sizable portion of its members are politically democratic and socially liberal  pp   this view is seemingly reinforced by what now appears to have been intense civil rights activism in the areas of racism feminism and homosexuality in the early s  yet in reality american library association ala leadership and library educators have rarely championed the rights of lesbigay clients or colleagues and the profession is far more ambiguous on social issues than its democratic philosophy would lead one to believe martha boaz for example former dean of the library school at the university of southern california wrote in   that gays and lesbians should be excluded from the social responsibility credo of librarians and her sentiments have been echoed in recent years in letters printed in the reader forum column of american libraries following publication of a cover photograph of lesbigay librarians marching in the  san francisco gay pride day parade for example   cover ironically ala was the first professional organization to form a task force to address gay concerns now called the gay lesbian and bisexual task force or glbtf which has been in part responsible for the promotion and growth of a market in lesbigay literature through such annual recognitions as the gay and lesbian book award   sv libraries and archives by wayne r dynes at the same time discussion of lesbigay issues has been confined to programs of the glbtf only one or two general studies to date have queried librarians on gay  there is no consensus on the proper terminology for nonheterosexual persons or agreement on what homosexuality is even within the lesbigay community gay now usually applies to male homosexuals and lesbians to female homosexual persons however some homosexuals in seeking to empower themselves have reclaimed the labels used to demean them over the years fag dyke and queer while some people prefer the generic gay to apply to all nonheterosexuals lesbigay is a concise portmanteau word that incorporates bisexuals with gays and lesbians this term is used throughout this article except when speaking of gays lesbians or bisexuals specifically a practice that seems warranted by the adoption of the name gay lesbian and bisexual task force for the professional task force within the american library association in   formed as the task force on gay liberation in  shortly thereafter the gay task force the name of the group was changed to the gay and lesbian task force in  and to the gay lesbian and bisexual task force in 
the last socially acceptable prejudice  issues and virtually nothing has been written on lesbian or bisexual librarians concerns  does not discuss lesbian librarians  and  are rare examples lt is fairly easy to ascertain that the partitioning of lesbigay issues from acceptable social responsibility charges to the category of special interests has been consistent over the years since the social responsibilities roundtable is only a year older than glbtf and is in fact the parent organization of glbtf at the same time it is hardly accidental that glbtf had to petition council for six years before ala would sponsor the gay and lesbian book award first awarded by ala in   p  as polly thistlethwaite surmises the history of lesbigay librarians in the united states is still largely hidden  sv gays and lesbians in library history by polly thistlethwaite by way of contrast in new zealand where homosexuality has been decriminalized throughout the country and the national gay archives are housed in the national library phil parkinson  has provided notable examples of probably gay nineteenth century bibliophiles who served the british empire with distinction thus even while changing perceptions of sexual orientation frustrate attempts to understand it historically pioneering efforts such as parkinson provide professional role models for gay and straight librarians examples of lesbigay librarian role models are simply not available to american lesbigays especially since american library biography is largely male oriented asexual and two dimensional a notable exception is  see  for discussion of problems lesbigay history is silenced by social taboos and by the overprotective efforts of surviving relatives and friends to protect the reputation of self documenting lesbigays or to save themselves future embarrassment by destroying lesbigay letters diaries and memorabilia  librarianship as a service profession in which women have constituted from  to  percent of the workers since  has remained curiously impervious to general and dispassionate discussion of gender issues and particularly lesbigay issues other feminized service professions such as nursing and teaching have been quick to recognize the relationship between homophobia and the general complex of gender problems in the workplace    but librarianship has tended to relegate philosophical discussion of lesbigay issues which it equates with political issues to alternate library literature the exception to this rule is a small corpus of popular library literature concerning lesbigay clients lesbigay literature and bibliographic concerns such as pejorative bias in subject headings for example only     pp    a profession that supports such documents as the freedom to read statement and the library bill of rights should make informed
 the library quarterly decisions about lesbigay issues within the profession and with respect to the library public not from an artificial stance of political correctness but because homophobia which is historically related to sexism and racism   contradicts basic tenets of equality of access and service while lesbigay issues may directly affect only a small portion of the population from  to  percent according to the most recent estimates  p   pp   they have general relevance to the entire society moreover it is exactly because lesbigays form such a small minority of the population that their interests welfare and civil liberties demand closer attention most important if librarian researchers choose not to study the lives of lesbigays in their ranks someone may do it for them anyway sociologist christine williams  for example discusses gays in librarianship nursing social work and elementary school teaching in her study of men in female professions the relative complacency of librarians toward gender inequities has been noted by the committee on the status of women in librarianship  and the degree of gender denial in librarianship  no doubt has considerable bearing on the absence of attitude surveys concerning lesbigay issues and the obliqueness of studies bearing on lesbigay professional rights in the library community lesbigay concerns have been recognized already by professional associations as academically diverse as the american medical association ama and the american historical association aha the ama banned discrimination based on sexual orientation in  the aha however finds that such professional policies may in fact carry little weight in the workplace according to a  survey that reported incidents of workplace discrimination from colleagues students andor administrators among  percent of lesbigay aha member respondents   although ala council has affirmed its support for lesbigay library workers in the ala policy manual see secs  and  particularly the programs and activities of glbtf have received almost no attention in published discussions of professional meetings within ala during the s and minimal historical discussion see for example  among library educators writings and research on lesbigay issues have been practically nonexistent recently attention to sexual abuse of students by professors has escalated in the media  and reflects in part the prejudice that exists against lesbigay educators in schools  pp       the latter phenomenon exacerbates the already marginal situation of  jessie daniel ames spoke out especially against the southern iynchings which were carried out supposedly to protect the honor of southern white women for african american women had borne the sexual assaults of southern white males since slavery had been instituted the hypocritical southern system in fact disempowered all women african american women as well as white women the enthroned diadems of dixie

 the library quarterly that the current research project was planned the denver decision was not a popular one nor was the relocation to philadelphia for similar reasons of the  cincinnati midwinter meeting which occurred shortly after plans for the current research project were under way these events provided the professional context within which the current study was conducted project objectives the purpose of this study was to assess the attitudes of  library school graduates on lesbigay issues within the context of professional social responsibilities prejudice against lesbigays is the last socially acceptable prejudice according to tom gaughan who defended american libraries  cover photograph of lesbigay librarians in the gay pride day parade in a subsequent editorial  and exclusive attention is given to that issue in this report although our study also covered related issues graduates of  were selected as the population because their attitudes about social issues were assumed to reflect the end result of their formal professional education as many of them had only been on their jobs a short while and many were still searching for jobs their ideas might be expected to be reflective of their education rather than bound by workplace attitudes while the survey instrument could have been focused exclusively on lesbigay issues we felt that the response rate would be augmented by an instrument that inquired about attitudes toward lesbigay issues within more general social concerns the study measures the relationship between social responsibilities issues in the curriculum of recent mlismls graduates in their library and information studies lis education and their current attitudes toward selected social issues sexual orientation womengender issues political correctness legal redress for minorities and the relative importance of social responsibilities in the library and information profession the focus of the present report sexual orientation is perhaps the most volatile of the issues listed and is long overdue for consideration given the lack of research studies that have accompanied the editorial polemic on the issue in the past few years specifically are the attitudes of lesbigay librarians toward professional and social issues and especially lesbigay issues any different than those of their straight cohort is sexual orientation a valid predictor of attitudes toward social responsibilities issues and specifically lesbigay issues or are there other factors that are more useful indicators for example age sex library type most important what role does an mlismls program play in shaping the attitudes of students to

the last socially acceptable prejudice  graduates changed their interests in particular types of libraries for a variety of reasons although no reason was so prevalent as the unstable job market over a quarter of the sample worked in a different type of agency than they had initially planned to when entering an mlis mls program the qualitative comments indicated that job availability was the most prevalent reason for changing library type other general reasons for changing directions were course work changing impressions such as a negative practicum experience in a law library cited by one respondent and a spiritual calling to work in a particular denominational college the disciplinary choices of this sample as indicated by undergraduate second master and doctorate degrees confirmed findings about the educational background of mlismls students nearly  percent of the sample had obtained a master degree before entering an mlismls program and another seven individuals had earned a second master only eleven individuals had obtained a doctorate while twenty eight subjects had earned other degrees associate degree or law degree for example the majority of graduates obtained their degrees in the humanities or social sciences classifications used were those listed in  pp  lo the master major area followed the same pattern with education social science performing arts and letters accounting for the greatest number of degrees and in the second master category only marketing and philosophyreligion were new to the list as for lesbigays nearly twice as great a proportion earned undergraduate degrees in the performing arts compared to the straight cohort a greater percentage of lesbigays held master degrees in education performing arts and philosophy and religion methodological concerns based on respondent comments respondents completed the likert scale questionnaire consisting of thirty three statements covering general attitudes toward social responsibility issues in the profession and society items        diversity and political correctness items     women issues in society and in the profession including legal redress for inequities items      gays and lesbians in society and in the profession items       coverage of gays and lesbians in the library media items      and treatment of social responsibilities women issues and gay and lesbian issues in the curriculum of mlismls programs items       items  and   the largest groups represented were letters  percent social science  percent education  percent performing arts  percent and communications and psychology  percent each
 the library quarterly asked respondents to specify courses where they had learned about social responsibilities and gay and lesbian issues at the outset it should be noted that a few criticisms sometimes severe were received from some respondents concerning the design and construction of the questionnaire whereas we had purposefully intended certain items to embody attitudes representative of those current in the editorial columns of american libraries the mainstream press and the talk show host circuit in an effort to elicit spontaneous reactions to controversial social issues statements some respondents resented what they interpreted as bias ambiguity and unclear language for example political correctness and professional and questioned items that had been slightly rephrased elsewhere on the questionnaire or recast as negative statements for example items  and  it was quite clear from the open ended responses received that some respondents were thoroughly satiated with discussion of multiculturalism political correctness women issues and lesbigay issues in society at large in the media and in the library and information profession at the same time some responses also indicated that these issues had not received serious study in library literature or consistent coverage in mlis mls curricula a few canadian respondents were offended that the questionnaire they received was not translated into french while several canadian respondents expressed confusion over items referring to the first amendment to the us constitution the most strongly worded criticism addressed what was perceived by a respondent as a failure on our part to make the intentions of the survey more clear i do not think any attempt was made to create an unbiased survey the use of such phrases as editorial backlash in the professional community and the way some of your questions are worded damage the integrity of your study as researchers and library educators i would hope you would have learned these basics in you own library education i also think you should have defined ocial responsibilities of librarians my social responsibility as a librarian is to provide equal access and service regardless of race color sexual orientation ethnic group content of question etc if you are going to do a study on gay and lesbian issues then do that and be direct about your intentions not biased if you need help call the research professor that i had on research methods in librarianship    or ask any student other than the ones you have taught while at least one lesbigay research study advocated self disclosure in interviews  pp   there is no evidence to suggest that such a tactic works better or worse in formal mailed questionnaires particularly in the preliminary stages although one of the authors was privately counseled by a former doctoral adviser that the categories gay and lesbian should be flatly avoided on questionnaires as that would nega
the last socially acceptable prejudice  tively affect any response rate perhaps self disclosure should be actively and openly practiced in all research on lesbigay issues it is not a practice that is currently being followed however by many leading lesbigay researchers perhaps because most studies focus on lesbigays whose identity is already known or whose participation has been solicited through lesbigay listservs mailing lists or focus groups the purpose of the present survey was different however since it sought to compare responses of various subgroups of the general population to a variety of issues of which lesbigay issues were only a part equally important was the whole complex of attitudes surrounding the current professional social responsibilities debate for which lesbigay issues may serve as a symbol some respondents fretted over the use to which the survey data would be put the most extensive of these gave a detailed chronicle of imperialistic us policies and indifference to suffering abroad he considered the triviality of the subject of the present survey would reinforce still more denial of and indifference to the world problem and he declined to participate others worried about anonymity or misunderstood the purpose of having coded surveys namely for follow up purposes the codes on two returned questionnaires were removed while one person circled the code and noted that this kind of thing lowers the response rate several respondents also worried about the lack of a truly neutral response such as don know or no opinion on the survey form at least one respondent failed to answer three items and marked i don know next to each item and one returned blank survey was accompanied by a letter that explained that being a recent graduate disqualified her from judging social issues short of providing an even more attenuated list of options or a true forced choice questionnaire we believed that both agree and disagree reflected the nature and degree of ambiguity evident in conversations about these issues with colleagues and students a decision was therefore made to interpret at least some measure of agreement with the statements as partially supportive of them given that they are statements reflective of attitudes not statements of fact given that some statements are phrased negatively and some positively and given that the respondent would agree with the statement in at least some circumstances in some cases that interpretation may not be correct so that readers should be aware of possible overreporting  in  for example noted southern gay sociologist james t sears sent a survey on the status of lesbigay education faculty to selected individuals at southeastern universities and asked them to circulate the questionnaire to other lesbigay faculty members with whom they were acquainted
 the library quarterly on these issues and balance the interpretation with open ended comments received a more serious problem related to the response not discussed at all in items  and  relating to coverage of social issues in specific courses which some respondents apparently skipped over leaving the entire item blank apparently they did not read the item carefully enough to realize that there was a space to indicate noncoverage using hindsight that part of the item should have been a separate item entirely still another problem related to the terminology of course titles technical services is not employed in many programs for example and foundationstype courses exist under many different guises from the library in society to issues in librarianship in reporting which courses covered social responsibilities issues and lesbigay issues we have made an attempt to determine the nature of the course collapse courses into appropriate categories and preserve the integrity of unique course titles where appropriate findings lesbigay issues in the profession six items called for responses to statements reflecting attitudes about lesbigays in the profession items       see table  four of these related to lesbigay library materials and library policies regarding lesbigay materials items     since these topics have been covered to a small extent in library literature it was assumed that they were more likely to have been discussed in mlismls courses moreover they were issues with which graduates may have had firsthand experience whether or not they were acquainted with any openly lesbigay individuals two other items related to the perception of the number of lesbigays in the profession item  and the personal feelings of respondents toward lesbigay issues and literature item  less than a fifth of respondents  percent agreed or strongly agreed that there was a higher percentage of lesbigays in the profession than in society at large and  percent disagreed or strongly disagreed with this statement this finding reflects either knowledge or opinion on the part of respondents since to date there is no empirical evidence that would support the notion that there is a larger proportion of lesbigays in the library profession than in other professions or than in the general population although that view occasionally surfaces  and in some locales may be accurate twenty four individuals  percent disagreed strongly with gay and lesbian literature on principle and would not buy it for a library unless demand warranted such an action another thirty six disagreed
the las t socially acceptable prejudice  with this item while sixty seven both agreed and disagreed in other words a total of  percent of the sample either disapproved of nonheterosexual ideology entirely or at least the lesbigay literature they had seen this persistence of negative reactions to lesbigay literature is understandable since a large part of lesbigay expression was confined for many years to underground or pornographic literature the majority of mainstream lesbigay history sociology and fiction only began to appear about twenty five years ago the proliferation of university publishing in this area has flourished only in the past decade and only in the past few years have gale research book review index information access company and university microfilms both electronic format and the modern language association bibliography included lesbigay titles in their lists of indexed periodicals  as of june  the h w wilson company indexes do not include mainstream lesbigay periodical titles in spite of petitions over the last five years from the glbtf indexing project to include the advocate blk gay community news the lesbian news outlook and outweek in readers guide to periodical literature therefore it can be assumed that at least some part of this hostile group of respondents were simply unaware of the variety and depth of lesbigay titles now available that at least a part of them had an ideological stance that was not inclusive of lesbigays and that some shared both reservations about the topic certainly the most controversial books in the past few years were heather has two mommies and daddy roommate titles that opened up new avenues of discussion on alternative parenting the authors included a statement about these titles since it seemed likely that most recent graduates would be familiar with the numerous challenges the books have received in libraries more than three quarters of respondents  percent agreed or strongly agreed that they would acquire these titles for a public library if they were the best titles of their type available a smaller proportion of graduates  percent agreed or strongly agreed that lesbigay issues should be addressed through collection development in all areas of the library as to how lesbigay materials here labeled controversialshould be handled in communities where there is a strong antigay sentiment only  percent of the sample unequivocally agreed that lesbigay materials should be sequestered that is kept off open shelves in communities where there is a strong antigay sentiment while  percent unequivocally disagreed only  percent of respondents agreed with sequestering when the caveat to prevent theft or defacement was added to the statement lesbigays were more likely than straight subjects to advocate compre the statement of this item was flawed in that it asked for perceptions on two separate issues a defect that did not surface in pretesting

 the library quarterly bigay issues specifically in designated courses the visual presentation of items  and  relating to courses in which social responsibilities and lesbigay issues were covered created problems we decided to use the likert format with these items to account for shades of coverage as in other questions the neutral response both agree and disagree was difficult to interpret when data analysis began and we finally decided to collapse the categories strongly agree agree and both agree and disagree to indicate that the topic was covered in some manner in the course as reported above the likert scale responses confused some subjects on these questions and some apparently did not notice the option not discussed at all although it was clear in some cases that the issues had not been covered respondents to items  and  who marked other courses were also asked to supply titles of courses in which these issues were covered because of the nonresponse rate and some apparent confusion on items  and  only descriptive statistics are reported for these two items over half of the respondents  percent agreed or strongly agreed that their mlismls education introduced them to the concept of social responsibilities of librarians and only  percent disagreed or strongly disagreed this finding would seem to underscore the need for coverage of these issues in mlismls curricula although it should be tempered with the knowledge that not all social responsibilities issues receive equal coverage at the present time for example  percent unequivocally agreed that multicultural diversity had received some special emphasis in the curriculum while only  percent agreed that women issues had received similar emphasis while only  percent agreed that women issues were not discussed at all in the item that asked respondents to rate coverage of these issues in specific courses  percent agreed that lesbigay issues were not covered at all students usually learned about social responsibilities item  in foundations courses  percent or in public service courses like reference  percent they also discussed them in some administration management courses in dealing with personnel concerns and clientele base  percent or in library courses  percent where library constituency was an appropriate topic only  percent marked a diversity type course although comments that accompanied this choice seemed to indicate that not many such electives were currently offered students sometimes learned about social responsibilities in research methods courses  percent and more rarely in technical services courses  percenta finding that is surprising given the effort expended in recent decades on revising subject headings for groups like specific native tribes women and lesbigays only  percent learned about social responsibilities in a specific intellectual freedomethics course
the last socially acceptable prejudice  as for lesbigay issues item  coverage is at best uneven approximately a quarter  percent learned about lesbigay issues in foundations courses and a quarter  percent heard about them in reference courses in a fifth of cases  percent students learned about the concerns of lesbigays in a library type course where specific clientele needs were discussed only half as many persons who agreed they learned about social responsibilities in a diversity type course learned about lesbigay issues in such a course  percent and they only occasionally learned about them in research methods  percent technical services  percent collection management  percent or intellectual freedomethics courses  percent two respondents opined that coverage of lesbigay issues occurred only because their professor was gay and had an interest in the subject given the apparent lack of consistency in coverage of lesbigay issues when they are covered at all it is perhaps encouraging that research methods courses occasionally take up the subject since from the viewpoint of methodology and the identification of appropriate and researchable questions much work obviously remains to be done qualitative comments open ended comments ranging from terse statements to essays were received from seventy seven individuals  percent it is not the purpose of this report to provide a detailed analysis of these comments but rather to provide a characterization of those most relevant to social responsibilities and lesbigay issues particularly as they relate to the curricula of mlismls programs and to the profession some comments were frankly tangential to the study several people expounded on issues they thought deserved fuller coverage in the curriculum that were not covered by the survey for example environmental issues persons with physical disabilities world poverty and hunger and unemployment others discounted the lesbigay focus and advocated addressing women issues first too much coverage of gay and lesbian issues in the media let work on breaking the glass ceiling other comments were useful in clarifying defects in the survey as in the case of one school media specialist who marked both agree and disagree for three items she did not know how to answer and in the cases of persons who objected to the use of vague ambiguous or loaded terms like liberal conservative and political correctness in identifying areas that deserve further study as did one southern female librarian who remarked that she really had no idea what effect affirmative actionequal opportunity act has on the library profession and in tracking and clarifying the conflicted if somewhat virulent reactions the survey provoked i feel that the gay rights movement has beaten the issue into the ground and like whitewater i sick of hearing about
 the library quarterly it and wish that life would move on and some strength of character emerge to move forward from self pity and spoiled child tantrums from qualitative comments it is clear that some subjects had been tracking lesbigay issues as covered by the library media and that this may have accounted for some of their negative reactions one person for example felt that the lobby type power wielded by ala in canceling the  denver conference because of colorado antilesbigay initiative was scary and heavy handed one southern female quoted above commented that the lesbigay cover on  american libraries coupled with political activism pro gaylesbian in the national office has caused many members to drop off especially in the conservative south she also mentioned high membership fees as a factor in accounting for these feelings as some feel that by paying annual dues they are contributing to a political cause they do not support ironically total responses received from southeastern mlismls graduates supported greater coverage of lesbigay issues in the library media see statistical analysis and accompanying caveat above some graduates felt daunted by the prospect of initiating an active program in collection of lesbigay materials after graduation however and they were as likely to be intimidated by their colleagues as their patrons one librarian in a new york city public library branch was surrounded by coworkers who were vehemently anti gay one actually said hat would happen to the population if everyone turned gay and seemed sincerely threatened by the lifestyle another whose big eight mlismls program did not really address gay and lesbian issues felt unprepared for the flap over formation of a gay and lesbian club at a community college and under the direction of the librarian was assembling a list of titles in case community members come into the library to challenge us about lesbigay holdings as for coverage of lesbigay issues in the curriculum while one marked the item relating to discussion of lesbigay issues not discussed at all and appended the epithet thank god several other subjects all heterosexual wrote comments supportive of the present study complimented its design andor thanked us for giving the opportunity to respond to these issues typical was the following i cannot emphasize how little attention the topic received in my library education the continued omission of the subject in required courses is a great disservice to information professionals of the future thank you for conducting the survey i hope it wakes up some graduate school deans out there graduates of mlismls programs on the whole felt confused about the relationship between social activism and library professionalism questioned the definition of social activism or adopted passive approaches to social issues in other words while they may personally
the last socially acceptable prejudice  espouse liberal causes which to judge from their self selected social orientation in table  the majority apparently do they believe that there is an inherent conflict in active programming to support such a cause outside routine collection development one counseled that if professional librarians wish to campaign for social causes outside the realm of libraries eg free distribution of condoms to fight the spread of aids they should do so as private citizens i say as one who believes in the idea of distributing condoms on the other hand some graduates recognized the paucity of actual research on lesbigay issues in the profession and the fact that many librarians confuse any discussion of gay and lesbian issues with social activism for lesbigay rights discussion and conclusions the present survey is exploratory in nature and deals with issues and factors that are in themselves difficult to isolate discuss dispassionately or study within the somewhat narrow parameters of traditional social scientific research protocols without great expense some colleagues suggested for example that focus group interviews rather than the written questionnaire would be a more appropriate venue for exploration of the topic while also a possible approach we felt that the topic could not be turned over to a discussion group leader at each site without adequate training given the nature of the subject studied how would graduates be assembled at each site how could researchers ensure that someone would be present to defuse gayand straight maleand female liberaland conservative bashing who but ourselves could clarify terminology that safely passed pretesting but presented problems to some respondents moreover the questionnaire offers one incontestable advantage over focus groups in researching controversial topics privacy while the criticisms received were in many cases valid we reasoned from the beginning that the primary purpose of the survey was to open discussion on a previously unexplored topic rather than to create a flawless model for future researchers as lesbian researcher lynn keenaghan has noted there is no sense in closing a door that is not yet opened whether that door leads to the private closets of research subjects personal lives or presents an exit from the positivist assumptions that have discouraged lesbigay and feminist research and further served to institutionalize discrimination  pp   in other words would it have been better not to conduct the survey at all we believed not many so called unorthodox techniques have to be tested before the limits of social research can be ascertained and in no other research area is this fact more evident than that which covers sensitive topics
 the library quarterly  pp   oral history and other qualitative techniques have been refined in recent years for example to incorporate reader response theory no longer is the interpretation of a scientific authority the researcher deemed necessary to lend credence or validity to life history narratives  incorporates this view  describes it  represents the traditional approach it is the historians skills that prove most valuable in checking out disputed facts in oral histories and the less obtrusively these corrections are made the better since how a person remembers events may be as important as what they remember certainly on a topic such as lesbigay issues in librarianship on which there is virtually no research and to which there is much conscious and unconscious resistance at least some research conventions spawned by the straightgeist  have to be muted so that a minimum of baseline data can be established one readily apparent finding of the survey is that there is no consistency in approach to the treatment of social issues generally and lesbigay concerns specifically in mlismls curricula and these findings are bolstered by qualitative comments in part these discrepancies reflect a curriculum already crowded with new technology courses three individuals were openly contemptuous of their library education claiming that they learned absolutely nothing new or useful to them and one characterized hers as a pleasant waste of time the majority of those who made comments seemed generally supportive of the programs they had attended probably the most important finding of the survey is that self selected social orientation for example liberal conservative more than any other factor determines how respondents react to social responsibilities including lesbigay issues see table  there were significant differences in the responses to twenty two statements depending on self described social orientation on twelve items depending on sex of respondent eleven items depending on sexual orientation of respondent on seven items depending on whether or not the respondent had known someone who died of aids five by library type and four by age another finding expected but now confirmed is that general issues of lesbigay status and questions about lesbigay materials in the library are by far the most volatile of the issues covered by the present survey responses to nineteen items in this category show statistically significant differences the treatment of lesbigay issues by the library media account for statistically significant differences on thirteen items and general social responsibilities twelve items and diversitypolitical correctness eleven items account for nearly as many differences in reporting statistical data detailed analysis has been given only for the factors of sexual orientation although it is worth emphasizing that

 the library quarterly twice as many items are likely to be answered in a given direction based on self selected social orientation and for seventeen of these items p   in itself this finding suggests that discussion of social issues including sexual orientation is highly politicized in the current social environment this should temper interpretation of claims of librarian neutrality found in many of the open ended comments given separately in the survey whatever the claims of neutrality in professionalism attitudes and perceptions are apparently affected by social orientation labels along the liberal conservative spectrum however much as the respondents might seek an ideal neutrality their professional attitudes are shaped by social forces librarians response to social issues is a topic that deserves extensive future study especially since it has apparently been ignored in favor of more pressing library issues also the sparsity of research in related areas such as authoritarian attitudes of librarians vis vis censorship merits attention since in library education the information is quite dated  and the social climate has altered dramatically in the past quarter century thus while lesbigay issues may not be the most urgent concern facing libraries even in terms of collection development they certainly deserve some mention in the pantheon of worthy social concerns facing librarians in their dealings with the public and with their colleagues and a great deal more intelligent analysis than has yet been forthcoming unfortunately the empty argument that homosexuality is a volatile issue among many segments of the population and therefore damages the librarian image will not make the issue go away lesbigays are a vocal minority in society and the general population confuses media coverage of the more sensational or colorful aspects of lesbigay life such as the san francisco gay pride day parade replete with drag queens dykes on bikes bearded men in nun habits and other expressive or exhibitionist behavior with the struggles of a minority for acceptance equal protection under law and freedom from harassment and ignominy in the workplace and in the community  while librarians give at least passing mention to lesbigay clients they rarely connect their concerns to the daily lives of their lesbigay colleagues if indeed they even know or care who these individuals are it cannot be denied that some lesbigay librarians fear being discovered since their livelihoods if not their careers may be at stake on the whole library school graduates of  are theoretically supportive of lesbigays as an embattled minority although some of them would rather confine thinking about lesbigay issues to the home news hour rather than deal with these issues in their professional lives libraries for some represent a safe haven from the squalor of endless talkshow setups with representatives of the lesbigay community who would
the last socially acceptable prejudice  be by any account lesbigay or straight unusual such as the oprah winfrey sally jesse raphael sideshows library education curricula are crowded already and may not be able to concentrate on social issues any more than they already do in courses such as foundations management and reference what they can do is refocus discussion in these courses to incorporate lesbigay issues routinely along with other groups in the social spectrum who have special needs and are perhaps receiving only the theoretical benefits of a democratic society while they continue to experience intentional or subliminal discrimination in their daily lives one of the promises implicit in a democratic society is the right of individuals to receive equal treatment under the law and one of the promises tendered by the library profession in this society is that all persons will be able to receive the information they need when it is needed it is hard to understand how the latter scenario can prevail if librarians are unfamiliar with their lesbigay clientele and coworkers or are hostile to them while only a handful of responses received to this survey recount incidents of such hostility or express such hostility they are pervasive enough to warrant greater examination of what professional librarians learn in their mlismls programs the fact that some programs choose to ignore lesbigay issues entirely may in part reflect the paucity of serious research on the subject or the ignorance of instructors about lesbigay research needs or the reluctance of lesbigay researchers to be tagged throughout their career for having pursued what some consider to be a trivially dangerous subject one straight midwestern library school professor commented to us that he had tried repeatedly to persuade lesbigay students who are out to select a lesbigay research topic to no avail that conversation was in fact the genesis for this study it is doubtful that lesbigay librarians will receive much support for this line of research in the near future unless their concerns are validated in mlismls curricula and by professors one lesbian canadian student expressed this need succinctly thank you for your work in this area as a gay member of this profession i have often chosen to keep quiet about social responsibilities in work environments and in the classroom setting unfortunately mlis degrees focus on theory and technical abilities while ignoring to a great extent the social responsibilities of future professionals open discussions are few    magistral courses are many i have much to learn about my gayness as it is quite new to me however i feel that work on lesbigay issues is indeed important and necessary in the area of lis degree curricula the profession exists today without a view of the overall attitudes of library professionals toward the social responsibility mandate one recent letter to american libraries  has suggested that opposition to
 the library quarterly social activism in past years has come from two camps  those librarians who oppose lesbigay interests generally and therefore deny the validity of lesbigay claims in the professional context and  those who have no particular aversion to lesbigays within the profession but feel that social activism with political implications detracts from the proper sphere of professional practice such impressions as these should be ascertained and explored further for they have profound implications for future discussions of all social issues within the profession more important library educators need more feedback on what if any orientation students receive to librarianship social values while it may be assumed that intellectual freedom should be important to all beginning professionals definitions of that term among assorted individuals yield more complex and less monolithic definitions than have been previously supposed this study presents one interpretation of attitudes toward social issues expressed by beginning professionals a group whose personal profile can be projected to be different from their s counterparts in a slightly different sense however these attitudes conform to alice bryan classic characterization of public librarian attitudes according to bryan public librarians reflected majority public sentiment in endorsement of specific legislation whatever its liberal conservative orientation at the same time these librarians exhibited lower than average norms in social leadership and selfconfidence like many respondents to the present survey they expressed concern that the library schools and their faculties lack understanding of the educational and social objectives of libraries  pp    a present day modified replication of bryan study is greatly needed if for no other reason than that we know so little about who librarians are and how they have changed in response to a basically transformed society a study such as bryan would be difficult to conduct today given recent bureaucratic and legalistic interpretations of confidentiality in social research and these restrictions should be investigated and assailed in research methods and archives courses in ala and in the courts equally important is the need for a study of the minority who are isolated on the conservative end of the present attitudinal survey for they also have often been unfairly stereotyped as zealots and much worse as one respondent explained referring to his work in a denominational school i was a little amazed at receiving this survey my religious ffiliation is in the minority and my working  for example bryan measured their attitudes toward the taft hartley act which restricted the power of labor unions and required a loyalty oath disavowing membership in the communist party the marshall plan which extended postwar foreign aid and the lifting of tariffs
the last socially acceptable prejudice  situation is far different from what the public views as ocially acceptable it remains to be seen whether or not librarians will indeed become professional leaders in welcoming research that is lesbigay friendly even in a reactionary social environment or whether they will recognize lesbigay rights only as forced to by legal precedent to judge from the responses received in the present survey the personal is indeed political as sartre once observed and professional too the neutral position reflects a professional political stance as much as do liberal or conservative stances how much this neutral stance represents a desirable attitude in the s an age in which some large corporations seem to be leading the way in lesbigay friendly policies and work situations is a question that library educators will need to address as the disparity between the rhetoric and the reality of librarians work situation comes to the attention of outside observers appendix social responsibilities survey for each of the following statements below circle one of the numbers in the right hand column using the following key   strongly agree with statement   disagree with statement   agree with statement   strongly disagree with   both agree and disagree statement  professionals should remain aloof from social activism       the library profession is more socially progressive than most professions       my education in librarianship introduced me to the concepts of librarians social responsibility       libraries and librarians have a responsibility to address social issues    women issues received some special emphasis in my lis curriculum       materials on controversial topics such as gay and lesbian issues should be kept off open shelves in communities where there is a strong anti gay sentiment       the library media distorts gay and lesbian issues within the library profession        learned most about social responsibilities of librarians through the following courses
