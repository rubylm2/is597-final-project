the library quarterly volume iii january i number i community studies in reading i reading in the lower east side t rhe colorful section of new york lower east side which ten years ago was renowned for squalid tenements occasional geniuses and social dynamite is served by the seward park branch of the public library the district extends south and east to the river from houston street on the north and mulberry street on the west today much of its intellectual energy has escaped into brooklyn and the bronx the eager groups of young radicals with whom lincoln steffens went to school in the back rooms of the wine shops are now older and less eager and less radical most have moved away the remnant live on their memories and hope for better times although the district is within a five cent fare of the cultural centers of greater new york and in spite of several attractive building developments it is characterized by poverty a falling population the passing of its distinctive old world tradition and perhaps by a declining interest in substantial reading as such it was accordingly selected by the new york public library as a good one to compare with more favored districts like that served by the fordham branch in the bronx by means of several such comparisons it should be possible to learn something of the nature and scope of serious reading in typical
 the library qu arterly communities and also to define the importance of the library as one of many sources of supply with the wise advice and close co operation of the publiclibrary authorities two of us devoted some seven weeks in the district during the summer of i to the single purpose of finding methods whereby the distribution of reading matter could be studied with the greatest ease we were after two sorts of method first short cuts to sales reports for newspapers magazines and books together with data on the relative turnover of titles in rental libraries and second methods of finding from public library records by whom and how much different sorts of reading matter are read the latter is not easy hence a short report of progress is to say that such methods have been found and are probably not too complicated for any interested librarian to apply to his own community to understand the distribution of reading matter one must be able to answer such questions as these what proportion of the population are readers from what sources or agencies such as newsstands rental libraries home libraries settlement libraries bookstores pushcarts book clubs reading rooms and public libraries do the readers get their reading what kinds of reading matter and what proportion of each kind does each occupational group obtain from each source to answer such questions with any completeness is a long hard job but answers complete enough to be useful to the libraries may be secured from official records of the various distributing agencies that is to say the local chambers of commerce receive daily census data based on duplicate removal notices from the gas companies the two or three news agencies that monopolize the community can estimate the local sales of morning papers and newsstand magazines a single supplyhouse can usually report the titles most demanded in local rental libraries bookstores must be canvassed one by one especially the secondhand bookstores book clubs unfortunately do not classify their subscribers by districts but the  we are especially indebted to mr joseph platzker secretary east side chamber of commerce for cordial and indispensable assistance
community studies in reading  classification can be made from their mailing lists pamphleteering agencies like political and commercial organizations have figures on the distribution of each title such are too small to be important in the lower east side data on library distribution can with sufficient patience be obtained from library records expressions of reading interests and reports on actual reading by the community at large are obtainable through any of the political trade and social organizations who can be persuaded to fill out blanks granting the possibility of securing such facts one may well ask what they are worth there are at least four plausible answers in the first place an estimate of community reading on problems of international relations federal legislation control of government by vested interests justice to and from minorities economic policies political honesty and the like is perhaps the best single index of social intelligence if the writing be sincere competent and multi partisan the more widely it is read the better for the whole community its consumption by the general reader is a fair measure of social consciousness of the desire to meet critical issues rationally and of unwillingness to evade them hence the facts about community reading on current social problems teach us much about man as a social animal they help us to find out how social he is according to his occupation age schooling race and habitat such facts show what intellectually curious people are curious about sociologists in particular and intelligent folk generally should welcome such information secondly the facts show what reading is actually worth in the given community as a vehicle for ideas and as compared with other arts of communication one sure thing is that critical reading in some american communities is not provoked even by national disaster the angels weep when devout public librarians foist good reading upon a radio minded town potentially reading satisfies genuine intellectual curiosities better than any other art of communication first because ideas in writing are permanent and second because they can
 the library quirterly be made so readily available whereas conversation with a properly informed friend supplies ideas with far greater convenience the ideas evaporate motion pictures supply ideas more vividly but the producer prescribes the ideas the time and the place museum exhibits lectures school courses and other media also lack either permanence or availability or both but simply to possess these advantages does not give first place to reading as a source of the community ideas whether or not reading contributes anything to community culture depends entirely upon the community disposition to read hence before we take adult reading too seriously it behooves us to learn how successfully reading competes wvith the other arts of communication the percentage of serious readers in its different occupational classes is a fair indication of what reading means to the community in the third place and assuming that adult reading is sufficient in amount and distribution to be an important source of ideas we need to know how library reading in the given community compares with reading obtained from other sources if only to avoid expensive duplication given a picture of the total reading situation where does library reading fit in to answer this question is the first step toward a planned economy of public librarianship that is a program aimed at results of cultural value to the whole community that are not accomplished by other agencies it matters much to any community at any time whether its tax supported institutions serve a large or a small part of the population to what ends such service is directed and how effectively the same ends are served by competing private agencies in times of economic collapse these questions matter a great deal more particularly to the watchdogs of the city treasury hence the urge toward self preservation if not professional curiosity should make them interesting having mastered the essential problems of administration and come to grips with the psychology of reading librarians now confront the mysteries of sociology the present time is ripe for a formulation of social policy and we lack the necessary facts
community studies in reading  a fourth reason for collecting the facts is that the more we know about the sort of reading most acceptable to different population groups the better able we are to select good reading for the library we cannot say what reading is good reading until we can answer the questions good for whom  and good for what the pulitzer committee decides that the good earth is a good book for whom is it a good book obviously for the committee and others who share its taste for the sort of english mrs buck writes who are stirred by the human fortitude depicted in the narrative and who wish to follow the epic tragedy played in china today but who are thus included certainly not the americans of long residence in china who find the novel too harrowing to be endurable certainly not the  per cent of our population who read no books at all certainly not the  per cent of book readers who read only trivial fiction for escape from serious thinking certainly not the scrappy readers probably about go per cent of the population who read on vital problems only what they find in the press and magazines and certainlyznotthe small but important group of readers who seriously study the problems of civilization that now have their storm center in china for the last many other recent and authoritative books on far eastern politics will be of more direct value as the nationalist program for china by c c wu russia and the soviet union in the far east by v a yakhontoff twenty years after the chinese republic by harold a van dorn china speaks on the conflict between china and apan by c meng and chinese revolution by a n holcome hence the library selection of good reading on china or on any other subject appealing to the general reader must be based upon evidence concerning the reading obtained from other sources and concerning the reading abilities educational status and subject interests of groups who actually use the library what follows is a selection from several questions on which there are tentative findings to report various other questions of equal or greater importance may be discussed when the
 the librafry quarterly study is extended to neighborhoods served by other branches of the new york public library if similar data are collected in other urban and rural neighborhoods the generalizations reached will be far more useful to the public library administrator i how many residents are readersby residents we mean people over fifteen years of age who live in the area surrounding the seward park branch we know the area of the branch registration by the actual distribution of addresses by readers we mean readers of the daily morning newspapers as estimated from sales in the district comparing the sales per person and the number of readers of each newspaper purchased with the population over fifteen years old we estimate o per cent as newspaper readers this is considerably lower than other estimates of readers in the population at large which range from  per cent to  per cent  how much is readfrom each sourcethe o per cent read ten metropolitan dailies plus about six evening papers four of which are jewish the latter are more given to thought provoking articles and less to advertising than the general run of english papers there are some i newsstands in the district selling english and foreign papers weekly bi weekly and monthly story magazines and weekly and bi monthly reviews the foreign press sales are nearly half of the english jewish polish russian hungarian and spanish papers sell in the order named an astonishing fact in connection with press sales is that sales of all papers have decreased at virtually the same rate since january  and are still decreasing rapidly with no sign of recovery it is a significant commentary on the radicalism of the once radical lower east side that the sales of leftwing papers have fallen off at the same rate as the sales of the conservative dailies and the tabloids newspaper reading in settlement house reading rooms and in the public libraries is negligible as compared with newsstands story magazines of the cheaper sorts are read by roughly half the adult readers of the district and of course by many children

community studies in reading  with every expectation of having other and better explanations offered one may suggest the hypothesis that the public library is regarded in the lower east side if not elsewhere as a sort of club membership confers distinction and carries a certain exclusiveness that is to say to become a library member one has certain adjustments to make which taken en masse explain why so few readers use the library some of the adjustments may be mentioned off hand others should be determined by controlled studies of readers who are table iii showing percentile analysis of  loans to  borrowers classified by sex and occupation group percentage of percentage of groups elans borrowers all men   s    all women    i  total of both sexes    students    office workers  i  skilled trades    i professional  io  unskilled  s i shopkeepers men only     total    not library users to see ourselves as the non library user sees us is our plain duty as a service organization among the conditions which obviously affect popular use of the library are the frequent failures to obtain a desired title at the desired time the perplexities and consequent irritation of a large classed catalogue the inability to smoke which should bother some women as much as it bothers some men lack of toilet facilities lack of reading privacy distance from the library to the home time restrictions on loans fines for books overdue library hours that may or may not coincide with one ability and inclination to visit the library not to mention opportunities for leisurely reading the strangeness of the subject headings and the distrac

community studies in reading  question is to list the titles for which two book cards were used up during a period of two months that such an answer is wholly inadequate is plain from the facts that whereas recent books are most widely read at least two years are required to fill up a book card on fourteen day loans the only other available evidence of relative popularity whatever that may mean consists in the number of reserved applications for titles in use this measure perhaps is even less satisfactory since certain popular titles like mystery stories and certain works of nonfiction are sometimes exempt from such reservation books at the binders and otherwise out of commission are included with books in active circulation in the reserves and no one has yet devised a formula whereby to estimate the relative popularity of titles according to the ratio of the number of copies in circulation to the number of applications reserved this concrete problem clearly invites investigation meanwhile we can only report the most popular of the titles two years old which were sampled the seventeen are as follows cytron avek fun volk durant story of philosophy feuchtwanger ugly duchess fitch plays hayes political and social history of modern europe kellock houdini his lifc story krasnov kostia the kossack lewisohn last days of shylock maeterlinck blue bird oeill dynamo porter sixes and sevens priestley angel pavement remarque the road back rosenfeld yiddishe geshikhte wassermann gold wells short stories zangwill children of the ghetto required reading in the schools few as they are the titles might suggest the major interests of the lower east side were it not for the fact that the fitch hayes and maeterlinck titles are required reading in the
