iv out of sight out of mind why don we have any schools of library and reading studies wayne a wiegand this article argues that current library and information science lis thinking has drawn definitional boundaries around the word information so tightly as to exclude research on reading a major means by which americans obtain information whether it comes off the printed page or the computer screen this paper is intended to  bring the dimensions of contemporary research on reading to the attention of the lis community  encourage lis educators to consider the relevance of this research to a future they are preparing for the lis professions  ask provocative questions exploring race age gender and especially socioeconomic class issues that at this point reside largely on the margins of our current professional discourse and  suggest a price the lis profession will pay if it continues to ignore reading research most of you probably remember press coverage of the opening of san francisco new central public library sfpl nearly a year ago american libraries called it a triumph of community support library journal had then director ken dowlin pose with mayor willie brown in front of the new building for the cover of its april  issue that same day the new york times ran an entire column on the event little noticed amidst all the hoopla however was a letter nine year old thea bosselmann wrote to the san francisco chronicle after visiting the new library she could find no nancy drew books there she told the chronicle they are a mystery series about a girl detective    she is brave smart and never gives up i love these books and hope to read them all some day    my mom and lots of other people read them when they were little thea had asked sfpl librarians where the nancy drew books were but librarians said they didn have them there or at any other library in san francisco they don think it good literature when the chronicle asked the library about this omission after running thea letter on may  the system head of children services replied money is placed into materials that meet children informational needs expand their multicultural awareness and experiences and that are of a higher literary quality people in this audience with some knowledge of american library history know that thea experience is not unique in fact in librarianship we have a heritage of slighting certain kinds of reading in part because we have never bothered to investigate seriously why people want to read them in part because the academy has never supplied us with    volume  number 
why don we have any schools of library and reading studies  about the author wayne a wiegand is professor school of library and information studies university of wisconsin madison this paper was presented at the  alise conference an intellectually plausible rationale identifying the values readers attach to these kinds of reading but recently things have changed in certain sectors of the academy and these changes come precisely at a time when lis educators are talking about reinventing their profession but i worried it appears to me that as we transition into the next century we are constructing a professional discourse that ignores and excludes recent research on reading a major means by which americans obtain information what do i mean by discourse a lot of scholars using the term these days agree that to a large extent people construct their own reality that over time this perceived reality evolves its own language and that in both form and function the language used to describe this reality constitutes discourse these scholars also agree that different groups of people have different definitions of reality and within these different groups people develop a use of their language in which particular words and phrases become coded with deep meaning these meanings are generally understood best by the group members heavily invested in using them coded words and phrases also function to bond group members and exclude outsiders urban street talk or youthful slang constitute two relatively transparent examples these scholars also note that by its very nature discourse is not only enabling it is confining because it imposes limits upon the realm of possibilities perceived by group leaders scholars who analyze the way in which discourse functions also recognize that professions create their own discourses and that professional schools generally reflect these discourses in their curricula where value systems are identified by what is included and what is excluded from the profession selfperceived jurisdiction there the value systems are further refined and prioritized by the construction of core and elective courses a construction that immediately imparts a clear set of priorities to students desiring admission to the profession of course our own profession is no exception and i want to direct my attention today to what i perceive as the confining limits of our evolving professional discourse i start with a useful distinction atkinson draws between the value of the content of information and the value of access to that information in a  library quarterly article atkinson notes that the information services libraries provide are and traditionally have been much more concerned with information access than information content i agree my own study of american library history validates his hypothesis and i have argued elsewhere that the origins of this emphasis can be traced to the late nineteenth century when melvil dewey defined a structure for librarianship that has changed very little since despite the frequent introduction of new information technologies into our professional practice but this emphasis on access i contend has not always served us well because it has led us to treat information primarily as an object and because our fall 
 journal of education for library and information science professional structure requires us to concentrate on access to information objects we have overlooked  indeed largely ignored  growing bodies of scholarship on information content that clearly reveal systemic preferences in that finite universe of information to which our profession seeks to provide access that universe has boundaries directly affecting among many other issues matters of race gender age class and sexuality i contend further that the curricula we are now designing reflects systemic preferences primarily because they ignore overlook and marginalize the value certain groups of people place on the content of certain information objects to illustrate what i mean i will focus on just one of these new literatures for the purposes of this essay for the next few minutes let me take you outside our own world of lis and introduce you to another that is seldom referred to in our literature professional education or professional practice in the past decade or so the scholarship on reading  authored by some of the best minds in the humanities and social sciences and published by some of the world most prestigious presses  has developed and coexisted in a very healthy interdisciplinary mix at this point in its history it falls into four broad categories  literacy studies  a social history of books and reading or print culture history  reader response theory and  an ethnography of reading to these four categories i want to add the scholarship on genre fiction emanating from cultural studies another rapidly growing world of scholarship that to my way of thinking provides an important key to understanding many of the socioculturally based information needs that libraries have been serving for generations but without knowing why more on cultural studies later however a scholarship on reading why now probably several reasons one of which may be an inevitable reaction to the growth of nonprint forms of communication that at this point preoccupies our own world of lis if we will be processing information differently in the future this line of logic rationalizes then how have we been processing information up to now other reasons for a new scholarship on reading include the recent development of a series of theoretical frames in the humanities and the social sciences that suggest the realities we have come to know are at least in part a product of our own making these include postmodernism neo marxism feminist theory foucauldian archeology and new historicism our first category  literacy studies  was largely inaugurated by two books published in  in the literacy myth author graff examines the evolution of literacy in nineteenth century urban america through multiple lenses including social class the relationship of power between groups and efforts of some groups to use literacy to control others while the subject wasn necessarily new graff perspective certainly was and it got people thinking in the printing press as an agent of change eisenstein argues that the west was transformed not so much by an ability to read and write as by the capacity of a printing process recently invented to reproduce that writing technical work was much more rapidly duplicated she notes and research was much more easily preserved and circulated the vernacular became celebrated and homogenized modern criticism was introduced and a set of market circumstances evolved in which authors became celebrities our second category is print culture history which is the history of the production distribution and consumption of print the field of print culture history was launched at mid century by volume  number

 journal of education for library and information science these expectations and memories is almost entirely the province of the reader so what does the wandering viewpoint produce the mind in its neverending quest to make sense of the world around it builds a consistency out of the process of selection that then forms a basis for comprehension the text in part becomes an event in which the reader reacts to what she or he has produced involvement is a condition of the experience but the interaction between the text and the reader is asymmetrical forced by the necessary conditions of interaction because there is no face to face contact between author and reader the reader has no way to test for accuracy of author intention as a result for the reader a text contains blanks and negations which she or he must fill in or resolve these uncertain and indefinite qualities of a text then serve to stimulate blanks function as potential connections because they designate vacancies in the overall system of the text they force a need to combine and connect and in connecting blanks scholars have found the reader mind is triggered into acts of ideation  a highly creative activity with potential for much satisfaction in this country reader response theory has been taken up most persuasively by fish author of the widely influential is there a text in this class fish argues that most readers don read like literary critics instead some of his colleagues point out they poach  raid a text for their own purposes much of that poaching is driven by an individual needs texts are actually sites at which readers activate particular signifiers and follow strategic patterns that are not necessarily intentionally or consciously manipulated in fact investigators have observed that readers function as members of particular interpretive communities  groups of people whose textual mediations tend to follow gender race creed age sexual orientation or class lines and thus their poaching follows patterns common to the group our fourth category  ethnography of reading  is probably best illustrated in a recently published collection of essays bearing that title essayists included come from departments of history classics literature and sociology notice no lis faculty here although they address diverse subjects ranging from the ancient rabbinical readings of hebrew scriptures to the scribes and storytellers of pre modern japan what binds all these investigations together are attempts to define the contexts of actual reading practices exercised in particular groups at particular times for example in textual interpretation as collective action  in my opinion the most relevant essay in the book for lis educators  long suggests that the modern construction of the solitary reader ignores the thoroughly social base for some kinds of reading long combines historical research into turn of the century literary societies and reading clubs with an analysis of sixty groups of houston readers in the s to discover among them all what she calls a social infrastructure she says that this infrastructure includes shared interpretive frameworks participation in a set of institutions social relations and economic activities and then demonstrates how group members mediate their interpretations with each other their cultures and their society at this point let me summarize our four categories literacy studies have shown that understanding the context in which literacy is practiced is vitally important print culture historians have shown that reading is a multilayered highly complex process reader response theorists have shown that in the reading process the reader is an active agent who exercises a great deal of creativity in making sense of texts ethnogvolume number 
why don  we hove any schools of librory ond reoding studies    graphers of reading have shown that reading can be viewed as a communal activity based in a social infrastructure grounded on shared interpretive frameworks and practiced in shared institutions now we come to cultural studies which encompasses the entirety of popular culture of which reading printed texts is only a part cultural studies scholars argue that for purposes of analysis it is important to resist the inclination to judge the quality of cultural products with standards established over the centuries by privileged elites especially those in the academy whose discourse marks this kind of reading with words like trash lowbrow and mind candy instead cultural studies scholars suggest it might be more profitable to focus on emotions like happiness satisfaction fulfillment and pleasure  which are basic to all human beings  as a foundation for comparison much of the philosophical underpinnings for this approach by the way can be gleaned from herrnstein smith widely read contingencies of value alternative perspectives for critical theory perhaps the best way i can illustrate this approach is to ask two questions is it possible that my seventy six year old mother can get as much pleasure from reading a christian romance written by janette oke as i get from reading victor hugo les miserables and if it is possible for each of us to get equal pleasure from the act of reading these two separate texts is it not also possible that the texts can be said to have equal value for each of us despite the fact that our lives are so different herrnstein smith argues that by their very nature all values are highly contingent on a variety of socioeconomic factors if she right cannot her line of logic be extended to values we assign to the act of reading and would the values be especially contingent on factors that separate me and my mother like gender age education and socioeco  nomic class if you can accept the possi  bilities inherent in these kinds of questions for the moment the importance of cultural studies scholarship for lis education will immediately become evi  dent if you can what i am about to say will probably make no sense but before you dismiss the possibility from your mind entirely before you decide to exclude it from your professional discourse let me remind you of thea bosselmann information need she wanted to read about a young iidult female who was brave smart and never gives up the sfpl system head of children services on the other hand worried more about higher literary quality to explain cultural studies i start with fiske understanding popular culture there fiske talks about excorporation a process he explains by which people make their own culture out of the resources and commodities provided them to study popular culture one must not only study the cultural commodities out of which it is made but also the ways that people use them the latter he continues are far more creative and varied than the former shades of reader response theory here but painted across a broader canvas of popular culture in a chapter entitled popular texts fiske taps barthes distinctions between the readerly and writerly text the readerly text barthes argues is a relatively closed text easy to read and undemanding of its readers  perhaps a story in the national enquirer the writerly text on the other hand challenges the reader constantly to rewrite it to make sense out of it  perhaps james joyce ulysses to these two categories of texts fiske adds a third the producerly text which has the accessibility of a readerly one    but the openness of the fall
