in search of multiculturalism in the library science curriculum  to prepare students to work effectively in the real world the change was made because we felt it was appropriate to needs of the students to meet the information needs of all persons in all types of library and information settings not a formal revision but frequent discussions in faculty meetings in which we discussed the need for integration throughout the curriculum just as us society is increasingly multicultural this topic is crucial especially in a program in a state lacking in diversity it is critical to producing well prepared librarians who do not ever work in homogeneous communities these comments reflect a positive response by library science school faculties to either modifying or adapting the library science curriculum to issues of multiculturalism those programs reflect a high awareness of the multicultural issue and some of their respective institutions  have taken steps to address the issues  have considered it in the past and recognize it will be a factor in future discussions of curriculum  have added multicultural related material in core courses  have addressed the issue in a goals and objectives statement and  either have tested or are testing courses in resources and services for special populations twenty four  percent of all respondents reported that no special committee had been established to undertake curriculum modification or revision to incorporate multicultural issues while five  percent indicated that they had such a committee see survey question  eight respondents  percent did not answer this question perhaps because they had offered an affirmative answer to the question about having undertaken curriculum modification or revision the survey sought to ascertain whether library schools would address the issue of modifying or revising the curriculum to include multicultural topics at some future time see survey question  eight respondents  percent reported that they expected the issue would be addressed within the next year while five  percent expected the issue to be considered within the next two years again a large number of respondents  twenty two  percent  offered no answer to this question only one respondent expressed uncertainty that the issue would be addressed while another reported it would be one to two years before attention was devoted to the issue the questionnaire asked how the library schools proposed to go about addressing the issue of curriculum modification or revision see survey question  sixteen respondents  percent provided no answer to this question we believe this occurred because the respondents believed they had previously provided the information comments provided by the respondents are quite informative we have addressed the issue for years  have strong curricular emphasis in this area revision not necessary  updating is going on each professor is academically and socially responsible for addressing this issue within framework of the courses all children and ya young adult literature courses currently integrate multicultural literature discussing revision of our international librarianship course to be a multicultural librarianship course discussing changing our advanced reference course to bibliographic instruction for diverse populations identify competencies or learner outsummerl

in search of multiculturolism in the library science curriculum  this is a very crude instrument which couldn possibly capture the complexity of this issue you didn ask good questions tsk tsk library and information science education statistical reports each annual statistical report of the association for library and information science education alise from the period   was examined for information on new courses courses dropped and experimental or trial courses in library science schools in the united states and canada the information is ambiguous as to whether courses dropped new courses added and experimental or trial courses contain a multicultural component or emphasis if the course title does not readily reflect a relevance to multiculturalism it is impossible to determine if the course concerns itself with the topic in any way for example courses entitled current trends in library and information information in society current trends or linguistics for information studies may indeed incorporate multiculturally related material the alise statistical reports while valuable do not help elucidate beyond a doubt the issue of the adoption of multiculturally related courses in library schools as such information is not specifically sought while our survey generally reflects increased awareness and inclusion of multicultural issues or topics in library science school courses the information obtained from the alise reports would appear to indicate relatively little progress in this regard for example of  new courses adopted in library schools between  and  only  courses  percent in american and four courses  percent in canadian library science schools can be easily identified as being related to multiculturalism regarding experimental or trial courses adopted in the library schools out of  such courses   percent seem to relate to multiculturalism for the same time period  courses have been dropped from library schools and   percent of those are believed to be multiculturally related because of inconsistencies in compilation and because no question directly asks about multiculturalism alise reports do not invalidate the results of our recent survey on multiculturalism and curriculum modifications or revisions in library schools conclusion it seems likely that for the remainder of this century the quality of colleges and universities may be gauged in part by the quality of life on the campuses themselves the changes that will occur on the campus will demand increasingly decisive high quality leadership on many fronts the acceptance of multiculturalism grows concomitantly but there is also a tension over its presence as a result to value diversity and embrace multiculturalism will require that its message be communicated to each entering class and to both new and continuing members of the academy including librarians and library staff as the remaining years of this decade present both unprecedented challenges to and new opportunities for higher education in an era of vast global changes librarians should play an active role after all librarianship has a historical precedent in dealing with the ethnic population in this country stephen stern has identified the role of the library community in a variety of ethnic and culturally diverse instances in our history for him the library community has always responded  summer
