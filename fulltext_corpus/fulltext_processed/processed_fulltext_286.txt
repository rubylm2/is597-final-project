using literature to teach in lis education a very good idea kate marek reports on the effectiveness of using fiction in graduate education come from a variety of disciplines and professional fields perhaps the best known is the writing of robert coles who speaks to the use of literature in educating doctors lawyers social workers and teachers but lis education has done little to explore the potential of teaching with literature in our own discipline suggesting first a theoretical framework to support the combination of both the cognitive and the affective in higher education this article goes on to report qualitative and quantitative findings that demonstrate the success of using fiction in lis education finally specific applications are suggested and described introduction if youe reading this chances are good that you are a reader asked what you wish you could do more of what you regret not doing and what you hope to spend your time doing in retirement reading will be at the top of your list many of us yearn to read  and frequently what we most yearn to read is quality literature why do we love to read there are many responses to that question both visceral if you will as well as answers grounded in research essentially we read to expand our experience it may be to escape into other worlds to meet new people to travel or to pretend but we broaden our horizons when we read we learn in this article i will argue that as educators of adults we have a tremendous opportunity to use literature to expand our students experience and i will argue in library and information science lis education where our students are ever more likely than the general population to be readers we miss the boat when we forget about the power of literature to teach the power of narrative itself not only for teaching but also within corporate practice has been well documented i take a somewhat different approach in this article however focusing on fiction and literature rather than on case study style narrative i will review theory from education and psychology that demonstrates the effectiveness of using literature for graduate note some portions of this paper were previously published as part of a phd dissertation catherine g marek the experience of using fiction for graduate professional education a phenomenological study phd diss emporia state university  i of education for library and information science vol  no spring    issn    association for library and information science education
using literature to teach in us education a very good idea  about the author kate marek is an associate professor at the graduate school of library and information science dominican university kmarekdomedu ms received  accepted  revised  education as well as educational theory that argues for learning through experience i will describe the results of qualitative and quantitative studies and i will offer specific examples of lis courses where literature is an especially effective teaching tool i will also refer to published accounts from other disciplines where literature is used in professional graduate education background reports on the effectiveness of using fiction in graduate education come from a variety of disciplines and professional fields perhaps the best known is the writing of robert coles who speaks to the use of literature in educating doctors lawyers social workers and teachers certainly there is no argument regarding the power of novels such as willa cather my antonia to teach about the complexity and richness of pioneer life in undergraduate liberal arts education literature is often used as a powerful teaching tool as evidenced in such initiatives as the great books curriculum at st john college but in the call of stories robert coles describes the power of fiction in teaching medical students about death from the perspective of human grief or about illness through the eyes of a terminally ill mother of preschoolers he also demonstrates the effectiveness of particular stories in teaching law students the finer points of human motivation and the consequences  intended and unintended  of the law he illustrates the power of story in teaching aspiring professional social workers about a life lived in poverty it is in teaching these philosophical points  issues of humanity values and ethics  as contrasted with the teaching of a profession clinical tools where literature is so useful and effective in the call of stories coles builds on the work of his mentor william carlos williams a medical doctor and a celebrated writer ultimately describing a series of examples of short stories and novels that coles has found effective in his teaching flannery oonnor story the lame shall enter first for example is a story coles uses with medical students to discuss the issue of a practitioner cognitive authority and a patient unexpected response with the introduction of a particular story such as this in class a discussion is generated that focuses on the characters it is this valuable discussion that takes education beyond memorization and analysis of the clinical
  journal of education for library and information science theoretical foundations robert coles speaks from his own experiences as he describes the effectiveness of using literature to teach professionals in an effort to strengthen the proposal for this pedagogy however it is also helpful to investigate theories of human thinking theories of human learning and writings from science which expand our thinking about the scientific methods of discovery to that end i will refer to the work of two scholars jerome bruner from the field of psychology and david kolb from education whose work provides a theoretical framework demonstrating the usefulness of using literature in teaching professional adults i will also highlight ideas from contemporary science writing which speak to the limits of the paradigmatic scientific method and celebrate the importance of intuition and imagination in the discovery process jerome bruner modes of thought jerome bruner a prominent american cognitive psychologist is a contemporary author who continues to research the relationship between cultural narrative and an individual ability to make meaning within his or her environment in acts of meaning bruner describes the mid th century revolution in psychology as an effort to establish meaning as the central concept in that discipline bruner contrasts folk psychology which he calls the psychology that dominates human interaction in daily life from psychology positivist paradigm that attempts to prepare for objective study by eliminating all aspects of the human mental state the organizing principle of folk psychology is narrative rather than conceptual according to bruner an important aspect of bruner work is his distinction between the narrative mode of thought and the logico scientific mode of thought the logico scientific mode of thought or paradigmatic mode as bruner normally refers to it is centered on mathematical and scientific systems tools for this mode of thinking include logic mathematics and the scientific method of hypothesis setting and experimentation bruner notes that the imaginative application of this mode of thinking leads to good theory tight analysis logical proof and empirical discovery guided by reasoned hypothesis however our preoccupation with science and indeed our infatuation with this mode of thought denies the rightful significance of another mode of thought bruner narrative mode it is this arena of what we know think or feel where narrative and specifically for this study fictional narrative can extend learning into greater depth and dimension fictional narrative is appropriate for the narrative mode of thought since fact and fiction have different roles in the logico scientific mode and the narrative mode representation of truth in the two modes of thought is very different in the paradigmatic mode the goal is to explain a phenomenon and to establish proof based on scientific testing truth in the narrative mode however is problematic and fuzzy
using literature to teach in us education a very good idea  in acts of meaning bruner describes the essential function of narrative in representing human reflective thought and in the construction of meaning ultimately bruner argues the tools of interpretation and narrative are essential to the task of meaning making in order to make sense of the world around us we must rely on symbols generated by the structure of a powerful narrative culture including myths stories poetry song and literature and while the logico scientific mode of thinking seeks to represent truth within a narrow positivistic view the narrative mode of thinking seeks to understand the broader question of the meaning of experience ultimately however even bruner discussion regarding the merits of appreciating dual ways of knowing  the logico scientific and the narrative  fails to acknowledge an important more complex way of understanding emergent thinking and discoveries that way of thinking is illustrated through the artistry of great scientific thinkers who explain the power of intuition and creative discovery as an essential part of the scientific method rather than an alternate competing process einstein stressed the role of intuition in scientific discovery to these elementary laws there leads no logical path but only intuition supported by being sympathetically in touch with experience evelyn fox keller biography of geneticist barbara mcclintock provides the framework for her investigation of the limits of the paradigmatic scientific method she describes the role of imagination and vision not only in mcclintock life and work but also in the work of saint thomas jean perrin robert millikan and albert einstein einstein was led to relativity by imagining emphasis mine the visual experience of a traveler on a beam of light we are familiar with the idea that a form of mysticism  a commitment to the unity of experience the oneness of nature the fundamental mystery underlying the laws of nature  plays an essential role in the process of scientific discovery einstein called it cosmic religiosity in turn the experience of creative insight reinforces these commitments fostering a sense of the limitations of the scientific method and an appreciation of other ways of knowing bruno latour a contemporary sociologist of science also emphasizes the multi dimensional nature of scientific thought he sees scientific discovery as socially constructed not happening in the isolation of a sterile laboratory as is the stereotypical understanding of the ideal method but rather as a multi layered process that cannot be separated from the scientist life experience and culture roald hoffmann does a wonderful job of addressing story as an essential component of science going so far as to conceptualize alternate scientific hypotheses as competing narratives again albert einstein is used as a classic example of a scientist whose thinking scientific process and writing all demonstrate the presence of imagination and story in the building of theory using einstein groundbreaking  paper on the photoelectric effect hoffman demonstrates einstein technique of building
  journal of education for library and information science theory through compelling storytelling a young man of  einstein had mastered the old stories in this paper he combined the ways others looked at the world and trusting analogy as much as mathematics made something new science is an inspired account of the struggle by human beings to understand the world changing it in the process how could this be anything but a story einstein and mcclintock are examples of scientists who also depended heavily on their own experience whether it was through imaginative experience or life experience to help them move forward in conceptualizing new discoveries an emphasis on experience in learning was advanced in th century educational theory through the groundbreaking work of john dewey in his experience and education dewey presented the field of education with a compilation of his thinking on the importance of adding human reflection and thought to the then popular recitation method of teaching and learning his revolutionary work provided a springboard for ongoing investigation of the power of learning through experience it is this broader question of the meaning of experience specifically in our case as vicariously represented through fictional narrative which prepares us for investigating the pedagogical uses of fiction in professional education i will use the work of educational psychologist david kolb to extend this theory base most specifically his theory of experiential learning david kolb theory of experiential learning david kolb has developed a theory of experiential learning which is relevant to this discussion for a variety of reasons kolb reviewed the work of john dewey as well as that of jean piaget and kurt lewin and his resulting theory has elements of each of these philosophers while extending and modifying their ideas kolb theory of experiential learning can be adapted directly to the use of fiction in the classroom kolb diagram of experiential learning is presented here as figure  the model demonstrates the interaction between the individual personal development education and work this interaction shown in the model of a circle moving between the three points of personal experience creates experiential learning kolb defines learning as the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience by combining two forms of prehension apprehension and comprehension and two methods of transforming that prehension extension and intention kolb reveals four different forms of knowledge accommodative knowledge divergent knowledge convergent knowledge and assimilative knowledge kolb emphasizes that learning requires both a grasp or a representation of experiences as well as some transformation of that representation it is this interactive process that produces learning it is my contention that the use of literature can provide learning experiences which fit the description of various categories of learning according
using literature to teach in us education a very good idea  figure  kolb experiential learning process to kolb depending on how the story is presented and discussed in the class it can be argued variously reading a story provides a learning experience focused on comprehension or through reliance on conceptual interpretation and symbolic representation or that it is a learning experience through apprehension where experience is through reliance on the tangible felt qualities of immediate experience a likely scenario for the use of literature in higher education would include a cycle of individual reading individual reflection large group or small group discussion with some concrete instruction and continued individual reflection at various levels of this cycle the student would be engaged at all levels of kolb experiential learning cycle depending on the level and intensity of the story as well as the amount of informational connections to the content of the class curriculum clearly there is a theoretical justification for the power of story and for reading literature as a valid learning tool therefore it is appropriate to examine the specific kinds of curricular opportunities theory tells us we can best stimulate with literature fiction as pedagogy while paul hirst describes the necessity of using different methods to study different types of curriculum subjects it is also important to remember that as dewey and others tell us meaning is constructed through a cornpersonal development   experiential     learning j  education work
  journal of education for library and information science plex variety of methods and processes literature is an important tool for moral understanding many educators speak to the difference between the cognitive and the affective and educating toward both realms is critical dorothy walsh has investigated the subject of literature as knowledge walsh looks at the definitions of knowledge and includes experience as an element of that definition literature she says offers opportunities to expand experience other words and phrases walsh uses to describe what literature offers the reader are illumination realization epiphany heightened understanding and revelatory insight bruner argument regarding the role of narrative is consistent with this description by walsh where she celebrates literature unique ability to convey something more than something beyond the actual articulation of information louise rosenblatt speaks specifically to the topic of using literature in education to help foster the society needed for a successful democracy exposure to other people and other cultures through stories helps american students see parts of the bigger picture in addition students need experiences which can help them consider various sides to an issue and make reasoned decisions reading literature rosenblatt writes can provide those experiences and develop those skills literature she argues therefore very much belongs not only in the english curriculum but also in the social science curriculum and beyond robert coles brought to life the idea of using literature in higher education and particularly in professional graduate programs such as law and medicine while he was certainly not the first author to publish on this topic his successful book made the topic more accessible and timely in educational environments where so much effort is spent on the development of the intellect coles provides a rationale for also expanding the emotional and humanitarian aspects of the mind he speaks of the moral aspects of the professions by which he means the ability to grapple with questions of conscience and responsibility based on an understanding of the human dimensions of life confronted in daily work fiction coles argues brings those moral and emotional issues to life and provides a unique way to learn more about life a good portion of the call of stories describes in depth specific works of fiction and how they were used in the classroom to provide a particular vicarious experience for the students or to set the stage for a discussion of ethical issues faced by the story characters he includes instances of student responses from the classes to more fully describe the learning experience coles truly champions the idea of using fiction to extend the students experiences through literature offering the complexities of life up for discussion and reflection the characters met in fiction stay in the mind of the reader living with her in daily experience the whole point of stories is not olutions or esolutions but a broadening and even a heightening of our struggles    stories coles says offer us a unique way to extend our understanding of ourselves and our life experiences expanding the intellect and the emotions

  journal of education for library and information science analysis process outlined by clark moustakas phenomenology as a research paradigm which seeks to reveal and describe the essence of an experience proved to be an excellent approach to understanding more about the power of literature to teach in the professions the moustakas methodology calls for in depth interviews which are transcribed and analyzed according to a systematic method of reduction and description the overall goal is to discover the essential elements of the experience or its essence the researcher own experience is bracketed in an attempt to eliminate bias after preliminary analysis of the in depth interviews the researcher writes a composite description of the transcripts and identifies clusters of meanings which lead to final identification of core themes and essences of the experience the analysis process revealed the following core themes of the students experience  characters  the participants established personal relationships with the characters from fiction which enhanced learning on a variety of levels and extended experience  connections  the participants experienced connections between fiction and real life and they expressed the ability of fiction to help make strong linkages between theory and practice  emotions  well written fiction is vivid and emotional which the participants described as being beneficial to their learning experience for a variety of reasons the fiction touched the minds and hearts of the students at a depth beyond what purely informational material could reach  enjoyment  many students enjoy reading fiction in general and the experience of reading fiction for class was also very fun again this was a benefit to learning  discussion  the discussion in the classroom provides for a framework exposes and explores the connections to the course materials and reveals a variety of nuances to the students reactions to the texts  learning  deeper  longer lasting combining the qualities of the experience already mentioned results in a deeper and more multidimensional learning experience  these core themes provide compelling positive support for using fiction in lis education each of these six core aspects of the students experience as revealed in this study has been suggested and described in the scholarship of teaching literature from various disciplines as previously referenced and the subsequent surveys in this study also confirm these findings in addition this specific qualitative study has been further enhanced with numeric data from surveys administered to three subsequent groups of students a simple survey was distributed to each group as a part of the final class session evaluation materials in two cases the course was a regular
