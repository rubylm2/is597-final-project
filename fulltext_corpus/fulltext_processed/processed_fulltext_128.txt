because the information science that evolved in the last years of the twentieth century constitutes an arena of study in which the technology to which it is harnessed defines the field i argued in a  library quarterly article library and information studies lis lacked a solid body of scholarship that critically analyzes the multiple roles that libraries of all types have played and are playing in their host communities one gets the impression of a profession trapped in its own discursive formations i hypothesized where members speak mostly to each other and where connections between power and knowledge that affect issues of race class age and gender among others are either invisible or ignored one also gets the impression of a profession much more interested in process and structure than in people the result is i concluded a professional discourse and a research base characterized by tunnel vision and blind spots wiegand   fifteen years have passed since that article was published and to examine the validity of its conclusions for the present day i decided to use my newly published book part of our lives a peoples history of the american public library as a test case wiegand  my research question was simple from a historical perspective why do americans love their public libraries it is an indisputable fact that they do evidence to support this abounds first there is the rhetoric the three most important documents a free society gives wrote author e l doctorow in  are a birth certificate a passport and a library card quoted in hadad  right here in this room pulitzer prizewinning historian david mccullough said as he swept his arm around the auditorium of tulsas central library in  we are at dead center in the absolute heart of the best institution in our society quoted in walker  the america i loved still exists said kurt vonnegut in  if not in the white house or the supreme court or the senate or the house of representatives or the media the america i love still exists at the front desks of our public libraries vonnegut   then there is the research a  report by the pew research centers internet and american life project for example noted that in the previous decade every other major institution government churches banks corporations has fallen in public esteem except libraries the military and first responders the study also found that  of those surveyed over the age of  said libraries are very or somewhat important to their communities and  identified their public library experience as very positive or mostly positive another pew study found that  of parents believe libraries are important for their children  said because libraries develop a love of reading and books pew internet and american life project  although three decades ago many evangelists of information technology predicted the demise of public libraries by the turn of the century as of this writing their numbers have not dropped in fact in  the united states had  public libraries including branches and bookmobiles although the number of visits had declined slightly in  to  billion likely because a recession forced public libraries to reduce hours of opening by  and more patrons checked out library e books from their home computers the decade nonetheless showed an increase of  in  libraries also offered  million programs circulation showed gains in  public libraries circulated  billion items including audio and video materials and print and e booksa  increase from  institute for museum and library services  although statistics show that americans use their public libraries heavily the statistics do not explain why despite the fact that as a nationwide phenomenon the american public library has been strongly identified with the national ethos of equality of educational opportunity note redmond kathleen molz and phyllis dain it is still hard to prove that american public libraries are essential to democracythe cornerstone of the narrative the profession uses to justify their existence for the most part the public librarys alumni are anonymous invisible and unenlisted says historian daniel j boorstin and given the almost totally voluntary nature of public library usage argue molz and dain it is hard to counter his descriptors the kinds of aggregate statistics assembled by schools and colleges  elude the library profession leaving lis dependent on anecdotal accounts and largely input oriented statistics which simply cannot quantify the impact of public library service on the public government officials sometimes criticize librarians for their soft data but lacking the kind of data schools and colleges generate to measure performance any other approach seems unlikely molz and dain  ix  part of our lives is an attempt to bolster the soft data by tracing the american public librarys history not so much by analyzing the words of its founders and managers but mostly by listening to the voices of its users to identify my perspective i shamelessly plagiarize two phrases used by my former university of wisconsinmadison colleague doug zweizig in his  dissertation rather than analyzing the user in the life of the librarya top down view that largely mirrors lis discoursepart of our lives adopts a bottom up library in the life of the user perspective that allows me to follow the example of howard zinn whose pioneering a peoples history of the united states zinn  takes this approach it also invites me to feature in my narrative the voices of generations of public library users as a humanist i am most concerned with what andrew piper calls the production of subjectivity or what it means to be a person in the world piper   i want to offer a historical analysis of how the public library has contributed to that process largely because of recent technologies uncovering these voices was easy some are in published memoirs autobiographies and biographies of the famous some in manuscript collections and public library archives across the country the vast majority however are fixed in hundreds of us newspapers and periodicals digitized since the s into huge easily searchable databases by using public library as a search term i found thousands of voices in letters to the editor and thousands more quoted in stories written by reporters about their local libraries as i analyzed the data i was surprised at how quickly the evidence was organized history shows i argue that the reasons americans have loved their public libraries fit into three main categories  for the useful information they made accessible  for the public space they provided and  for the reading materials they circulated that helped users make sense of phenomena in the world around them this discovery also dictated my approach and led me to employ three literatures to highlight my findings information the first i inherited from library and information studiesthe professional discourse in which i have worked all my adult life and which until recently governed my own approach to american library history what do i mean by discourse most scholars trace the concept to french philosopher michel foucault and as wikipedia explains humanities and social science scholars in particular harnessed this concept to describe not only a cultures formal way of thinking that can be expressed through language but also a social boundary that defines what can be said about a specific topic discourse  in many respects a professional discourse functions like a big intellectual sandboxplenty of room to play with ideas but one nonetheless with limits a social boundaryin which leaders employ a formal way of thinking to educate and enlighten members of a profession who implement what they learn to improve service for the publics greater benefit for public libraries that translates into the services they institute and maintain and the collections spaces and resources they make accessible the roots of contemporary lis discourse trace back to benjamin franklin whose first order of books for the new library company of philadelphia in  emphasized useful knowledge but ignored fiction lyons  by the time the american colonies declared their independence in  western nations were rapidly industrializing under capitalism unlike their rural counterparts industrial workers found their day divided not by sunrise and sunset and their year not by seasons but by a clock their employers used to determine when work occurred to capitalists work time was always more important than nonwork time which evolved its own set of descriptors including leisure capitalists consistently privileged useful knowledge generated to improve work above any information considered to be leisure libraries serving the information interests of business and government naturally mirrored these priorities western states operating with capitalist economies also privileged work information but to that added public information and stories the state regarded so essential to the social order that they constituted a canon of relevant literature fiction and nonfiction to be communicated to citizens and taught in schools and colleges libraries serving state interests also collected and preserved these kinds of public information and stories thus by the midnineteenth century when boston public library founders funders and managers developed an institutional set of goals and objectives we now call a mission statement it was based on their cultural priorities and a set of library traditions they inherited that celebrated useful knowledge grounded on a belief shared with thomas jefferson that democracy could not exist without informed citizens the founders rationalized the existence of public libraries as essential to creating that citizenry ever since in the professions rhetoric one component of its discourse public libraries have been depicted largely as neutral agencies whose primary responsibility is to make accessible the kinds of information thought essential to democracyitself a legacy of the enlightenments faith in the power of knowledge the vast majority of library history literature that i inherited addresses the mission statement as historical fact and uses that discoursean orthodoxy fixed in the professions literatureto describe the institutions history largely through the words of public library founders and managers although jesse shera recognized that the library is distinctly a social phenomenon and as such is susceptible to all the influences that react upon our social structure shera   he also argued in his widely cited foundations of the public library that the modern public library in large measure represents the need of democracy for an enlightened electorate and its history records its adaptation to changing social requirements shera  vi sidney ditzion titled his analysis of the nineteenth century public library arsenals of a democratic culture ditzion  wayne bivens tatum nicely summarizes the evolution of this professional discourseand the debates taking place within this particular intellectual sandboxin libraries and the enlightenment bivens tatum  as i discovered in previous research however in the late nineteenth century the emerging profession of librarianship adopted that mission statement as a professional imperative and through its discursive formations constructed a unique set of practices eg cataloging and classification reference collection development and management of the institution and the tools to support them eg the dewey decimal classification booklist magazine fiction catalog that separated it from other professions forming about the same time american public library history literature builds on these assumptions and largely chronicles this evolution with a top down focus that concentrates on particular libraries the biographies of library organizers managers and donors the growth and development of collections over time and professionalized activities such as reference cataloging and classification and services to youth thus library history literature replicates and echoes the professions discourse by the first decade of the twenty first century this discourse had isolated primarily on information as the professions formal way of thinking thus imposing a social boundary within library and information studies on what can be said about a specific topic these parameters are evident for example in the steadily decreasing number of dissertations written since  that contain library keywords in their title thus demonstrating general empirical support for the long held anecdotal assertions that libraries are no longer the primary research focus at the doctoral level of lis finlay et al   ironically however the same lis experts so enamored of newer information technologies that they predicted the public librarys demise were still steeped in a professional discourse that privileged the stories and information that state and cultural authorities found essential and prioritized the information that capitalism thought useful by making it all more accessible admittedly american public library history abounds in examples that comfortably fit the category of information as lis currently defines it while sitting at a cincinnati public library desk in  for example thomas edison compiled a bibliography on electricity israel   many times edison would get excused from duty under pretense of being too sick to work a contemporary recalled in  and invariably strike a beeline for the library where he would spend the entire day and evening reading  such works on electricity as were to be had a night with edison   by the time i was twelve or fourteen harry truman said i had read every book in the public library including the encyclopedias  those books had a great influence on me truman   in  wilbur and orville wright came upon an ornithology book in the dayton public library that rekindled their interest in human flight howard   in   year old barack obama returned to honolulu from jakarta the first place i wanted to be was in a library he later recalled often he had a specific information need one saturday   with the help of a raspy voiced old librarian who appreciated my seriousness i found a book on east africa obama wanted information about kenya birthplace of his father a luo tribe member the luo raised cattle and lived in mud huts and ate corn meal and yams and something called millet the book said their traditional costume was a leather thong across the crotch shocked by what he read obama left the book open faced on a table and walked out without thanking the librarian obama   but my historical research shows that information is only one of the reasons americans have loved their public libraries because people do not have to use it the american public library is a unique civic institution to attract patrons founders and managers had no choice but to allow the public to influence the process of defining what this civic institution would become lis discourse however does not address in any comprehensive way the library in the life of the user and thus denied me additional opportunities to deepen my understanding of why americans loved their public libraries from that perspective the word information as we use it in contemporary lis discourse certainly has historical roots but because of the poverty of liss professional vocabulary it is also greatly limited in its ability to explain what my research was uncovering about library as place and the power of the reading patrons obtained from public libraries by the billions over the years so to explain my findings in records teeming with examples of users whose lives were changed and shaped by the american public library my challenge became how to expand beyond the professional discourse how to see outside the limits of liss sandbox of ideas and how to craft a theoretical framework that accommodates explains and enfranchises the voices of library users i uncovered in my research two literatures that took root outside lis discourseironically about the time the information priesthood was predicting the public librarys turn of the century demisespeak directly to library as place and the power of commonplace reading to transform lives in part of our lives i rely heavily on each library as place at the atlanta public librarys african american sweet auburn branchone of the few places in atlantas s segregated society where blacks felt safe and welcomedirector annie watters recalled one summer when  year old martin luther king jr came to the library many times during the week she later recorded their interactions he would walk up to the desk and  look me straight in the eye hello martin luther she would respond always calling him by his first and middle names whats on your mind oh nothing particularly for watters that was the cue that king had learned a new big word and they then initiated a conversation in which king used the word repeatedly another game involved poetry again king would stand by the desk waiting whats on your mind martin luther watters asked for i dipped into the future far as the human eye could see he responded watters immediately recognized the poem and finished the verse for i dipped into the future far as the human eye could see saw a vision of the world and the wonders that would be mcpheeters   when the cincinnati public library opened a piano room in  among its first visitors was a  year old jimmy levine as he wrote his name in pencil on the rooms sign up sheet eight visits later he changed his signature to j levine and finally james levine when he gave a concert for  children in the childrens room in  he had already performed as a cincinnati symphony soloist as of this writing he is the new york metropolitan operas artistic director fleischman    in  the gary indiana public library sponsored a local talent contest at which a group soon to be known as the jackson five competed although they didnt win little michael was an audience favorite bornstein  in  the washington post carried an article by eric wee that focused on a district of columbia branch library in one of washingtons poorest neighborhoods wee reported that every tuesday night a homeless man named conrad cheek entered the library and set up his chessboard on one of the tables in the childrens room wee immediately noticed a transformation no more ignored pleas for this homeless man no averted glances during the next hour people will look him in the eye theyll listen to his words in this down at the heels library hes the teacher among his students was  year old ali osman as wee watched this interaction alis mother explained that her sons confidence had soared after playing with conrad that he was now bragging to friends about being a chess player we owe it all to mr conrad his mother said we love him wee reported that inside the library they call him mr conrad wee  all these very meaningful experiences occurred in a place we call library to categorize them as information gathering however fails to capture their significance in the lives of each of these individuals so to ground my analysis of library as place i had to turn to a second sandbox of ideasa scholarly literature often labeled public sphere that wikipedia defines as that area in social life where individuals can come together to freely discuss and identify societal problems and through that discussion influence political action public sphere  jürgen habermasthe concepts pioneering guruargues that during the eighteenth century the growing middle classes sought to influence government actions by assuming control of an emerging public sphere of deliberation that found an influential niche between forces exercised by governments and marketplaces within this public sphere people created their own institutions and sites and in them articulated a discourse reflecting a public interest governments and markets dared not ignore habermas  once habermas laid the theoretical groundwork others began analyzing institutions and sites where groups not primarily concerned with political ideologies or marketplace activities practiced this discourse out of these analyses a refined concept of the role of public space as place emerged in civic institutions such as libraries for example people routinely exchange social capitala common phrase in public sphere thinking these institutions also provide spaces that help people develop a tolerance of and appreciation for differences and enable them to engage in what henry jenkins calls participatory culture by having low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement strong support for creating and sharing with others and information mentorship whereby experienced participants pass along knowledge to novices jenkins observes members of a participatory culture believe their contributions matter and have some degree of social connection with one another jenkins   within public sphere thinking i also like james gees concept of affinity spacesin twenty first century america semiotic social spaces that people self select and find comfortable and in which they interact based on their own choices purposes and identities gee says users and occupants of affinity spaces can each get different things out of the space affinity spaces he argues are an important form of social affiliation today places where effective learning occurs outside institutions of formal education gee   i especially like this concept because it deepens our understanding and complicates the meaning of a third place a term coined by ray oldenburg that many librarians have adopted to explain library as place oldenburg  more than a third place chip ward argues the public libraryas a place where dissent is respected tolerance is shown and open minded behaviors are modeledis the civic commons that contains the cultural commons in all its wide ranging diversity ward   but because public libraries also function as institutions in a robust civic commons that spreads across communities services provided outside the librarys central physical space have become an important part of the mix since the s librarianship has referred to these services as outreacha term of professional discourse that assumes from a user in the life of the library perspective a civic institutions service center and periphery and a word that helps explain why libraries tend to favor services at the center as higher priorities during budget crunches smallwood  that users see outreach from a different center is evident every time an urban public library system attempts to close branches and reduce outreach services in tough economic times for part of our lives i adopt the vocabulary of public sphere literaturepublic interest exchange social capital participatory culture and civic commonsto narrate the history of the american public library as place its easy to see the public library as a player in this theoretical framework generations of users demonstrated that they valued the public library as a place by voluntarily visiting it again and again in fact for many americans visiting a public library constituted the first place in the public sphere where they enjoyed adult privileges and by obtaining a public library card as a child formally accepted a civic responsibility to respect public property although this literature offers much to address my research question it lives outside lis discourse and with a few exceptions has largely escaped the attention of lis researchers buschman and leckie  only in recent years has the library profession begun counting on a national level the number of people attending library programs or listing library exhibits in public library space and only recently have researchers surveyed users as consumers of library space to determine perceived need at the same time however lis research has seldom attempted to measure how library spaces function as agents in the interactions of public library users as individuals or as members of larger groups in order to see what and how much they learned yet from a library in the life of the user perspective knowing how and why patrons used library space and what they learned there formally and informally is essential to understanding why americans love their public libraries reading to explain the reading of stories contemporary information discourse viewed from the top down tends to look at readers as passive recipients of the messages authors locate in printed texts it also often harnesses metaphors that have dominated library rhetoric for generations for example reading is often considered like a ladder readers are expected to elevate their reading tastes by climbing from lower to higher forms of literature as judged by those who claim authority to distinguish between the two or reading is like eating where overindulgence in its less desirable forms again determined by people claiming authority to know what these are is assumed to effect harm made obvious in use of words such as escape and addiction ross  the most enduring example of this mind set is the professions traditional attitudes toward series fiction for youth if youthful public library patrons did not improve such literatures should be discouraged youth librarians often argued through its discursive professional practices bibliographies such as booklist and fiction catalog and childrens catalog the library community consistently encouraged its users to adhere to the moral authority of learned professions but users had other ideas because they did not have to use public libraries users automatically applied pressures public library managers could not ignore by force of demandvox populiusers insisted that their public libraries acquire particular kinds of stories as a result they effectively shaped the library into a popular place that addressed their literary tastes within limits acceptable to the communitythe public library performs an important community service by helping to mediate these limitsthey eventually defined a style of literacy that helped them make sense of their worlds stories are interactive and constitute recipes for the imagination richard nash writes they are born and thrive in the swirl and giggle of idea and style and know no particular home among textual forms nash   like reading whether printed or electronic text the acts of listening and viewing bring with them the same story sharing benefits transmedia stories henry jenkins argues are at the most basic level  stories told across multiple media although a cultures core stories are captured in different cultural media drama art music literature and different cultural forms books periodicals films recordings the latter may change over time jenkins   if you watch television go to the movies read popular magazines and look at advertisements argues richard keller simon you are exposed to many of the same kinds of stories as someone who studies the great books of western civilization you have simply been encouraged to look at them differently simon   media cannot be isolated analytically from one another ted striphas argues relationships among media are socially produced and historically contingent rather than given and necessary they rarely if ever share one dimensional causal relationships striphas   american public libraries have always played a primary role in making transmedia stories accessible to millions of users ever since the boston public library opened in  fiction ie stories consistently averaged between  and  of materials circulated every generation of public library users insisted on stories containing messages good and bad that they wanted to hear a century and a half later as statistics cited earlier show they still do albeit in increasingly different cultural forms for most patrons of all ages stories have always been the oxygen of public library services when the library profession organized in the late nineteenth century however dominant groupsbusiness government and cultural authorities who assumed responsibility for educating the next generationcelebrated the learned reading they modeled and consistently trivialized as a leisure activity the stories people wanted most no matter their cultural form as a result librarians were made uncomfortable about supplying the kinds of stories contained in commonplace reading that less powerful groups wanted but to justify funding library managers also had to monitor circulation numbers as a measure of use and thus had to address the leisure needs of public library users through demand alone the latter forced public library funders and managers to accommodate their cultural priorities at some public libraries they were more successful than others over time especially in the twentieth century librarians developed a willingness to serve if not always to endorse the democracies of culture evident in multiple cultural tastes although they did this without much fanfare or gratitude from cultural authorities their professional services not only enabled millions of users to construct multiple canons unique to their own cultures but also freed them from the prescriptions of authorities whose own knowledge was hardly disinterested in fact loyalty to their own stories that grounded their own knowledge communities often constituted a form of protest against these prescriptions but beyond arguing that users as taxpayers had a right to their stories within acceptable community standards beyond satisfying peoples leisure needs in order to get them in the door or in the twenty first century beyond advocating for voluntary reading exemplified by posters of famous people on thousands of public library walls admonishing viewers to read with but few exceptions pawley  beard and thi beard  dali  lis discourse seldom analyzes why stories are essential to the everyday interactions millions of public library users have with social peersalmost as if it is none of the professions business to understand why people love their public libraries however i argue that it is the professions business for most of american public library history those stories have appeared in print and a major print containerone that preoccupied lis discourse through the late twentieth centuryhas been the book because i wanted to know why americans love their public libraries i was not much concerned with the book as object instead i focus more on how the stories carried by books function as agents in the everyday lives of public library users and in particular i concentrate on the commonplace reading libraries supplied which i here define as everything not learned reading including the reading of publications such as police gazette national enquirer romances westerns comics and pornography showing how patrons interacted with the commonplace reading materials public libraries supplied over the generations not only demonstrates that these stories have been transformative for readers but also reveals how public libraries helped define the acceptable boundaries of a communitys literary and cultural valuesboundaries that public libraries sometimes publicly mediated but more often intuitively recognized on the basis of traditions and demand they inherited from a communitys previous generation of public library users stories that passed from oral to manuscript and then into print cultures were humankinds attempts to explain phenomena in the surrounding world for most they constitute pedagogies of daily life carrying codes of behavior and having great potential to stir fundamental emotions and foster a sense of unity once these stories were fixed in print to assimilate them one either had to read or be read to thus understanding behaviors encompassing the act and the social nature of reading the stories that people get from their public libraries is essential if we are to understand why they love these ubiquitous civic institutions to explain this i harness a third sandbox of ideasa humanistic literature on the subject of reading that allows me to see stories less as objects which is how librarianship has traditionally treated them and more as agents in the everyday lives of american public library users several texts are germinal janice radways reading the romance women patriarchy and popular literature is an ethnographic case study describing how romance stories always highly popular in public libraries willing to circulate them functioned as agents in the everyday interactions of suburban women in the late s radway demonstrates the multiple ways in which these women used their reading to claim mental space and to escapeif only temporarilythe demands of being wife and mother many of her findings complicate the definition of escapefar beyond the simplistic definition the word carries in liss lexicon radway  benedict andersons imagined communities reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism has been equally influential people organize themselves into large and small imagined communities he argues to orient and affiliate with each other cultural texts of all kinds function as agents to help construct these imagined communities by providing common sets of experiences including the reading of shared stories anderson adds another dimension to the sociability of readingsometimes this reading and story sharing takes place in groups on public property and in cultural spacescultural spaces such as public libraries i would add anderson  story sharing works in many ways for example in view of readings extraordinary capacity for opening up imaginative experience argues reading historian james l machor the world of print may in fact have been one of the few places where people of different classes and culture could encounter one another across boundaries boundaries of imagination if no other machor  reading is more than the consumption of stories it is also communion with others no matter the vehicle of communication says literary historian gillian silverman story reading continues to occasion an escape from the confines of limited subjectivity allowing us like our nineteenth century forebears to invest in forms of oneness with each other silverman   reading is never purely an act of isolation argues andrew piper when we read we enter into a world of commonality whether of language story or material object in serving as a space to lose ones sense of place reading cultivates a sense of intimacy at the same time that it socializes the reader piper     in book clubs women and the uses of reading in everyday life elizabeth long analyzes readings capacity to stimulate imagination construct community through shared meaning and demonstrate moral achievement in the free will act of reading long argues readers move into and out of the text and thus appropriate meaning relevant to their own lives because readers can control it the act of reading stories becomes dependably pleasurable empowering intellectually stimulating and socially bonding and it is in the act of reading stories that social and cultural acts of defiancesometimes overt sometimes covert sometimes conscious sometimes subconscioustake place if cultural authorities lack the power to check commonplace reading for an interpretation they determine is legitimate readers can and do construct their own meanings sometimes as groups sometimes as individuals long   reading also occurs within a social framework of received opinion meanings depend on the interactions among readers texts and environments argues book historian barbara sicherman they are constructed through the practices of communities of readers and refracted through individuals how one reads as well as what and with whom are of central importance to the enterprise even to the act of interpretation unlike the ideology of learned reading grounding formal education the institutional study of literature and the culture of intellectuals however commonplace reading by design has emotional impact sicherman   fictional narrative has its impact primarily through emotions argues psychologist keith oatley once emotional engagement occurs in contexts of understanding reading can be transformative and affect a persons whole identity oatley    this is especially true for youth developmental psychologists suggest that the stories found in fiction are so appealing because they relate to issues in readers lives in emotionally powerful ways notes sicherman starting even before they can read fiction helps boys and girls sort out and control their fears and desires in fantasy work out their relationships to the world through identification with hero or heroine gain insight into the meaning of life and later develop analytic thinking sicherman   anne haas dyson shows how reading superhero comics bonds youthful readers in play because they know the stories and understand the genre they share a frame of reference that identifies their social roles and the rules of social interactions by adopting these roles and following these rules they know how to connect with people around them dyson  one reason cultural authorities objected so vehemently to series fiction in the twentieth century deirdre johnson argues is that it gave young people agency in a way canonical literature did not traditionally in the more acceptable childrens literature of the period adults give children necessary advice and impose restraints on them in series fiction however adolescents make their own crucial decisions she notes they demonstrate intelligence capability and freedom from adults in violation of this tradition children not adults become the moral arbiters and shapers of their fate they willingly enter the adult world and compete on an even footingfantasy certainly but one that appeals to almost every child johnson   emily hamilton honey argues that in the pages of series fiction children act like adults make responsible decisions under their own power and have voices and opinions that are often ignored in real life series books give young men and women a chance to make choices about who they wanted to be what they wanted to do with their lives outside of adult authority honey   while not directly connected to humanistic reading literature recent neuroscientific research has demonstrated how narrative activates particular parts of the brain including the sensory and motor cortexes in her summary of this research annie murphy paul notes the brain it seems does not make much of a distinction between reading about an experience and encountering it in real life in each case the same neurological regions are stimulated one researcher she reports found that fiction offered readers the opportunity to enter fully into other peoples thoughts and feelings another saw substantial overlap in the brain networks used to understand stories and the networks used to navigate interactions with other individuals in particular interactions in which were trying to figure out the thoughts and feelings of others other researchers suggest that reading fiction is an exercise that hones our real life social skills and that regular fiction readers seem to be better able to understand other people empathize with them and see the world from their perspective fiction notes keith oatley is a particularly useful simulation because negotiating the social world effectively is extremely tricky requiring us to weigh up myriad interacting instances of cause and effect just as computer simulations can help us get to grips with complex scientific problems  so novels stories and dramas can help us understand the complexities of social life paul  a recent study by washington universitys dynamic cognition laboratory shows that fiction readers mentally simulate each new situation encountered in a narrative  details about actions and sensations are captured from the text and integrated with personal knowledge from past experiences nicole speer the studys lead researcher notes that the brain regions that fiction activates closely mirror those involved when people perform imagine or observe similar real world activities speer et al   other research analyzing differences in the act of reading digital media and printed material suggests that when reading text on the internet or on a smart phone readers tend to lose concentration and read superficially not so with the printed texts that contain stories however which apparently foster closer reading and enhance concentration myung bok  escape imagined communities appropriate reading as social practice validate existence socialized through reading these words and phrases now function as part of a new vocabulary within the humanistic reading literature to explain how reading stories helps construct community even if the act of reading is done in solitude in order to find reasons why people love their public libraries humanistic reading literature offers much it reveals how complex and deeply meaningful the act of story sharing is and for centuries has been the importance this observation has for understanding the role public libraries have played by providing access to the stories in commonplace reading that their users have checked out by the billions over the generations is incalculable in public library history examples abound in glendale california marion morrison later known as john wayne spent hours reading in the solitude of the library in the s his biographers note losing himself and his troubles in romantic adventures such as zane grey novels and biographies of kit carson buffalo bill and jim bridger roberts and olson   about the same time in dixon illinois young ronald reagan visited his public library twice a week mostly to check out frank merriwell stories tarzan novels and books by horatio alger zane grey arthur conan doyle and mark twain many of which he read on the librarys front steps im a sucker for hero worship he later admitted griswold  and in grand rapids michigan a young gerald ford read every alger novel he could find to achieve one must have goals and be well organized he recalled  years later husted  in a  interview  year old pete seeger recalled an early life reading experience at age  a librarian saw that i could read fairly well and recommended me a book written for teenagers  the one i got was rolf in the woods seton  about a teenager who runs away from his stepfatherwhos beating himand is adopted by a middle aged indian whose tribe was massacred and whose wife was sold into slavery and is living alone that he remembered this so vividly eight decades after reading it is testimony to the power of commonplace reading and in seegers case a new york times editor noted upon his death in  fitting for someone who went on to engage issues of conscience seegers heavy reading  for oprah winfrey reading stories became an open door for freedom in my life and allowed me to see that there was a world beyond my grandmothers front porch in mississippi that everybody didnt have an outhouse that everybody wasnt surrounded by poverty that there was a hopeful world out there and that it could belong to me to winfrey reading became her comfort her solace to commune with and learn something about myself to learn something about other people to learn something about the world oprah on the fire for reading at the aap   in a small milwaukee apartment she shared as a  year old in  with her half brother and half sister she read a tree grows in brooklynher first all night bookthe story of francie nolan whose life was full of humiliation and whose only friends were in books lining the public library shelves  i felt like my life was hers seven years later winfrey read maya angelous i know why the caged bird sings i read it over and over i had never before read a book that validated my own existence johnson   after her father died in   year old sonia sotomayor buried herself in reading at her bronx library and the apartment she shared with her mother and brother nancy drew had a powerful hold on my imagination she remembered every night when id finished reading and got into bed and closed my eyes i would continue the story with me in nancys shoes until i fell asleep her mind she noted worked in ways very similar to nancys i was a keen observer and listener i picked up on clues i figured things out logically and i enjoyed puzzles i loved the clear focused feeling that came when i concentrated on solving a problem and everything else faded out her reading that summer she admitted was her solace and only distraction that got her through this time of trouble sotomayor   conclusions part of our lives attempts to give information place and reading equal attention by harnessing core ideas from three literatures and focusing them on the history of the american public library in the life of the user in order to answer the question why do americans love their public library the book shows that for more than a century and a half the information reading and places that public libraries provided helped fuse diverse groups into communities large and small imagined and real and gave millions of individuals a sense of belonging after going through the data for this book from a bottom up perspective i come away with a new appreciation for this civic institution which because it built a tremendous record of achievement serving people who used it in so many different ways deserves much more credit than it has heretofore been given if the research i did for part of our lives is accurate however then i also have to conclude that liss traditional discourse and current research agenda do not have the capacity to identify manyperhaps even mostof the contributions american public libraries make to their communities for example the history i see suggests that increased support for american public libraries will not necessarily lead to a more informed citizenry there i did itdirectly challenged the cornerstone of the narrative librarians use to justify support of these ubiquitous civic institutions at the beginning of the twenty first century communications scholars michael x delli carpini and scott keeter noted that the mean level of knowledge among americans is about the same today as it was fifty years ago a half century earlier less than half and in many cases less than a quarter of the public  knew definitions of key terms such as liberal conservative primary elections or the bill of rights  had knowledge of many individual and collective rights guaranteed by the constitution  recognized the names of public figures below the level of president or governor  could identify candidate and party positions on many important issues of the day  knew the unemployment rate or the percentage of the public living in poverty or without health insurance or  had knowledge of how much of the federal budget is spent on defense foreign aid or social welfare delli carpini and keeter   and despite heavy use of the internet delli carpini noted in  these numbers had not improved delli carpini   in a  new york times op ed article titled america the clueless frank bruni points out that  of americans could not name one supreme court justice that after  years of constant attention by politicians and the  hour news cycle  were unaware that obamacare was law and that  did not know who was vice president bruni  the more i read and the more i listen former supreme court justice sandra day oconnor told an idaho audience in  the more apparent it is that our society suffers from an alarming degree of public ignorance retired justice sandra day oconnor  if americans care to be better informed the  public library facilities available to them up  from  will provide this information free still if surveys are accurate about how poorly informed most americans are one has to question whether the public librarys rhetoric as an institution essential to democracy holds up against the evidence yes some of the  million americans who visit a public library every year go there for information as lis discourse currently defines it and american public library history boasts thousands of patron success stories that prove many did but more many more are apparently usingand lovingtheir public libraries for other purposes to unearth reasons why we have to expand lis discourse beyond information because people do not have to use a public library what patrons wantand by their definition what they needgives them a power other civic institutions deny them and forces public libraries to mediate competing community desires what a public library iswhat i try to describe in part of our livesreflects these compromises since the mid nineteenth century the american public library has been an essential public sphere institution providing many kinds of informal but important learning experiences to millions of americans over time public libraries multiplied survived and regularly prospered in large part because they perpetuated practices or eventually embraced changes upon which their users insisted they have been public places of performance where users displayed moral progress and achievement they have operated as a robust commons where members of the public discussed in a variety of ways issues that concerned them they have functioned as centripetal forces to craft a sense of community local state and national among disparate populations and evolve community trust between its multicultural elements they have acted as key players in constructing group identity through the stories and places they provided and they have started neighborhood conversations welcomed the recently arrived into their midst and served as community anchors through the public spaces they provided public libraries have functioned as incubators for the kinds of social relationships that resulted in personal happiness public libraries also functioned as sites where communities displayed the social harmony they helped generate like naming a branch after an accomplished african american writer decades after the same library system denied him use of the facility and for cultural minorities of all kinds public libraries helped break the bonds of self segregation some accepted newcomers more quickly than others some used their buildings as community space more than others still the evidence presented in part of our lives shows what many accomplished and thus identifies public sphere traditions heretofore seldom recognized and therefore not much acknowledged in lis discourse or its research the public librarys mediating traditions have also been central to its existence and over the years have helped define the parameters of its communitys acceptable cultural and literary values public libraries make statements all the time in their collections services decorations and physical plant but they do it within acceptable boundaries defined by local communities when a public library appears to violate that trust community members force mediation analysis of the solutions over time also demonstrates the shifting center of a communitys value system through the stories songs films and videos they make available american public libraries provide social knowledge and models for ethical behavior that users appropriate for their everyday lives tools such as stereopticons may have disappeared but the stories they contained have remained a public librarys stock in trade albeit in newer packages newer cultural forms american public libraries also allowed users to manifest cultural tastes that personalized the formation of morals and self discipline and within a larger cultural environment contained enough room for most people to be selective in the kinds of stories and cultural forms they want not all public library users became as successful as sonia sotomayor but like her they experienced the kinds of emotions and sentiments stories provide to enhance lifes good times and help weather the bad the american public library also stands as one of the few civic institutions resistant to the centralizing tendencies that federalism has characterized in the last century although it has sought and accepted federal money and made very good use of it it has nonetheless resisted federal control because  of their funding comes from local taxation public libraries are local organisms living within the social and cultural environments their communities create for them no matter how hard alas office of intellectual freedom tries to protest what it calls censorial practices and thus influence cultural values in communities across the nation the american public library still makes decisions at the local level and at that level it acts as a platform to mediate community values to the satisfaction of most in a bloodless but often messy and sometimes public way history also shows that since the early twentieth century every generation of librarians experiencing budget pressures engaged in crisis discourse to predict disaster forand in recent years even the demise ofthe american public library yet part of our lives clearly shows that these predictions have little basis in history but that does not stop librarians from a birdsong that predicts disaster at every budget cyclea birdsong that relies on replicating the discourse and reinforcing a stereotyped history thus overlooking the primary experiences that generations of public library users identify with these civic institutions in many cases librarians lack of knowledge about their own history is evident from statements such as public libraries are not just warehouses of books anymore part of our lives shows that they never were for effect and contrast journalists often parroted and reinforced this myth by drawing on these stereotypes and their own limited public library experiences much of this shortsightedness can be traced to tunnel vision brought about by the limits of lis discourse reasons for looking past place and reading stories can be traced to two professional positions first librarians participate in the dissemination of information and misinformation but refuse to be held accountable for the latter this refusal not only helps explain a relative lack of professional power lawyers and doctors are accountable for the information they provide it also shows why librarians share power with public library users to shape public library collections and services second alas office of intellectual freedom has carefully cultivated an ethos that what people read is a privacy right that librarians need to protect this ethos encourages libraries to destroy records of public library transactions immediately after an object is returned in effect however this practice deprives researchers of valuable data that could be studied to improve services and deepen understanding of the public librarys community value conventional social science research methods that comply with state confidentiality laws librarians do not enjoy the privilege status of medicine and law easily accommodate analyses of these records all of which are public transactions for which librarians are publicly accountable perhaps within these public library transaction data setsif librarians preserved and opened them to analysisfuture scholars will discover that voluntary readingthe kind of self directed informal education that american public libraries have quietly enabled since the middle of the nineteenth centurymay do more to increase literacy of all types than the mechanics of reading forced by formal education no child left behind federal programs and common core state standards that focus on close reading nonfiction and text complexity measured by reading formulas the testimony of hundreds of public library users especially recent immigrants cited in part of our lives strongly suggests that this may be so but we need research to test this hypothesis this kind of data could also become central to social science and humanities scholars now building a new research arena often called culturomics an umbrella term describing quantitative inquiries into cultural phenomena using technology to research massive data sets jockers  humanities is an area ripe for exploiting big data argues alice meadows in a september   wiley exchanges blog meadows  two days later the united kingdoms institute of education issued a reportbelieved to be the first to examine the effect of reading for pleasure on cognitive development over timethat found children who read for pleasure made more progress in maths vocabulary and spelling between the ages of  and  than those who rarely read reading for pleasure  another recent study of american children enrolled in public library summer reading programs showed that they scored higher on reading achievement tests in the subsequent school year than those who did not participate roman carran and fiore  finally recent research also suggests that reading harry potter books can help reduce prejudice toward minority groups such as recent immigrants and gays jacobs  given the fact that circulating commonplace stories read heard and viewed by users continues to be what public libraries do most i have to wonder why inquiries like these are not central to lis research unfortunately most professional library education programs seem willfully blind to the importance of reading and place as these programs evolved over the past  years some stayed close to library others privileged a focus on information defined by the discourse they inherited and married largely to the storage and retrieval properties of developing communications technologies among the  i schools  ala accredited that met for the first time in  almost none had courses analyzing reading and place from a library in the life of the user perspective unless ala through its committee on accreditationalso steeped in a formal way of thinking manifesting a social boundaryinsists that reading and place are part of librarianships domain professional programs will likely continue to replicate the discourse and manifest the same tunnel vision i spoke of  years ago if part of our lives proves that reading and place have been as important to the american public library as information then not having a core course in either at ala accredited programs is the equivalent of an american bar associationaccredited law school without a core course on the constitution or civil procedure although in  the  librarians holding a masters degree in library and information studies made up  of  public library employees the overwhelming majority of those graduates was no better prepared by their professional education to understand the role of reading and place in public libraries than their colleagues without lis degrees part of our lives proves to my satisfaction that public libraries are much more than information based on my findings i argue that lis needs systematic longitudinal studies of the impact of reading on users and the roles of library as place to deepen understanding of the public librarys impact and effectiveness absent these studies  years from now someone is going to discover yet again that the american public library is a community center and the next j k rowling phenomenon will be rationalized as reading is essential rather than investigated for reasons why readers want these stories and what they learn from them and without research that expands the professions discourse to analyze the effects impacts and roles of the american public library as a public sphere institution that provides its community within addition to informationessential reading experiences and public spaces contemporary policy makers will continue to be greatly handicapped in efforts to plan its future if the lis community chooses to listen to the voices of users across the generations cited in part of our lives it must expand its professional discourse by elevating its focus on library as place and initiating a serious investigation of the impact of voluntary reading most of my argument so far has addressed tunnel vision in lis discourse what about blind spots evidence suggests that they still exist in the twenty first century libraries are simply institutions that tell a story said winnebago tribal member and huntington park california public librarian michael mclaughlin in a  native american times article it is the community that decides what that story is and how it is told to mclaughlin however it was clear that librarianships practices placed native americans at a distinct disadvantage in the story public libraries told about them for example neither the library of congress nor the dewey decimal classification adequately addresses the histories and contemporary realities of american indians neither had a category for tribal sovereignty that enjoyed equal status with other systems of government similarly although picasso and monet were classified art indian sand paintings pottery and basketry were classified crafts or primitive art and although protestantism and catholicism found comfortable niches in religion indian spiritualism was found in mythology folklore and other religion in short mclaughlin concluded every american indian perspective accomplishment or cultural belief practice or material product according to these classification systems is of a subordinate or inferior nature mclaughlin   although public libraries cannot be all things to all people part of our lives shows that they have been more things to more people than most cultural authoritiesincluding many librarianshave realized with an understanding of this past american public libraries might see opportunities to exploit possibilities made visible by playing outside their conventional sandbox of ideas to be even more things to more people than they have in the past its all on the internet hype evangelists of information technology libraries are dinosaurs grouse officials looking to cut budgets part of our lives demonstrates that these statements are based on a greatly limited understanding of what public libraries do and are as this article goes to press i just finished reading susan pinkers the village effect how face to face contact can make us healthier happier and smarter  by harnessing research in the fast developing field of social neuroscience pinker finds that those who experience high levels of face to face contact accrue substantial benefits including an improved vocabulary an increased ability to empathize a deeper sense of belonging andmost importanta longer life span as i pondered her conclusions i wondered whether american public library users lived longer happier and healthier lives than nonusers and if they do why answering that question requires librarianship to expand its traditional discourse in order to explore the community building benefits of public library as place and the sociability that reading fosters one final observation in my lifetime of research into american library history ive read hundreds of sweeping predictions concerning the future of these ubiquitous institutions of those grounded largely on a particular definition of useful knowledge in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries on best books in the nineteenth and twentieth and on information in the twentieth and twenty first none proved true that did not also give equal consideration to library as place and the power of reading if history is a teacher we all have to keep that in mind as we ponder todays predictions about and plans for tomorrows public
