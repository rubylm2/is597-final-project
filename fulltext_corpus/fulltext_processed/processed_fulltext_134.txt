for all the people public library directors interpret intellectual freedom shannon m oltmann abstract intellectual freedom is frequently seen as a core value of librarianship especially by the american library association which has issued extensive guidance to libraries about implementing intellectual freedom some scholars criticize these documents arguing that they are unrealistic and do not offer meaningful support to libraries while scholars question the value of ala policies it is unclear whether practicing librarians have similar concerns about the library bill of rights lbr and related guidelines this article describes a study of public libraries and their interpretation of the lbr in their daily practice to investigate the role played by ala documents  public library directors across one state were interviewed in general the library directors did not directly cite or quote from ala documents yet their stances echoed ala guidance in addition library directors frequently discussed the significance of community in their interpretations and implementations of intellectual freedom intellectual freedom if is a core value of librarianship according to the american libraryassociation ala it has been defined as the right of every individual to both seek andreceive information from all points of view without restriction ala g par  intellectual freedom is tightly entwined with access to information particularly in public libraries see eg oltmann  many scholars and practitioners reiterate the foundational core nature of if eg gorman  harkovitch hirst and loomis  knox  morrissey  for example don fallis  explains that library professionals mission is essentially to provide members of society with access to the information that they need  catherine foster and david mcmenemy  note that access to information is a universal value of librarians globally with intellectual freedom also frequently recognized however the power and relevance of if for public librarians remains understudied other than work by michael harkovitch and colleagues  few studies have directly asked librarians about their perspective on or use of ala guidance and the harkovitch et al study focused primarily on internet filtering see moody  and taylor and mcmenemy  for library quarterly information community policy vol  no  pp    by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
public library directors interpret intellectual freedom   international studies a few studies have noted the absence of such work eliza dresang  explains that it is difficult for an academic researcher to write confidently about the state of intellectual freedom in relation to libraries because very little scholarly data based research exists that would inform a comprehensive analysis about the contemporary situation  in addition to the philosophical legal descriptive and theoretical accounts that dresang mentions emily knox  notes that perhaps the most common type of research on intellectual freedom and censorship is written by practitioners and consists primarily of case studies and reflective essays  see also harkovitch et al   most of these works describe recent occurrences at a local library depicted as a case study or a practicing librarians reflection on the importance of if few provide analytical depth the research described here begins to close this gap with a qualitative study of public library directors across the state of kentucky this research uncovers the meaning interpretation and application of if in public libraries in one southern state in general most directors expressed views similar to the guidance that has been issued by ala and the kentucky department for libraries and archives kdla however they also articulated complex multidimensional perspectives on community and its relation to if which are not reflected in current official guidance literature review intellectual freedom as knox  notes in contemporary librarianship the principle upholding intellectual freedom and opposing censorship is codified within the profession  the principle of if for patrons is elaborated upon and strengthened in the library bill of rights lbr and the accompanying official interpretations as well as in the code of ethics and other related statements wiegand  cohen and minow  dresang  the first principle of the lbr states that books and other library resources should be provided for the interest information and enlightenment of all people of the community the library serves materials should not be excluded because of the origin background or views of those contributing to their creation ala i principle i the subsequent five principles also address if and various related topics libraries are encouraged to have information presenting all points of view on current and historical issues to challenge censorship and to resist abridgment of free expression and free access to ideas ala i principles iiiv the fifth principle states that a persons right to use a library should not be denied or abridged because of origin age background or views this is often seen as the most controversial principle because of the inclusion of age see eg fricke mathiesen and fallis  finally the sixth principle of the lbr addresses exhibit spaces and meeting rooms in the context of if stating that these spaces must be available on an equitable basis regardless
  the library quarterly of the beliefs or affiliations of individuals or groups requesting their use the ala then offers  interpretations of the lbr found in the intellectual freedom manual and on the ala website designed to answer questions that arise concerning application of these principles to specific library practices ala h par  likewise most state level library associations provide support and guidance for libraries in their state for example the kentucky department of libraries and archives offers continuing education classes and sample policy statements to assist kentucky public libraries one aspect of if that has received a great deal of scrutiny is the use of internet filters in libraries particularly public libraries mccabe  jaeger bertot and mcclure  the use of internet filters tied by law to federal e rates and library services and technology act funds has been contentious in the library community it is unknown how many public libraries use internet filters or how their use affects if for patrons the ala has taken the stance that filters should not be used whenever possible if they must be used because of federal funding then they should be set at the least restrictive settings from the official ala perspective if is a clear and simple principle that all librarians should embrace defend individuals right to freely access information and resist efforts to censor or restrict access see baldwin  for a critique of this absolutist stance for example ala regards challenges to materials as a threat to freedom of speech and choice ala b whenever library materials are challenged ala recommends a formal hearing to address the concerns ala e the organization is strongly opposed to relocating or removing items due to patron concerns it is not known to what extent this stance is echoed in public libraries some scholars question whether the principle of if is such a simple matter to implement in public libraries harkovitch et al  report that many librarians in their study questioned alas approach to intellectual freedom and internet filtering  for example martin fricke kay mathiesen and don fallis  and fiona duthie  argue that there are conceivable sensible reasons for occasional censorship but the lbr and related documents do not allow for such exceptions gordon baldwin  offers a detailed critique of the lbr summarized as it promises more than it can deliver  shirley a wiegand  explains that the lbr is a mixture of rhetoric rights and reality which may be at times unhelpful and at other times downright misleading  others note that if principles are vague and their application to actual concrete cases is somewhat unclear fallis  the ala guidance on if and its interpretations do not have the force of law and are not mandatory policies that libraries must follow nonetheless this guidance is highly prescriptive and libraries are generally encouraged to follow it for example the preamble to the lbr states that all libraries are forums for information and ideas and that the following basic policies should guide their services ala i par  thus ala makes it clear that libraries ought to follow these policies though there are no penalties for not doing so
public library directors interpret intellectual freedom   community in the discussions of if within the ala literature little mention is made of community the assumption is that the if principles are universal and can be applied consistently across all communities yet the omission of community is particularly conspicuous when discussing public librariessimply because public libraries exist to serve their communities there is an extensive literature for example that describes community building and engagement efforts of public libraries eg willingham  edwards rauseo and unger  scott a b sung hepworth and ragsdell  sung and hepworth  as rachel scott b notes these community efforts involve being proactive and thinking about what libraries can do to build strong communities and meet the needs of the people  in the community the literature describes several ways that libraries serve their communities offering childrens services creating programming assisting job seekers providing educational opportunities and so on several authors mention public libraries role in providing a broad range of information carr  edwards et al  scott a b typical of the literature is scott a who writes the public library is a democratic equalizer open to all and providing access to information that helps people improve their individual family and community lives  none of these authors explicitly connects if with providing broad access to a wide range of information perhaps they believe the concept of if is embedded within this access model what is a community within the library literature community is rarely defined it is often a taken for granted assumption about the people served by a library usually communities are understood to be geographically bound groups of people within a particular service area see eg jaeger et al  scott a b anthony  in the broader literature there has been extensive research and reflection on the meaning of community which is too vast to be reviewed here however a review of its use in sociology demonstrated that community was most often understood as a group of persons a engaging in social interaction b within a geographic area and c having a common tie or ties goe and noonan   this perspective aligns with the stance taken by much of the library literature and is the one adopted in this article method the data for this project were collected via qualitative face to face interviews this is an effective method for probing beneath the surface soliciting detail and providing a holistic understanding of the interviewees point of view patton   darren lilleker  explained that interviews can provide immense amounts of information that could not be gleaned from official published documents or contemporary media accounts  data from the kentucky department of libraries and archives were used to determine the  largest public libraries in the state based on size of collection these  public library systems are located in the largest urban and suburban areas and in large towns in every region
  the library quarterly of the state the largest libraries were chosen for two reasons first it is more likely that the largest libraries have directors with mls degrees and exposure to the lbr and to the principles of if second because these libraries have the largest collections and correspondingly large patron bases they may be more likely to have experience dealing with if in their libraries once the  largest public library systems were identified the director of each system was sent a recruitment letter via e mail with an offer to participate in this study fifteen directors consented to be interviewed directors were of various races ages and genders tenure in their current position ranged from less than  year to more than  years two directors met with the researcher together but all other interviews were conducted one on one the interviews lasted an average of  minutes ranging from  to  minutes and took place between november  and march  table  lists the pseudonyms of the interviewees and the length of their interviews because this research seeks in part to understand the role played by official guidelines it is useful to review them in conjunction with the participants comments the interviews were conducted face to face in the directors offices and were recorded with the participants permission the interviews were later transcribed and analyzed with nvivo  to protect confidentiality each participant was given a randomly selected name that has no table  pseudonyms of interviewees and length of interviews length of interview interviewee in minutes and seconds aidan  arnold a beth a carson  janelle  jonas  julianna  justin b lilly  luke  miles  patti  roslyn  stanley  tonya  a arnold and beth were interviewed together b justins interview was cut short due to a small crisis in his library
public library directors interpret intellectual freedom   correlation with gender identifying details in their responses are obfuscated selected results are presented below results this section summarizes and explains the data from the project the interviews yielded a wide range of general information about conceptualizations of if and challenges to library materials as well as more specific focused examinations of if related issues defining if central to this discussion of if is the definition of this phrase as noted earlier ala defines intellectual freedom to include the right to seek and receive information and to access all expressions of ideas ala g par  intellectual freedom is listed as a core value of librarianship and is one of the ethical principles that guide the work of librarians ala d par  the kdla the statewide organization for kentucky libraries does not offer its own definition of if though it has endorsed the lbr the freedom to read statement and the freedom to view statement the principle of if is mentioned in kdla collection development sample policies and in guidance offered for library trustees all participants in this study offered some definition of if during the interview even lilly who had been a library director for less than  year and did not have a library background noted i wouldnt say i that i know the nuances or full application but ive heard of it if as both a phrase and an idea was very familiar to the participants in general the library directors had three different perspectives on intellectual freedom an impersonal formal view a personalized perspective and a community oriented approach the formal approach echoed the ideas and concepts of ala closely hewing to the official stance of the organization the personalized perspective tended to involve some personal reflection about or application of the principles of if individuals spoke about what if meant to them finally the communityoriented approach focused on the broader public being served here we can see the directors emphasis on the communities their libraries serve for the formal approach consider jonas who defined intellectual freedom as people can have access to whatever they want and make up their own minds period the end of it miles stated that it is the right for every individual to seek information without fear of judgment or repercussion or restriction carson added i guess for me it means being able to access any materials that you want or need to in order to pursue your interests and studies or whatever it might be the bottom line is people are able to think freely and explore luke noted that if includes the freedom for people to read as well as the freedom for people to watch what they want to watch these quotes reveal an orientation toward a generalized conception of if and they are quite similar to alas construction the right of every individual to both seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction
  the library quarterly in contrast several participants explained if in a personal manner such as janelle who said i want to read things i want to view things and i should be allowed to do that the library should support that as much as it can stanley echoed this view stating for me personally intellectual freedom is about being able to explore any area that i want to as far as researching or understanding anything    without being judged for it roslyn explained that people should be able to read whatever they want to read for whatever reason and no one should be told their choices are inappropriate she felt this way because i dont want someone telling me what to read or not to read emphasis in original participants also described if with a community orientation in terms of serving the broader public janelle described intellectual freedom personally but also as a community service explaining that there are a wide variety of people in this county and that they have a wide variety of interests and we as a popular materials library are going to attempt to meet the biggest majority of those interests aidan noted we are here for everybody and if you want to have a balanced collection you have to be serving everyone in the community julianna expanded upon this asserting that the library is not here to govern what you read but to provide you opportunities for all kinds of things and you never know who wants what or why they want something i think that is one of the things that libraries do really well and if we dont do it then we are doing a disservice to our community because there are so few places out there that are open only one participant had a notably contrarian view of if justin said i wouldnt spend any time trying to define it because he had other more pressing concerns in directing the daily activities of the library except for justin participants were unanimous in endorsing if as a general principle applicable in their libraries miles argued that if is what were all about and thats as far as i can tell why libraries were created and why they still exist challenges to library material the library directors were asked how often their library materials were challenged by members of the community in this discussion challenge meant a formal written request for reconsideration the ala declares as a matter of firm principle that it is the responsibility of every library to have a clearly defined materials selection policy in written form that reflects the library bill of rights ala c par  this interpretation also states that challenged materials that meet the criteria for selection    should not be removed under any legal or extra legal pressure par  coupled with the relevant code of ethics statement we uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and resist all efforts to censor library resources this is a strong stance against removing materials from libraries ala d implicit in the alas guidance is an equivalence drawn between censors and challengers those who question the inclusion of certain materials in the library
public library directors interpret intellectual freedom   nearly all participants replied that they received few challenges though as table  indicates the number of challenges varies widely aidan indicated his library received a few challenges per month which would equal two or three dozen over the course of a year other directors reporting a high number of challenges include janelle  per year and tonya  per year however three participants reported zero challenges patti roslyn and stanley and two noted only one challenge julianna and miles it is interesting that despite this variation the library directors generally felt the number of challenges they experienced personally was low in other words they did not find challenges to be taxing or overwhelming twelve of the  participants explicitly noted they had a policy for challenges to library material typically called a request for reconsideration as justin tonya and stanley noted most libraries have very similar cookie cutter policies based upon recommendations from ala and the kdla under the heading material selectioncomplaints for example the kdla offers three sample policies that libraries can adopt the policies suggest that patrons should fill out a request for reconsideration of library materials form the director should then review the item both in terms of the librarys materials selection statement and the opinion of the various reviewing sources used in materials selection after the director decides whether to keep the item the patron may appeal to the library board of trustees a similar process is outlined in alas policy guidance dealing with concerns about library table  frequency of formal challenges to library materials as estimated by library directors participant how frequently library material was challenged aidan a few times every month arnold na beth na carson na janelle  times per year jonas  times per year julianna  time per year justin  times per year lilly na luke  times per year miles  time in past  or more years patti  times in past year roslyn  times in past  or more years stanley  times in past  or more years tonya  times per year notena indicates that the participant did not answer this question because the interview veered in a different direction
  the library quarterly resources e most directors interviewed indicated that this process is more or less followed in their own libraries several noted that they convened an ad hoc committee of library staff to respond to patron concerns before the complaint escalated to the director thus adding an additional step in the process aidan arnold carson janelle jonas lilly luke roslyn and tonya described in the directors own words this process is designed to demonstrate concern for patrons and create a rational reasonable and repeatable method of responding carson aptly explained this orientation by noting we wanted to honor the fact that they had this concern and take it seriously and let them know that we were listening to what they were saying    and that we have a system in place so its not just dismissive of their concerns the ala similarly notes that librarians should respond in a respectful and fair manner ala e par  when a patron expressed concern or unhappiness about an item most libraries according to the directors began by listening to the concern and offering the patron the request for reconsideration form janelle noted that if somebody challenges an item the training for the staff is smile and hand them the form    were purposely trying to be nonconfrontational roslyn estimated that  of her patrons did not take the form and of those who did take the form few returned it echoing this patti said most of the time the patrons just want to tell you they dont want to get into a bunch of written stuff but they just want you to know how they feel about it the next step in the process is that the director andor a committee of library staff watched or read the material then aidan explained we look at the reviews of the material to see if its generally accepted in the community and in the literature we look at how many times its checked out to determine whether an item is worth keeping in the collection other participants indicated they had a similar process finally one of three outcomes occurred the item was removed the item was relocated or the item was kept in its original location the directors reported that library materials were rarely removed completely from circulation only one director luke said he had pulled something weve pulled one item out of all the ones that have been challenged and the only reason why it was pulled is because it was so damaged that you couldnt even watch it six directors  indicated that they had relocated items usually moving something from the childrens section to the young adult section or from the teen section to the adult section carson janelle jonas julianna miles and stanley julianna explained we moved it to a more appropriate collection it was in the kids collection and it really needed to be in the juvenile collection so we moved it weve done that a couple of times thats usually where it belongs its been miscategorized and put in the wrong collection jonas and stanley similarly noted that their library staff decided to move some items that were inappropriately cataloged after they were alerted by patrons janelle noted that most of the time it is not
public library directors interpret intellectual freedom   that somebody is wanting us to pull the material but that they are wanting us to change the designation to move it up to a higher reading level however the participants indicated that the most common response to patron requests for reconsideration was to keep the item in its original location while explaining the decision to the patron for example beth said i normally just explain that the library is there for everybody in his responses justin emphasized the broad and diverse readership that the library serves by noting there is a readership for this material and if you prefer not to read it or have your child read it you are in a position to control that but you are not in a position to control someone elses ability to read it tonya responded to patrons by referring back to the mission of the public library explaining that because we are an organization dedicated to freedom of reading and materials and information we feel like the challenged material needs to stay in the collection finally roslyn noted the importance of expressing understanding i try to let them know that i see both sides im a parent and i want to protect my child but then again im also a librarian who believes everyone should be able to read what they want to read these explanations illustrate the participants beliefs in respecting patrons concerns and replying in a thoughtful courteous manner for example miles reported that his library responded to a parents concern as follows we appreciated her interest in the library and her interest in her own child    and we appreciated that she was being careful and being aware of what her child was reading this echoes alas stance on childrens access to library resources ala acknowledges and supports the exercise by parents of their responsibility to guide their own children reading and viewing ala a par  in addition participants stressed the importance of a balanced diverse collection when replying to patrons lukes comment provides an example of how this was done our staffs pretty good about explaining to people okay you find this particular book to be offensive perhaps there are other books that you would find perfectly acceptable that other people in the community would find offensive and if we start pulling everything off the shelf that everybody finds offensive theres nothing on the shelf our role as a public library is to provide information to the entire community and not just to one portion of the community and most of the time that works tonya echoed this approach saying that her favorite explanation to someone who is very conservative in their beliefs is to clarify that the same law that guarantees the freedom of information for the material that you are concerned about also gives us the freedom of being able to purchase christian fiction and nonfiction once she explains this to patrons they realize that its across the board the openness again this is similar to the official stance of ala which argues that librarians have a professional responsibility to be inclusive in collection development and this includes content that reflect a diversity of issues whether they be for example political economic religious social ethnic or sexual ala f par 
  the library quarterly participants were asked about content that was frequently challenged or questioned even if not via a formal written challenge and their answers are summarized in table  most of the library directors thought the primary issue that concerned patrons was sex or sexuality luke said there was one person that was just horrified about a homosexual orientation of a movie and it was the most violent movie ive ever seen in my life there were no problems with the violence though its just how people look at the issue stanley noted that all of our counties are very different from each other but the one thing that everybody loses their shirt over is if somebodys gay ie a character in a library book or movie thats the only time ive had a complaint lilly described an incident in which a library patron requested the library begin purchasing a gaylesbian magazine after talking with staff lilly realized the library could not afford to add another magazine at the time so she explained that to the patron but added the library would begin purchasing the magazine once it was financially possible lilly concluded i probably didnt have enough time to think about all the ramifications of that but at the moment that seemed like the right thing to do now i think it will be a controversial matter to have that magazine here another frequent topic of concern was graphic novels as janelle noted young adult literature often deals with controversial or sensitive topics and when that is portrayed graphically people have a problem with that its also a problem because of superhero things and when you get superhero things you get women in very skin tight suits and that can cause problems luke julianna miles and roslyn all noted that they had moved some graphic novels to the adult section for similar reasons  shades of grey was discussed because it was a controversial yet popular book at the time the interviews were conducted all  participants said their library had multiple copies of the book and that the book had extensive holds from people wanting to read the book beth noted we have it in print audio and e book on at least two platforms the directors explained that this book was a good example of serving the community because even though the book did not receive strong reviews it was in high demand so libraries carried it while julianna was absolutely astounded and patti was shocked that they had not received complaints about the book others noted that the high demand for the book and the series indicated a certain level of community acceptance roslyn reported that a lady did bring one copy of  shades of grey back and said i cannot believe that you all have this but of course she had requested to read it and you cant tell me she didnt know what it was but we just said well its not for everybody internet filtering twelve of the  participants reported that their library used internet filtering to reduce access to pornography and other internet content most directors indicated their library chose to use
public library directors interpret intellectual freedom   table  content types that are frequently challenged according to library directors participant content that is frequently challenged or cause for patron concern aidan a few challenges based on language    but most of the ones ive seen are because of sexual orientation carson as far as the subject matter goes it was probably more coming of age sorts of issues you know sexuality janelle a particular problem with videos that are not rated    sometimes childrens books are challenged particularly graphic novels julianna its usually a very small point or its foul language    its usually content too advanced for an age language or some incident in the book luke it tends to be issues of sex and issues of politics theyre our two issues    it usually has to do with homosexuality or sexual issues miles it would be the theme and sometimes the fantasy theme    and then language patti rated r movies    sex usually roslyn it was a graphic novel    another one had to do with the slang language from the mark twain era    i think the most common concern is sex stanley if somebodys gay tonya its a youth something    we had some challenges to r rated dvds because there was graphic sex    sex thats a good general term gay or just graphic filtering as a result of the childrens internet protection act which tied certain federal funds to the use of internet filters arnold said we needed the money weve sold our soul but he then elaborated noting that adult patrons can request the filters be turned off and that filters have become more sophisticated and less prone to error carson agreed that the filters have improved janelle said we have not really had too many problems with the filter a lot of people take it off if they have an adult library card she explained that her library used internet filters because we dont have playboy on the shelf even though that might be a popular interest we dont see it as something that we are going to collect and so we dont allow our computers to be used that way either jonas and several other participants noted that patrons can ask for the filter to be lifted or overridden and that library staff are very willing to do so justins comments about internet filtering stand out he said patrons can request all they want but thats not our policy the internet use policy at justins library does not allow for adults to access the unfiltered internet in direct contravention to ala recommendations as anne klinefelter  noted eight of the justices on the supreme court found the ability of adult patrons to gain access to protected internet speech to be important to the constitutionality of the librarys use of internet software filters p  in other words the ability to turn off the filter upon request was a significant factor in the childrens internet protection act being upheld by the supreme court the ala has taken a firm stance opposing internet filtering though many librarians are supportive of it luke noted that the initial concept through the library system was that we
  the library quarterly werent going to use filtering after a week the librarians changed their minds    it was becoming a community issue and a nightmare to try to police it similarly roslyn commented that in our community i think there are more people who would be upset if we didnt filter stanley discussed the pain caused to the library and the entire community by a child pornography case it was such a devastating incident not only for us but it was horrendous for the community    we tried our very best not to filter the computers having an acceptable use policy putting the computers in a very open place and it was just incredible that this individual managed to literally go around everything that we had and its not happening again here its not the same we talked about this before we added the filters and all of us feel very strong about our intellectual freedom stance here we were one of the few public libraries our size that operated with no filters whatsoever    but its very very different to access hardcore porn on a computer where anybody walking behind you can see it never again emphasis in original others however were more skeptical of internet filtering and said their libraries did not use filters aidan explained we dont want to interfere with the intellectual freedom of everyone just to solve a problem thats very localized and specific and doesnt happen all that often the problem to which he referred was patron viewing of pornography or other inappropriate content beth noted that for very introverted or shy patrons having to ask a librarian to remove the filter might be too much of a barrier to overcome and thus those patrons would be left using a filtered internet for that reason beth was opposed to the use of filters in addition she viewed them as a violation of peoples right to access information justin noted that internet filtering is thorny for librarians and not very thorny for anybody else he meant that most community members as other participants noted would likely be in favor of internet filtering because it reduces the occurrence of pornography and other inappropriate content librarians perhaps guided by alas arguments appear more conflicted about internet filtering meeting rooms all libraries studied here had meeting rooms most of which were open to the general public one director reported that her library had so little space and such large programming commitments that the meeting room was in constant use and thus was unavailable for the general publics use in general most participants indicated that they had remarkably similar policies about meeting rooms available to the general public and for nearly any use including educational political and religious purposes caveats included that the meetings had to be free and open to the general public and they could not be used as locations for political rallies or fund raising this is in line with alas guidelines which state if meeting rooms    are
public library directors interpret intellectual freedom   made available to the general public for non library sponsored events the library may not exclude any group based on the subject matter to be discussed or based on the ideas that the group advocates ala j par  the sample policies provided by the kdla use similar language to ensure that no groups are discriminated against arnold explained the basic line of thought we are a public facility and the public has an inherent right to use our meeting space we could write a policy that said nobody outside the library can use it i dont think thats a good use of space you have space going unused then but this policy does open us up if a kkk group came in and wanted to use the facility they certainly could and i made it clear to the library board of trustees that i would support their ability to do that a few directors noted that the tea party political group used library facilities this was ironic because as janelle said they are not friendly to the library because were a taxing entity    but they meet here regularly and i have no problem with that individuals affiliated with the tea party have been vocal in their opposition to the way that kentucky libraries are funded through occasional tax increases see warburton  nonetheless library directors unanimously supported the groups right to use library meeting facilities luke described receiving phone calls from a liberal political group unhappy with the tea partys use of library facilities once he explained i cant deny them use of the meeting room and allow you to have use of the meeting room he said they got it they still werent happy about it though jonas summarized the general consensus its inappropriate for us to tell someone what they can or cant say we dont have to agree with whatever their message is    but if  theyre not breaking any of our rules or regulations we dont have the right to deny someone that freedom to meet privacy and confidentiality in general the library directors indicated that they took patron privacy seriously and had strict policies in place to limit the sharing or exposure of patron information most libraries shared two basic components of privacy policies first patron records are treated as confidential and not released to law enforcement without court orders subpoenas or similar documentation as carson said its pretty standard stuff we wont release patron records at all without a warrant or something along those lines second many participants said they made efforts to keep as few patron records as possible beth noted that she had purchased a module for the circulation system that immediately scrubs patron transactions so there are no records luke explained our internet services are set up that after midnight the search history is gone anyway i cannot go back and tell you what a patron looked at even if i wanted to these two tenets are in line with recommendations from ala which advocates for patron privacy stating in protecting the privacy rights and the confidentiality rights of library users librarians staff educators volunteers and trustees should limit the degree to which per
  the library quarterly sonally identifiable information is monitored collected disclosed and distributed ala l par  the ala also recommends that libraries make patron records available to law enforcement only with proper court orders or other documentation in addition ala states in all areas of librarianship best practice leaves the user in control of as many choices as possible these include decisions about the selection of access to and use of information lack of privacy and confidentiality has a chilling effect on users choices all users have a right to be free from any unreasonable intrusion into or surveillance of their lawful library use ala k par  the kdla does not have specific recommendations about patron privacy but it does have suggested policies about records management and retention it recommends that libraries keep records for the minimum amount of time required by state statue and protect records that have been protected by state statute according to the library directors they have created several processes by which patrons maintain at least some control over their own accounts several participants explained that patrons could choose to turn on tracking of their library accounts to keep a record of which books they have checked out patrons may choose this to remember which books they have read other libraries allow patrons to use a third party system to track their books miles noted that the parent has some rights in that area so his library allows parental access to child circulation records but tonya had a different view on this we wont tell the parents what the kids have out for obvious reasons when asked to elaborate she raised a hypothetical situation and said if a child comes in and checks out books about child abuse were not going to tell the parents other participants reported additional hypothetical situations or real life occurrences that affected how they viewed privacy in their libraries beth told her staff what if its a situation in which a wife and husband are having some problems and shes checked out a book on a doit yourself divorce julianna noted weve had a couple of instances where divorcing parents have battled over kids accounts and then the staff starts seeing firsthand why you shouldnt give that information out stanley told the story of a former drug user who turned his life around and then came to the library when faced with temptation because i knew you guys could help me stanley emphasized that we want the library to be a place where people can come in and say i dont have anyplace else to go i know you guys arent going to tell my story to anyone luke recounted that two women have come to the circulation desk and said that they are abused by their husbands and they were checking out materials about how to leave an abusive spouse they were asking the question would we release that information on her record to her husband and we said absolutely not its totally against our policies in addition to these specific instances that illustrate the importance of patron privacy the library directors also had more philosophical general reasons for protecting patrons information julianna explained that protecting the privacy and the right for someone to come in
public library directors interpret intellectual freedom   and get what they need i think its extremely important becausehow do you say that without sounding strangewhat anybody else reads or why they read something can be misconstrued so easily miles added a big part in my head of intellectual freedom is that anyone can check out whatever they feel is appropriate and were not going to share that information with anyone finally some participants noted that patrons were not always in agreement with the libraries conceptualization of privacy often spouses wanted to use one anothers cards or have access to holds or circulation information parents wanted access to childrens accounts as well arnold said our patrons will complain that we will not let anybody use another persons card janelle described a situation shortly after the  tragedy in which a patron checked out a book about flying aircraft and jokingly said she might end up on an fbi list because of her circulation record when janelle assured the patron there was no list and the fbi would not be visiting her she went completely  degrees on me and decided that there should be a list and the fbi should be checking on who was checking out this book emphasis in original library staff and if many participants  out of  explicitly recognized their staff in relation to if both negatively and positively for example julianna noted that sometimes one of the things weve had to watch for    is staff not wanting to buy something because of what might happen this can be seen as a form of censorship eg whelan  deciding not to purchase materials for the library because of potential patron concern limits what is available to all patrons similarly patti discussed a staff member who hesitated to purchase materials that were contrary to her personal views but patti pointed out that the books had good reviews and met all the other criteria for inclusion so they had to be included stanley had a staff person who kept hiding a certain childrens book because she didnt believe in its message he insisted the book be placed back on the shelves saying if you editorialize in a way that prevents somebody who needs that information from getting that information    if you refuse to order something just because you dont like it you cant work here however most of the comments were quite positive of the staff the library directors called their staff members extraordinary very well trained really great and quite strong and experienced as aidan said im lucky to have a staff that really understands what a public library is all about and they fully embrace that in this context he was implying that public libraries are about access to information and if miles explained that he has a conscientious staff who have a broad range of interests and ideas i think theyre in good sync with the community both adults and children participants noted the customer service aspect of working on the front lines and helping patrons particularly patrons who
  the library quarterly had concerns about library material staff often received explicit training about how to respond to these concernsgenerally by handing them a request for reconsideration form and referring the concerned patron to the director or another senior administrator generally the library directors expressed confidence in their staff and saw their staff as important tools to ensuring if in the library discussion the role of ala documents and of community overall most participants provided answers remarkably in line with ala and kdla guidance the official policies and statements of these organizations were not cited by the participants and were not quoted verbatim yet the general interpretations by public library directors echoed the formal interpretations offered by ala this congruence may not be surprising because all but one participant had an mls or equivalent degree and had exposure to ala statements about if in library school in continuing education and in providing training for library trustees even if most library directors could not quote or cite a relevant passage from an ala document the general thrust and tenor of these ala documents is well known and prevalent if one reads the literature about if however eg baldwin  wiegand  harkovitch et al  this congruence might be surprising several scholars have been skeptical that ala policies provided much guidance in day to day situations that librarians are likely to face however the participants in this study seemed satisfied with the common interpretations of if and were able to apply them with few problems in their libraries rather than being ineffective vague statements ala and kdla guidance was implicitly recognized as the foundation upon which these libraries functioned divergence from ala and kdla policies was relatively rare for example see justins comment above about not removing internet filters upon patron request however the directors did have a focus that is conspicuously absent from ala policies about if all  participants mentioned their community usually more than once as they discussed if it was clear that consideration of their communities was a central concern of these public library directors community was always a part of how participants answered questions about if in their libraries as they spoke two perspectives on community emerged community standards the library directors indicated that they thought frequently about community standards in relation to their collections edwards et al  jonas noted that his library is a community resource while miles discussed being in good sync with the community both adults and children carson expanded upon this notion you always want to cater to all interests and not censor and so forth but you also have the other piece where youre trying to reflect
public library directors interpret intellectual freedom   community standards if this thing is so far across the line that really its probably not appropriate for the collection    as long as its not somehow compromising the public good or counter to community standards because since were taxpayer supported thats something you have to consider thats where the community standard piece comes in participants felt an obligation as carson indicated to be responsive to their communities luke and stanley noted that their libraries existed because the communities wanted themwithout community support the libraries continued existence might be in jeopardy this is perhaps particularly true in kentucky with ongoing lawsuits about the taxing status of public libraries warburton  patti explained that we often have to develop our collection based on our population what we think our population can bear and enjoy aiden added you can build your collection to reflect the needs of the community roslyn when discussing internet filtering reasoned that one reason her library used filters was because of the community in our community i think there are more people who would be upset if we didnt filter the internet however the phrase community standards cannot be simply understood as a tendency to gather safe noncontroversial materials several participants mentioned that their community standards included an appreciation for intellectual freedom stanley said he had never had a formal complaint which he thought spoke well of his community he said people are by and large not going to lose their mind if they see something theyll come in and talk to me first janelle commented if you let them know that nobody gets to be the morality police for them but they also dont get to be the morality police for anybody else then they start thinking about it from a different direction    so people are pretty tolerant around here arnold noted that his community was very articulate in their beliefs that the library is for all people and access to ideas in all shapes and forms and expressions luke added people seem to understand that people have the right to read what they like to read or want to read thus for these participants community standards was a nuanced complex conception on one hand they had to be responsive to community standards and not spend limited resources on something that would be unlikely to circulate or likely to cause offense on the other hand community standards also included a certain measure of tolerance and respect for differing perspectives again this perspective is missing from much of the literature about intellectual freedom and community standards often community standards is perceived as a code for a bland nonchallenging safe collection however community standards should also be taken to mean appreciating ones community for its tolerance of diverse ideas ones community deserves respect according to the library directors because the community can often appreciate that the public library serves diverse patrons with diverse backgrounds and needs this view of community standards is closely related to the second perspective that the participants had of their communities they saw if as a way to serve their communities
  the library quarterly intellectual freedom as a responsibility to communities participants explained that if allowed them to serve their diverse communities by providing a justification and an explanation for a diverse collection for example luke said we are very big on having a balanced collection and making sure the collection meets the needs of our community he explained that balance in this context included everything from political issues to religious issues to issues of the day to making sure that the minorities in our community are being taken into consideration patti likewise noted that her librarys strategic plan talks about providing information for everyone in the community regardless of race age political or religious beliefs and that sort of thing in these interviews the library directors were very conscious of their diverse communities even if not raciallyethnically diverse they were diverse in their readership as stanley phrased it patti described an interaction with one patron who was questioning the inclusion of certain books in the library after patti explained intellectual freedom to the patron the patron replied i never thought of that i just saw a library as a library patti then answered this is the library for the people for all the people emphasis in original participants were equally conscious of the public librarys vocation to serve all possible patrons to have resources for as many people as they possibly could for these directors adhering to principles of if helped justify diverse resources and a balanced collection as described earlier several participants defined if in relation to their community janelle said the general sense of it is that there are a wide variety of people in this county and they have a wide variety of interests and we as a popular materials library are going to attempt to meet the biggest majority of those interests as we can we wont meet them all    we might have some interests that are not your interests but that doesnt mean they arent valid so well collect whatever we deem appropriate and youre free to read it or not read it as this quote illustrates the participants believed that if was in fact a responsibility owed to the community by the public library practicing intellectual freedom enabled these librarians to serve their communities more completely aidan added if our collection is not causing some controversy in the community then we dont have a good collection    because there is such a broad spectrum of people that live in the community that youre going to offend people its not our intention but if were providing a well balanced collection we are going to be making people uncomfortable sometimes this stance goes far beyond most discussions of if in the existing literature although many authors note that providing a broad range of access is an important way that libraries serve their communities there is no explicit mention of if in connection with this the participants in contrast saw if as an integral part of their service to communities a similar approach guides these directors approaches to meeting rooms providing meeting rooms with an open policy about who can use the rooms encourages community inter
public library directors interpret intellectual freedom   action and involvement and creates opportunities for diverse groups jonas noted that his librarys meeting rooms were open to any community member to host a meeting on nearly any topic but that doesnt mean we agree with whatever the subject matter is nor do we monitor what the subject matter is recall that several libraries allowed activists opposed to library taxation to use library meeting facilitiesthe library directors believed so strongly in community use that they opened the doors to groups hostile to the library itself conclusion this research examines intellectual freedom through interviews with  library directors across the state of kentucky participants were generally in agreement with alas guidelines on intellectual freedom this may demonstrate that ala positions are well represented in library science schools because  out of  participants had an mls degree or in continuing education as required by the state it seems that the stance taken by ala has been taken up by library directors at least in this state for example the participants strongly believed that they should have a diverse broad collection to appeal to a wide range of people and they were willing to defend this approach although few explicitly cited ala documents the wording and sentiments were quite similar however the library directors emphasis on community in relation to if was unexpected they indicated that if was tightly coupled with community in various ways to them the concept of community standards included an openness to diverse resources rather than being a code phrase signaling a bland uncontroversial collection the participants made an even stronger connection between if and community when they explicitly linked the two stating that preserving and promoting if was an integral part of serving their communities this is an underexplored aspect of if that deserves attention further research is needed to better understand how library directors conceptualize community service to their communities intellectual freedom and the relationships between these concepts the ala argues that if is a universal concept that can be applied across contexts and communities however the library directors interviewed here suggested this is not an accurate depiction of if in action in the daily actions and decisions of public librarians to better capture the way if is understood in public libraries ala should acknowledge its foundation in local communities currently conceptualizations of community are missing from if at the national policy level but they are present at the local enacted level public library directors currently have a balancing act to perform weighing the expectations of a national organization ala with the needs and expectations of their communities more explicit acknowledgement of this tension and suggestions for how to address community concerns would enable ala to better serve its constituents
