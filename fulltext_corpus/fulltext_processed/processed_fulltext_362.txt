the college library building charles m adams r e college library building in  relation to the function of the library in the modern college is certainly a title plain enough to call for no questioning as to meaning a good craftsman can do creditable work without the latest tools but he can do best work with good tools a college librarian can do creditable work without a building of the latest style and plan but he can do best work with a building well planned and skilfully designed for meeting the special needs of his college so much it seems to me is the sum and substance of such a paper as this we can to be sure look at the philosophy and trends of college library architecture and the relation of the librarian to the architect at new building materials and equipment at varying ideas of arrangements at changing needs of members of the faculty and students and at operations and services of the library as they affect the building we can do all that with profit the battle cry of the renaissance however should be repeated again and again ars una species mille the principle behind library planning like the art of architecture may be one the examples have thousands of aspects there is no single way to solve the problem of the library building the college library building today is shaped around many of the topics which so far have been discussed at this conference in some ways this conference may be considered as significant a contribution to the planning of a college library building as the one which was held here eight years ago and devoted to the specific topic of library buildings trends and developments in undergraduate education the relation between the library and collegiate objectives and the nature of the book collection are all topics as pertinent for a college library building as are technical and administrative operations or as acoustical ceilings rubber tile floors and modem air treatment this statement is in no way intended to minimize the importance of making adequate provision for those library operations or to minimize the contribution which technology and new materials have made to the modern library building it is nearly a century since greenough and sullivan put into words the age old principle that form follows function that a library building should be planned for library work was the first point of agreement in  among librarians as to library architecture william m randall at the  institute said first study your needs for building in known functions to be fulfilled the principle of functionalism  john e burchard charles w david and julian p boyd eds planning the university library building a summary of discussions by librarians architects and engineers princeton princeton university press  on p  are listed nine of the still pertinent points of agreement among librarians as to library architect originally published by charles c soule in the library journal in  this volume based on a meeting of the cooperative committee on library building plans is a source for reference and study of the library although essentially concerned with the university library it is pertinent for the collegelibrary building as well  william ml randall the constitution of the modern library building in library buildings for library service papers presented before the library inistitute of the university of chicago august    ed iherman h fussler chicago american library association  
the college library building  expounded by librarians and architects has been the dominating influence on our library buildings now we have a conference on the functions of the library in the modern college out of these papers and discussions we should be able to plan and shape the library building of the modem college it was a c cutter in  who said that the architect is the natural enemy of the librarian as recently as  ralph ellsworth wrote for over a century architects have had their way perhaps librarians can be forgiven for daring to assume a belligerent attitude even in recent years there have been built far too many buildings on our campuses with little awareness of the library functions to be performed not to give some truth to these statements as one looks back over the literature on library buildings however the contributions by architects stand out prominently the boldness of labrouste in planning stacks for the bibliotheque nationale in the  and his use of an interior glass partition between the reading room and stack areas needs only to be mentioned to recall a whole line of architects who have been alert to the working functions of libraries the success of the cooperative committee on library building plans established in  was due as much to the participation of architects as to that of librarians the formal conferring on mutual problems by architects and libranrans in recent years at institute meetings and on other occasions is a step forward in library planning the tradition of conferences set by the cooperative committee has been carried on by the acrl library buildings committee in its annual institutes the example of inviting architects as well as administrators and building equipment engineers and manufacturers has resulted in continued co operation the unco operative architect today is about as rare as the untrained librarian robert muller in a recent review of talbot hamlin forms and functions of twentieth century architecture said that librarians reading these volumes will rid themselves of the false notion that a librarian idea of a library building must necessarily be in conflict with an architect there may be easier and lighter ways of arriving at this understanding than plowing through these four volumes but there are other good reasons for perusing these and similar studies in architecture as librarians it seems only just that we should understand some of the principles and practices of architecture if we in turn expect the architect for the library to read and understand the functions and modern practices of librarianship the preparation of a written program stating the functions of the library in full is another forward step for a librarian in the planning of a library gerould emphasized this point in his book on the college library building in  mr gerould said everyone has used libraries of course and in a general way knows what the building must contain there must be reading rooms stack  the librarian and the architect in planning the university library building p  the whole of chap viii of this monograph is devoted to this topic and has much sound advice  ralph e ellsworth determining factors in the evaluation of the modular plan for libraries couege and research libraries xiv april      sigfried giedion space time and architecture the growth of a new tradition d ed cambridge harvard university press  helen margaret reynolds university library buildings in united states   collge and research libraries xiv april      forms and functions of twentieth century architecture ed talbot f hamlin reviewed by robert h muller college and researchi libraries xv april   
 the library quarterly rooms an office for the librarian a few rooms miscalled seminars and possibly if one is very modern a browsing room but the dimension of these rooms and their relation each to the other is seldom given proper study a few notes together with the limit of cost are turned over to the architect and he is expected to produce a proper building since gerould time and due in part to his sound analytical study of the college library the written program for a library building has received continued emphasis how to draft the program and exactly what it should contain are still in the early stages of development ernest j reece has recently devoted a thorough study to programs their values and how to draft them which has been published in college and research libraries the program has grown out of the principle of functionalism in architecture and is welcomed by the architect in fact there have been occasions when no program was provided by the librarian or the college and the architect has proceeded to have one prepared as the four line staff with single notation has been developed by the composer into full orchestration for the musicians so the program is fast becoming a score with equal potentialities for the librarian or to make the analogy more direct the program as an instrument of planning may become as significant for the librarian as he turns to the architect for performance as the blueprint is for the architect as he turns over his work to the builder the fact that it may not have the exactness of the blueprint or musical notation does not lessen the influence which it has as a guide for the architect who can no longer be expected im the rush and complexity of our society even of that in our college communities to grasp fully and to analyze the library functions of any particular institution here is the challenge to the librarian which will require the whole of his training in librarianship a knowledge of his institution and a creative ability to express the functions of his institution in terms significant to his architect the program is more than a project to sell the library building to the administration or to help raise a million dollars the program should set forth the objectives of the library in relation to the teaching program and in terms of student and faculty needs for a library as well as in details of operations flow of work book capacities and air conditioning the key to its success may lie in understanding the institution on the one hand and architecture on the other as definitely and as simply as possible the librarian must express the purposes and functions of his particular library he may be aided by figures and charts most agree that he should not attempt to draw actual arrangements or design the style of architecture however is a matter for which preference may be indicated in fact the program may be used as the basis for selection of the architect trained in a particular style it is recognized that the so called modem architecture has become a style as pronounced as defined as any other style with all the restrictions disciplines limitations and blessings that we associate with the term under these circumstances the program becomes essential to an institution which wishes to be assured of a functioning library rather than a period piece  james thayer gerould tue college library building its planning and equipment new york charles scribner sons  p   ernest j reece library building programs how to draft them college and research libraries xiii july    i matthew nowicki origins and trends in modern architecture magazine of art xlvi november   
the college library building  in recent years a number of people because of interest and experience in library building have become experts serving as consultants library consultants architect consultants engineer equipment consultants and professional planners these men and women have a valuable role to play in the planning of a library building not all of us have the opportunity to plan a building or the aptitude to think in terms of spaces or blueprints it may be that the librarian is living almost too close to his own problems a survey by an outsider may help formulate the functions of a particular library with a clarity that the librarian at home often cannot command a consultant may save him from many a false start and as the program and planning develop prove a real economy to an institution consultants have learned through their own errors and successes as well as through those of others however they must be selected with as much care as the architect neutra in his new study survival through design devotes a chapter to consultants which he heads in explanation as follows the ested expertitty or just sour rises against innovation more often than the common man on the other side innovators frequently have one track minds and cannot comprehend all the doings of their own brain children the librarian can visit new library buildings and can read descriptive plans and programs of many others the value of these to the librarian is as real as the use of consultants but usimg new buildings as authority also has its dangers attendance at institutes where existing library buildings are criticized for their failures and successes and where new plans are presented for evaluation has many advantages at these meetings a librarian is helped to think in terms of space relations architectural styles and materials and to look at a plan or a blueprint more intelligently by such visits and attendance at conferences a librarian can learn about consultants and architects and have the opportunity to discuss his own problems with his colleagues the descriptive articles on new college libraries along with some analytical literature on library buildings give one some down to earth views of accomplishments and trends in the college library field almost all the articles on new buildings have mentioned the favorable site which was obtained for the library this usually was as centrally located as possible on established lines of student traffic or on lines contemplated for the future development of the college some allowance was usually given for possible expansion and the description often indicated whether this was to be vertical or horizontal the architect had in some cases actually made plans for such exi richard neutra survival through design new york oxford university press  the book contains a number of interesting and stimulating observations thus functionalism can turn into a superficial creed for extroverts but it can also be guided to honor the functions within our skin and the innermost life function may itself be a follower chap xv design never a harmless play with forms and colors changes outer life as well as our inner balances chap xliv u edna hanley byers comp a college and university library buildings bibliography  in acrl monograph no   pp   mrs byers is bringing this bibliography up to date in the forthcoming issue of the acrl monograph devoted to the proceedings of the  acrl buildings plans institute held at madison wisconsin ernest j reece building planning and equipment library trends i july    with bibliography for building trends see also robert h muller future library building trends among colleges and universities college and research libraries xii january    and j f vanderheyden contemporary building planning as it appears to a european librarian college and research libraries x october   
 the library quarterly pansion erectimg only the first unit of a much larger building the entrance was usually at street or ground level or with but a few steps there was one public entrance or at most two the old monumentality or heroism of many former libraries seemed completely absent this did not mean that the buildings were without dignity and attractiveness the efficiency of the warehouse with its almost perfect functionalism had made few gains on the college campus problems of landscaping and even of parking were considered more often than not the library conformed in style of architecture with other buildings of the campus rather than striking out in bold new lines even those buildings which were frankly modern in style seemed to make subtle reference in materials or lines to neighboring older buildings except for the fact that some buildings were labeled the library and were centrally located and new it would be necessary still for a visitor to inquire for the library the building had acquired no especially uniform features or characteristics which its functions gave to its design in fact the variety of fronts entrancesl lines and treatments has shown a healthy refusal to copy the designs of other colleges although several descriptions of new libraries apologized so to speak for the traditional style or defended their modern lines few failed to emphasize the successful planning and arrangement of the interiors most librarians expressed real satisfaction in what had been accomplished for the successful operation of library activities through their buildings the key word in most of the planning today is flexibility it has become almost synonymous with functionalism flexibility usually refers to the ability to make major changes in the building arrangement adaptability is the word used to refer usually to the ability to make minor changes in arrangement of furniture and equipment expansibility is another element which is characteristic of flexibility the problem for the librarian is to determine as nearly as possible the functions which are most likely to be changed in a building over a period of years or possibly seasonally for example during the regular terms the student body may number a thousand or so undergraduates but during the summer months the enrolment may drop to four or five hundred or jump to three thousand and use of the library may be much more in the pattern required for conferences and institutes the building should be adaptable to any such changes and the resulting necessary economies it may be necessary to build only a part of a projected total building allowing for growing book collections and increased enrolment the greatest need for flexibility lies in the relation of the teaching program to the library the changes here result from the introduction of new schools and departments or shifts to new programs some consultants in general education have estimated an increase in library use of as much as four or five times in the institutions which have made the change from the traditional liberal arts curriculum for some the modular type of construction seems to answer many of the requirements for flexibility demanded by our libraries although in architecture the module is among the most restrictive of forms as a building principle it has been successfully used in georgian french provincial and collegiate gothic as well as in modern it lends itself to the development of our open arrangements of books and readers emphasizing the horizontal development of interiors it appears to have economies especially where the needs of
the college library building  readers have become of equal importance with the book collections or even greater the danger may come as a unit size is developed which is economical for shelving books efficient for chair and table arrangements and yet fails to meet space requirements for readers as each module tends to become adaptable for all functions including those new requirements for audio visual materials and economical storage areas the cost per unit may become too high and the function for any one purpose never be adequately fulfilled the crystallizing and resulting standardization of the module may be its own death modular planning however is an exciting development which may remove certain rigidity from interior arrangements and used with modification give some flexibility rather than exactitude to library areas many college libraries have used this type of construction and it has many enthusiastic supporters it is well worth visiting several of the buildings which have used this technique to obtain some idea of its possibilities and its weaknesses in recent years it has received very careful analytical study flexibility it must be remembered may be obtained in various ways m architecture and modular construction does not necessarily guarantee flexibility for all functions management engineers have contributed much to the efficiency of our buildings and have made careful studies from which many good standards have been developed costs are being analyzed in square feet of space available for library functions rather than in cubic feet of a building lines of traffic controls location of offices stairs elevators book storage ventilation maintenance lighting and a whole list of other details have received and are continuing to receive careful study there is little excuse for those with a new building to have inefficient or poor operational facilities new materials such as glass acoustical tile cinder blocks and rubber tile floors have been used with success in the improvement of buildings obsolescence of many of our college libraries has been due as much to improper study of relations of areas and offices as to lack of space for books and readers the interior of the college library building has become more open in recent years not only physically but also in relation to readers use of material and their freedom to move about controls and services have been centralized usually by an entrance and instead of rooms there are areas which tend to be without exact limits as they flow into each other most stacks if there are stacks in the old sense at all are of open access although in a few descriptions of new buildings it is timidly implied that these stacks can be closed if necessary more often stacks and reading areas are together with no permanent physical barriers of any kind between the books and the readers the arrangement although open for the libraries tends to retain central areas for reference circulaj ralph e ellsworth determining factors in the evaluation of the modular plan for libraries college and research libraries xiv april     angus macdonald has promised i understand a monograph on this subject a check through library literatre will turn up a nurnber of other studies on modular construction  angus macdonald building design for library management library trends ii january    some other recent articles on management are donald coney management in college and university libraries library trends i july    with bibliography and maurice f tauber t d morris and robert e kingery management improvements in libraries college and research libraries xv april    see also keyes d metcalf spatial problems in university libraries library trends ii april   
 the library quarterly tion serials order and cataloging in the traditional pattern for operations this includes an area for reserve a few have dared to put the reserves along with each subject field throughout the library but on the whole the reserve room or its equivalent is still present in most of the new college libraries despite the lamentations of some librarians a variation of the open development is to divide the library into three or more large subject divisions or areas of knowledge each of these such as the humanities the social sciences or the natural sciences has its own open arrangement for reference periodicals reserves and stacks with a subject trained librarian in charge this development seems particularly successful for the medium sized university where much emphasis is given to the undergraduate teaching program and the practice has grown especially in the middle and far west the divisional type of arrangement although used in part by a few small college libraries has not become popular among the liberal arts colleges the subject departmental arrangement in rooms has practically disappeared except where a location may call for a service outside the main building new buildings offer many colleges the opportunity to centralize scattered collections and departmental libraries except for a few dormitory laboratory or memorial collections centralization has won approval on most college campuses not only is it efficient from a management point of view but the gathering of all fields of knowledge into one working collection has value as a teaching instrument in the liberal arts or general education of students more consideration for the undergraduates library needs is now given by the larger universities in their new buildings most have set aside at least a single large room and have provided space for a staff to service undergraduates and develop collections of special interest to them the most significant recognition seems to be in providing a completely separate building developed from a program of careful study of the problems of the undergraduates in the university and the awareness of their needs as distinguished from those of the graduate and research students teaching with books the laboratory workshop the library as a teaching instrument and the library in college instruction are all ideas as well as titles of publications which have been influential in the planning of buildings the integration between library operations and  william r lansberg current trends in college reserve room college and research libraries xi april      there are many articles on divisional libraries a few of which are patricia marvin circulation in the divisional library the new plan of service couege and research libraries xii july     percy d morrison variation of the subject divisional plan at oregon college and research libraries xiv april    j r blanchard departmental libraries in divisional plan university libraries couege and research libraries xiv july   see bibliography p  john d chapman ralph h hopp and arthur j vernixthe divisional library at nebraska two aspects college and researchi libraries xv april     arthur m mcanally stanley e gwynn philip j mcniff william s dix and wyman s parker library service to undergraduates a symposium college and research libraries xiv july    harvie branscomb teaching with books chicago association of american colleges and american library association  committee on the new library a laboratory workshop library for princeton princeton the committee  university library planning committee the library as a teaching instrument iowa city the committee  louis r wilson el al the library in couege instruction new york h w wilson co 
the college library building  the teaching program has become an objective it may be easier to talk of these principles than to translate them into blueprints also it seems easier to criticize blueprints from the point of view of management than of academic objectives it is necessary however to look critically at plans to see whether the general principles sought by librarians are actually incorporated in the building it may be scanned in two ways from the point of view of members of the faculty and from that of the student an awareness of faculty needs has been expressed in a number of ways faculty studies are now a part of most collegelibrary buildings just as they are accepted in the university there is hardly a new college library that does not provide some conference seminar or to be more accurate classroom space for those faculty members who find teaching with books in the library a stimulating experience some colleges are providing lounges for faculty as well as for the staff within the library there may be hope that some of the faculty members may wish to work there for as many hours as does the library staff at any rate members of the faculty are now welcomed with facilities which have been especially planned for them the library collection itself has become more useful for faculty research needs microfilm photostat microphotography photoreproductions and other developments have made it possible for the scholar now to conduct much of his work in the limited collection of the college library the development of interlibrary loan and tools for bibliographical control within the means of a college library has tended to bring the college professor into the library he no longer needs a holiday or vacation to get the opportunity to dash to a metropolitan or university collection another development in faculty library relations is the status of the library staff in most of our buildings there is little question of the administrative importance of the librarian his office is usually furnished with all the requisites of an executive i know of one college librarian who did not want such an office for hinmself but was overruled he now has a most beautiful office but i understand seldom uses it except to show to visitors he did not wish to work in the isolation of an executive as the library staff takes its position alongside the teaching faculty the new buildings are recognizing the academic functions of the librarian as distinct from administrative or from clerical and semiprofessional socalled housekeeping operations members of college faculties are human in often failing to see anything but clerical routines or administrative duties in library work if i remember correctly one library deliberately provided a glass wall for the office of each librarian so that faculty members could see the librarians actually working with books just as they themselves might do desks are replacing counters in public areas and adequate office space for cataloging bibliography and book selecting on the part of the library staff is being provided in some instances the space is the envy of classroom faculty members who sometimes wistfully recall that they once had thought of becoming librarians a number of developments have sharpened the librarian awareness and ability to control problems of the ever  l williamson relating the library to the classroom some specific suggestions college and research libraries xlv april     frank a lundy faculty rank of professional librarians couege and research libraries xii january april     
 the library quarterly increasing size of the book collection weeding the collection of little used materials and actual removal of dead wood is now an established practice the college library is no longer fearful of unlimited growth it may now give up many things which its faculty would never have permitted ten or twenty years ago economical areas for storage and for compact shelving now make possible the holding of materials for a period to test their usefulness without sacrificing the openness and freedom of the general collections the co operative development of economical storage areas for a community or region is helping the college library to meet many of the specialized demands of faculty or honor students and to free space for undergraduate needs the most striking recognition of readers in the new libraries is the care and taste with which the building is now furnished a generous use of color in all shades has become a common practice we read of such colors as silver birch royal violet yellow leaf byzantine blue bittersweet dew mixture pinkie and slate gray or thunderbolt the students like these new colors and some faculty members give approval the furniture is carefully selected for comfort even in reserve rooms there are occasional pieces inviting informality and suitable for long periods of reading the arrangement has been considered for its attractiveness as well as for its efficiency green plants framed pictures and window draperies are part of the decoration the librarian with the help of the library equipment houses has given beauty and smartness as well as utility to the furnishings an institutional designer has been consulted for a number of new buildings some architects have accepted this responsibility early in the planning stage recognizing that the success of a new building will depend as much on the interior furnishings as on the design and style of the building there have been some studies on the relation between environment and work in libraries which may give more than just artistic reasons for use of color quiet floors translucent or clear partitions and lighting arrangements from the point of view of the students it has been recognized that too large collections such as those in many of the major universities can actually be a handicap to undergraduates the college library no longer wants its shelves filled with little used or obsolescent materials moreover with open arrangement these somewhat dead materials become very conspicuous and are usually not too attractive to undergraduates as they are encouraged to work among the collections college libraries are becoming larger but the emphasis is directed more to the working needs of students in use of library materials rather than to ever increasing collections which crowd out the reader the percentage of the student body to be served at any one time has been increased students are also provided with carrels typing areas talking or group working rooms smoking privileges and other amenities frank lloyd wright in speaking of public library buildings recently said that they should be unpretentious in human scale designed for comfort and enjoyblanche p mccrum helmer webb and rutherford d rogers optimum size of libraries a symposium college and research libraries xi april     these colors have been quoted from price gilbert library georgia institute of technology dedication program november   atlanta georgia many other striking and original colors and combinations are referred to frequently in articles on new library buildings for colleges as well as universities
the college library building  ment of people who love books a happy place with music and a pleasant homelikeness man as a physiological measure in architecture has been receiving continued emphasis since the library has freed its books from medieval chains it has learned to handle many new media and other forms of communications some of the functions of these new media are to be discussed later at this conference although the library may not be designated as the communications center for the college it is often able to help with uses of new materials for teaching such as music and language disks films and film strips tapes as well as maps prints and other audio visual teaching aids some libraries have admitted what is called the living book by providing areas for lectures and group programs this may be following the footsteps of the public libraries and their branches in providing such services for the community all such programs offer a number of problems in library administration the library in the modem college is accepting slowly the need for additional areas for students and faculty who wish to work in groups with many new media of communications as well as for space for the individual to work in quiet with a single volume the small lecture hall or auditorium has appeared in many college libraries it is often associated with areas for projecting films and a center for photoelectric communication equipment how educational television is to be brought into the college library is still a question but i should not be surprised to see some college libraries already providing space for this i only hope that translating machines will not get so small or cheap that the library will be asked to plug some of these into the shelf for the foreign language dictionaries there is another area of activity which is becoming more important to the college library and for which college buildings are providing space this is in the field of exhibitions public relations and publications the strategic location of the library gives it an opportunity to operate an exhibition program which can have real value for the library and community a separate gallery on an upper floor by a special collection is not the usual treatment and is seldom found in the college library space for this activity is right up in front and located at points of heavy traffic in fact by the use of glass the whole front is sometimes used to advantage for a continual live exhibit of the whole library or an attractive part of it in action for all who pass by unfortunately most exhibition equipment is rather formal and heavy or built into corridors or walls so as to be rigid and not easily adaptable to changing programs of varying size the exhibition areas are like the procrustean bed in which each victim is killed because it is too large or too small moreover most exhibition equipment is too expensive the college library needs to control its naterials but it does not specialize in illuminated manuscripts incunabula or other rarities requiring the dignity or security of heavy bronze cases george nelson in the comments and introduction to his new book display has some ideas which are quite applicable to college libraries with exs janice kee let have good libraries not big ones says frank lloyd wright ala bulktin xlvi october    george nelson ed display new york whitney publications  the following introductory note seems pertinent it is not easy to express these feelings in permanent buildings today there is the conservation of owners of building codes of the fha of banks of trade unions but in temporary exposition why not the need to be practical does not exist the necessity to build inexpensively does the designer can ease up a bit and

the college library building  brarian knowledge of what goes on within and without the walls of his own library this implies more than ever before a knowledge and appreciation of books it also includes the ability to understand the needs of the college community as a whole and of the individuals struggling to learn and to communicate the best which has survived in society although the college librarian with a new building to plan has many a headache and heartache in store for him he also has a much envied opportunity of providing a resource which in the long run will improve the quality of work that goes on inside the building and out from it to members of the faculty and the student body
