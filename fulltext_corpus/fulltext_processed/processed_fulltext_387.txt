research notes resources for scholars four quaker collections in the united states part  earlham college and haverford college edited by thomas d hamm few religious groups so relatively small in numbers have exercised the influence of the religious society of friends or quakers this series describes the possibilities for research in the holdings of four quaker colleges in the united states part  published in the january  issue of the library quarterly describes the collections at guilford and swarthmore colleges in dealing with quaker history and materials some knowledge of quaker terminology is vital among friends an individual congregation is known as a meeting one or more such meetings also make up a monthly meeting the basic business unit of the society with the authority to receive and disown members hold property and solemnize marriages two or more monthly meetings form a quarterly meeting a larger geographical unit holding sessions four times a year several quarterly meetings in turn make up a yearly meeting the final authority at least before  for business doctrinal and disciplinary affairs at each of these levels until the late nineteenth century men and women held separate business meetings each with its own officers and minutes this segregation of the sexes was intended to remove women from a situation in which they might be intimidated by the men from participation after  most quaker groups moved toward joint business meetings the friends collection at earlham college thomas d hamm the friends collection at earlham college dates back to  when after almost fifteen years of planning indiana yearly meeting of  archivist and assistant professor of history lilly library earlham college richmond indiana  library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved     
 the library quarterly friends orthodox opened a boarding school in richmond indiana for the guarded religious education of its youth and to provide convenient and suitable housing for visiting quakers during the annual sessions of the yearly meeting originally a secondary school the friends boarding school in  made the transition to collegiate status and took the name of earlham college after the home of the eminent english quaker minister and philanthropist joseph john gurney   pp     from its beginning as a combination boarding school and dormitory for quaker dignitaries earlham has housed a large collection of quaker books and manuscripts most of these were part of the indiana yearly meeting library of reference kept at the boarding school near richmond indiana a group of over five hundred seventeenthand eighteenth century quaker works donated in the s by british friends the books purchased by the boarding school committee in  for the use of the students also included a number of friends works all were housed with the rest of the college library in earlham hall the campus only building until the s and after that in lindley hall the largest administration and classroom building on campus until a library building was erected with funding from andrew carnegie in   pp    at the time of the erection of the new library building the college librarian was harlow lindley   who would later head both the indiana historical commission and the ohio state archaeological and historical society lindley was also the college american historian and apparently made the first systematic efforts on the part of anyone associated with the college to collect and preserve quaker manuscripts and documents it was also lindley who apparently located the oldest records of the college such as the minutes of the boarding school committee and moved them into a special section of the library thus many of the college most important nineteenth century records escaped destruction when lindley hall was devastated by fire in   pp    after lindley left to head the ohio historical society in  the college archives and the friends collection continued to grow although with what the college historian termed benign neglect in  history professor thomas d s bassett was named the college first archivist when he left a year later he was succeeded by opal thornburg    thornburg was an earlham graduate who had held a variety of administrative positions with the college simultaneously with assuming the position of archivist she was given the task of writing the college history as a necessary prelude to her research she located and brought
research notes  into the library a variety of records from various offices on campus she also undertook the first efforts to set up an organizational system for the college archives the quaker manuscripts and the friends books and pamphlets in addition she supervised the installation of these holdings in the college new lilly library in  today the friends collection and the college archives have five major components the college archives the friends manuscripts series the friends book and pamphlet collection the indiana yearly meeting archives and the genealogical collection the college archives most of the material in the earlham college archives is by its nature of interest primarily to those pursuing topics relating to the history of the college or to the history of higher education over the years the archives have functioned as a sort of campus museum thus its holdings are strong on campus memorabilia bits of charred wood from the lindley hall fire of  china from the original dining hall old debate team trophies president joseph moore   inkwell minutes and records of various college organizations from the board of trustees to the faculty meeting to student groups are housed here as are complete collections of virtually all campus publications some of the manuscript collections of faculty and administrators however do bear on larger topics mainly because of earlham character as a quaker college the president office files to  were lost in the lindley hall fire and most of those from  to  fell victim to the combined efforts of a janitor canaries and a plague of rodents in the s but the files of presidents william c dennis   and thomas e jones   are complete and open for research of particular interest in the dennis papers are files dealing with the enrollment of japanese americans from the west coast during world war ii and the involvement of dennis and other faculty and students in groups opposing american entry into the war the jones papers reflect the tensions that the college experienced during the mccarthy era jones built an outstanding faculty after world war ii by hiring pacifist academics quaker and non quaker who because of their position as conscientious objectors during the war were not acceptable to most institutions the involvement of these men and women in liberal and left wing causes especially antiwar and antisegregation ones and the refusal of some students to register for the draft made for conflict with the local community and even with some indiana quakers also of significance for researchers are the personal papers of several
