labor market segmentation and librarian salaries nancy a van house librarian earnings functions have been found to differ by type of library and by sex within library type the present study uses segmented labor market theory to explain how the structure of the library labor market may determine salary differences by type of library data on the public academic and school library labor markets are used to show that the library labor market is segmented by type of library that this segmentation contributes to the observed differences in earnings functions by type of library and that the segmentation of the library labor market reflects segmentation of the labor market generally a secondary result of this study is that it shows the value of intraoccupational studies like this one for a full understanding of labor market segmentation by finding evidence of labor market segmentation at the intraoccupational level it shows that the more usual approach to segmented labor markets comparing entire occupations or industries may obscure important differences to attract and retain qualified people an occupation must offer adequate and equitable salaries research has found that librarians salaries however are relatively low  and differ markedly by sex   and by type of library  not only do salary levels differ but the factors that determine librarians earnings and the influence of each factor on salary differ by type of library   and by sex within library type  librarians are generally considered to belong to a single occupation they are for the most part trained in the same ala accredited library  the data reported are drawn from the career profile of american library association personal members based on a survey conducted by leigh s estabrook and kathleen m heim for the american library association committee on the status of women in librarianship with support from a bailey k howard ala goals award this assistance is gratefully acknowledged  school of library and information studies university of california berkeley berkeley california  library quarterly vol  no  pp   x  by the university of chicago all rights reserved      
 the library quarterly schools and receive the same mls degrees yet the type of library in which a person is employed is a key determinant of his or her career earnings and men and women differ in their career earnings partly because they tend to be employed in different types of library at least two possible explanations for differences in earnings functions across library types can be proposed first the work andor working conditions may differ resulting in a need to pay higher salaries to get librarians to take some jobs filer  for example proposed compensating differentials to explain part of the male female wage gap in the work force as a whole men may be working in jobs that are more difficult less pleasant or otherwise less desirable and so may demand higher salaries to compensate for the lower nonmonetary utility of their jobs clearly librarians in different work settings perform somewhat different functions but they receive their basic training together in mls programs implying marked similarities in their work as well nevertheless differences in work andor working conditions may explain at least part of the type of library differences second the structure of the library labor market may help to explain the differences although librarianship appears to be a single occupation it may not be if the library labor market is divided into segments that are insulated from each other preventing the free movement of employees from one to another differential compensation schemes can develop and persist resulting in different earnings for people with similar qualifications performing similar work in the different segments in this case earnings differences would stem not from differences in worker qualifications or the work performed although these factors may operate as well but from the sector in which a person is employed both of these explanations merit investigation the present study is concerned only with the second the structure of the library labor market and its effect on earnings differentials across types of libraries the causes of earnings differences by sex within type of library and the possibility of compensating differentials across library types must also be addressed as part of a comprehensive inquiry into the determination of librarian salaries but are beyond the scope of the present study the present study addresses the following questions is the library labor market segmented by type of library if so what are the characteristics of the different markets that contribute to earnings differences how do the characteristics of these segments affect earnings and finally does segmentation within the library labor market reflect segmentation in the economy as a whole segmented labor market theory has been proposed to explain differences in labor market outcomes as a result of the structure of the labor market this study will examine the
librarian salaries  implications of this theory for librarianship as well as the implications of the data on librarianship for the theory a major point of discussion in segmented labor market slm research is the basis on which labor markets are segmented empirically this translates into a question of the appropriate unit of analysis industry occupation industry occupation cell or something else entirely a secondary purpose of this study is to look for evidence of segmentation at the intraoccupational level in this case within librarianship if librarianship is segmented then the more usual approach to slm research comparing entire occupations or industries may obscure important differences and intraoccupational studies like this one will be shown to be necessary for a full understanding of labor market segmentation segmented labor market theory segmented labor market theory attempts to explain group differences in earnings and occupation specifically but not exclusively by race and sex that remain after human capital variables such as education and experience are taken into account slm theory posits that the labor market is divided into segments or sectors with different employment and wagesetting processes barriers to movement prevent workers from crossing segments and so allow these differences to persist a key point of slm theory is that these sectors differ on some measure of job quality or desirability including but not necessarily limited to earnings and that workers are not randomly distributed across the sectors  the result is that workers with similar qualifications performing the same or similar work will be paid differently that is the coefficients on the relevant worker characteristics in the earnings functions will differ in contrast neoclassical labor market theory would say that workers have complete information and mobility differences in earnings functions within an occupation would draw workers from the low wage to the high wage sector eventually eliminating the differences salary differences would be due to differences in worker qualifications assuming that the work performed is similar not to differences in how those characteristics are evaluated  slm theory began by assuming that there were two labor market segments dual labor markets one primary the other secondary  in the primary sector worker skill is important to the production process employers encourage worker attachment and try to reduce turnover training and experience are valued the primary sector is characterized
 the library quarterly by high wages good working conditions employment stability rewards for training and experience opportunities for advancement and higher status in the secondary sector worker skill is less important thus this sector offers lower wages poorer working conditions less opportunity for advancement higher turnover and less status slm research continues to grapple with the question of the basis on which markets are segmented and hence with the ultimate number of segments the primary secondary duality has become more of a continuum with a varying number of segments in between depending on the researcher part of the confusion arises from the lack of theoretical development and inconsistencies in conceptualization and taxonomies   the two major theoretical approaches are dual economy which says that industries are segmented and dual or segmented labor market which says labor markets are segmented empirically this translates into debates over the unit of analysis and the measures used to define the sectors and to test for segmentation various researchers have used or proposed as the appropriate unit of analysis the worker  job  industry  firm  and occupation  the measurement problem is that of avoiding redundancy between the measures used to define the sectors and those used to test for segmentation an equally important question that has received less attention is how and why workers are assigned to segments although slm theory began as an attempt to explain race and sex differences in occupational outcomes the choice of these particular characteristics as the bases on which workers are channeled into segments is not necessarily inherent in slm theory the theoretical development and empirical testing of slm theory continues amid much controversy however in a recent survey of research directions in the economics of education blaug  identified labor market segmentation as a key challenge internal labor markets the concept of internal labor markets is closely related to that of segmented labor markets an internal labor market ilm is a set of bureaucratic rules and procedures that govern how people get access to jobs and the reward systems of those jobs relative to one another   an ilm creates a job ladder advancement is generally facilitated by some combination of education formal and informal on the job training and seniority ilms create motivation and commitment by rewarding performance longevity and investment in human capital  at the same time they bar newcomers from entering the market at any but the lowest level thereby erecting barriers to movement across labor market segments
librarian salaries  factors that have been identified as contributing to the development of ilms include tasks that require a high degree of firm specific knowledge tasks that are high in uncertainty and low in routine with a high reliance on employee discretion and judgment and high competition for labor  althauser and kalleberg  have argued for a broadening of the concept of the internal labor market to create a taxonomy of five kinds of labor market firm internal labor market film the film is a job ladder internal to a firm entry is limited generally to the lowest level jobs and once employed a worker tends to move up within the organization this is the traditional ilm as defined by most research firm labor market flm the flm also operates within a firm and offers job security and shelter from external competition but has no job ladder once employed by a firm the worker remains but the rewards are only for seniority if that with little or no increase in skill or responsibility occupational internal labor market oilm an oilm operates within an occupation not a firm it has a job ladder with rewards for increased skill and experience but it crosses firms people tend to move from organization to organization within the occupation occupational labor market olm an olm also occurs within an occupation not a firm entry requires specialized skills or knowledge acquired only by education or training however the occupation has no ilm that is no career ladder for example many health occupations require certification limiting entry but offer few or no prospects for advancement employees move laterally among firms within the occupation secondary labor market the secondary labor market lacks job ladders development of skills or knowledge and investment in training by either employee or employer salaries are relatively low entry is fairly easy and workers tend to move in and out of the labor market and from one firm to another approaches to research on slms two methods have been used to test for the existence of segmented labor markets  the first is factor analysis of job andor worker characteristics which empirically clusters jobs or workers looking for underlying dimensions that presumably reflect the segmentation predicted by slm theory the second and more common method consists of dividing occupations andor industries into two or more sectors and testing for differences in their wage equations that are consistent with slm theory the problem with this approach is in defining the sectors while avoiding redundancy between the factors used to define the sectors and to test for segmentation   several researchers have suggested that it is necessary to use a more disaggregated unit of analysis than either industry or occupation baron and bielby  have proposed the firm althauser and kalleberg  the occupation industry cell that is people employed in the same occupa
 the library quarterly tion within a single industry althauser and kalleberg as well as baron and bielby argue that it is not necessarily true that all members of a given occupation or industry are in the same labor market segment analysis at either the firm or industry occupation cell level would avoid the related problems of determining the appropriate unit of analysis industry vs occupation and of redundancy in the measures baron and bielby  also argue for the importance of context in understanding the meaning of the independent variables in a salary function the same variable may represent different processes in different contexts for example education may represent training in one situation and credentialing for example this person has the selfdiscipline to come to school every day in another the more aggregated the data the more likely such confusion this may account for some of the inconsistencies in the empirical findings of segmented labor market research  the present study the implications of the above discussion for the present research are as follows first segmentation of the library labor market by type of library would mean that movement across the segments is limited interfering with the adjustment of supply and demand and creating salary inequities librarians with the same training performing similar work could be paid differently in the different sectors librarian surpluses and shortages could develop in the different segments barriers to worker movement would prevent the market from making needed adjustments the mere identification of the existence of such market barriers would be helpful in understanding the dynamics of supply and demand in librarianship second if the library market is segmented it would be useful to describe more clearly the reward processes within each segment althauser and kalleberg taxonomy with its explicit treatment of both occupation and firm would seem an appropriate taxonomy to use to describe the library profession if the library labor market is segmented and if its pattern of segmentation reflects that proposed by segmented labor market theory this would simultaneously add to the evidence for that theory and suggest that slm theory may increase our understanding of the library labor market if the library labor market appears to be consistent with the predictions derived from slm theory then we may be able to draw further inferences from slm theory to librarianship in particular within librarianship differences in earnings between men and women are due to a large extent to differences in the types of library in which
librarian salaries  they are employed with women concentrated in the lower paying sectors  what remains to be explained is the process by which the sexes differentially choose  or are assigned to types of library slms may offer some insight to this problem finally research at the type of library level can contribute to the debate within slm research over the appropriate unit of analysis by demonstrating the usefulness of industry occupation cell instead of assuming that occupations andor industries are homogeneous the present study tests for heterogeneity within librarianship at the occupationindustry level the problem of redundancy between the criteria used to classify industries andor occupations and those used to measure segmentation is eliminated the present analysis uses evidence on intraoccupational movement among librarians to test for segmentation it also uses the librarians earnings functions developed by van house  to test for differences in wage equations that are consistent with slm theory the earlier study was concerned with the effect of worker characteristics or supply factors on earnings it developed earnings functions by sex and type of library and tested a human capital supply based explanation of distribution of librarians by sex and type of library the present study uses the earnings functions developed previously to investigate the possibility of a segmented library labor market and to test the effect of labor market structure or demand factors on earnings the two studies together address the two sides of salary determination supply and demand the data the data are drawn from estabrook and heim  survey of  ala individual members excluding lay that is nonlibrarian student and trustee members  they received  usable responses  from women  from men for a  percent response rate librarians who belong to a professional association may have a higher degree of career commitment and be in higher level jobs than those who do not but no data on this exist only white mlsdegree holders employed full time in public academic and school libraries are included in the present analysis the sample size varies because data were not present for all variables for all respondents table  shows descriptive data and sample sizes for the cases included in the earnings functions this sample size was  male  see van house  for a more comprehensive discussion of the data and the implications of using a professional association sample

 the library quarterly school librarians and respondents in other work settings for example special libraries are excluded because of their small numbers minorities including blacks asians and hispanics are excluded because there were few of them and because they may have different earnings functions from whites   segmentation of the library labor market among the three library labor market sectors that are the subject of this analysis academic school and public i hypothesize a continuum that generally reflects a primarysecondary division librarians are by most definitions members of the primary labor market because of their education presumably education represents both an investment in human capital and a barrier to entry osterman   classified librarians in the lower tier of the primary sector in his three segment categorization primary sector upper tier primary sector lower tier secondary sector one would not expect therefore to find a true secondary labor market within libraries however if the different types of library correspond to different labor market segments along a continuum that generally reflects the primary secondary division we would expect to find the following zucker and rosenstein  have reviewed and summarized the hypotheses that commonly result from segmented labor market theory these hypotheses are adapted from theirs first if the library labor market is segmented there should be little movement across types of library  second there should be differences in earnings determination wages should be higher in the type of library most like a primary sector  the earnings functions should also differ a key tenet of slm theory is that the returns to human capital related variables will be less in the secondary sector the primary sector should evidence greater returns to additional education    and higher rewards for experience in the profession and for tenure in one organization   differences in worker characteristics should also appear librarians in the primary sector should show more experience tenure and education  the career patterns of workers in the two sectors should also differ with those in the primary sector showing higher upward mobility   segmented labor market theory has been used to explain segregation by race andor sex although labor markets may be segmented without segregation the question of how workers are assigned to segments is separate from that of whether segments exist nevertheless it is generally assumed  that women and minorities are more often employed in the secondary sector we would therefore expect to find fewer women in
librarian salaries  the segment more like a primary market although this is not a necessary condition of segmented labor markets findings the first question is whether librarians are limited in their ability to cross segments table  compares respondents current employment with the type of library in which they held their most recent previous job the results indicate little movement across sectors similar findings are reported in the library human resources study  p  once a librarian enters a labor market segment he or she is unlikely to change the next question is whether earnings levels and functions differ as predicted because the segments have already been defined as corresponding to types of libraries the question is do the earnings functions differ by type of library and if so do the different segments show the differences expected between primary and secondary labor markets salary functions table  were developed by sex and type of library except for men employed in school libraries of whom there were too few the dependent variable was annual salary the independent variables were worker characteristics including number of children and several measures of human capital experience tenure in present job and additional degrees beyond the mls job characteristics including level in the organization number of professionals and nonprofessionals supervised and publications and professional activity and size of organization these were the variables drawn from a slightly larger original set that proved to be significant for more than one type of library details on the development of the salary functions can be found in van house  all possible pairs of regressions were tested and found to be statistically significantly different from one another at the  percent level mean salaries for men and for women are highest in academic libraries see table  for men academic libraries show higher returns on experience and additional education than do public libraries for women the differences between public and academic libraries are fewer with additional education significant for women in public libraries and professional activity and publications for those in academic libraries the earnings function for women in school libraries however shows rewards only for tenure in current job and for number of nonprofessionals supervised turning to the characteristics of the workers in the different types of library table  men in academic libraries have more experience longer tenure in their current jobs and more education than those in public libraries women in school libraries have less experience than their colleagues in either public or academic libraries but somewhat longer

 the library quarterly tenure in their current job academic women are the most professionally active have published the most and have more education in addition to the mls degree the results point toward a continuum of library types academic libraries appear to be the most like a primary sector more inclined to have an internal labor market with higher salaries greater rewards for experience and human capital and more experienced and professionally active employees school libraries are most like a secondary segment with few rewards for human capital investment or achievement public libraries are somewhat in between but lean toward primary sector like behavior the differences between academic and public libraries are more striking for men than for women the relative numbers of men and women employed in the different sectors follow this same pattern with fewer women in academic libraries and more in school libraries firn and occupational labor markets the factors discussed in the preceding section test for the existence of library labor market segments reflecting a primary secondary continuum it appears that academic and public libraries are structured more like the primary sector with internal labor markets than are school libraries the analysis can be carried further however using althauser and kalleberg taxonomy  table  has shown that librarians rarely move across type of library lines contributing to differences in type of library markets the more freely librarians move across organizations within library types however the more homogeneous the type of library market is likely to be if however librarians tend to stay within an organization for example school librarians may move between the positions of teacher and librarian in one school or district then the market within which they are operating may not be the library occupation but rather the industry within which their libraries are situated the next question therefore is whether the mobility patterns of librarians reflect one or more of althauser and kalleberg types of markets  and whether these differ by type of library given that all of our subjects are librarians with mls degrees we have by definition no pure secondary labor market however it is possible that within a type of library there exists an occupational labor market olm an olm would show no signs of an internal labor market that is little or no upward mobility or returns to experience tenure or education on the other hand an occupational internal labor market oilm would show upward movement within the occupation but not within a single library with returns to experience and education a sector consisting of firm internal labor markets films would
librarian salaries  show little or no movement across organizations but upward movement within the organization and returns to experience tenure and education similarly a firm labor market flm would show low worker turnover that is continuing employment within one organization but no upward mobility and no returns to experience tenure or education in contrast to the olm workers in an flm should show a relative tendency to stay in one organization estabrook and heim  did not formulate their study with althauser and kalleberg  taxonomy in mind however respondents were asked to typify their career patterns over time and the choices presented to them correspond rouighly to althauser and kalleberg market types table  presents the results same position same organization denotes a stagnant career pattern similar position same organization represents lateral movement within the same organization that is at best a firm labor market with no upward mobility different position same organization includes films that is movement presumably some of which is upward within the same firm similar position different organization includes occupational labor markets that is movement across organizations but without upward mobility different position different organization represents movement both hierarchically and organizationally that is an occupational internal labor market of course not all such movement is up a career ladder but some portion of it is among school librarians  percent report working in the same or similar position within one or more organizations that is possibly an table  career patrern by type of library and sex  academic public school career m f all m f all f pa iern        same position same organization        similar position same organization        different position same organization        similar position different organization        different position different organization        notenumbers in parentheses equal sample size

librarian salaries  althauser and kalleberg taxonomy  which distinguishes occupational and firm markets with and without internal labor markets is a useful expansion on ilms that helps us further to describe and understand the different segments the evidence on earnings functions and on librarian mobility indicates that academic and public libraries function as occupational internal labor markets with job ladders that cross organizational boundaries these job ladders serve to insulate the segments from one another by limiting entry and regulating salaries and advancement school libraries however show no evidence of job ladders they appear to be an occupational labor market with barriers to entry the mls or equivalent and in some cases teaching or school library credentials but with little hierarchical movement once past the barrier these findings are significant in several ways for our understanding of the library labor market first primary sector jobs are more financially rewarding over the employee working life they pay more and offer the worker greater opportunities to increase his or her earnings potential through human capital investment such as education and training therefore sector assignment is an important determinant of lifetime earnings differences research into librarian salary differences must address the issue of how librarians come to choose or to be assigned to sectors this is especially important to an understanding of malefemale salary differences since the sexes are distributed disproportionately among library types second librarianship is shown to follow the pattern of segmentation in the labor force as a whole the continuing research into labor market segmentation therefore is relevant to the study of the library labor market the basic premise of slm theory is that occupational attainment is a result not solely of individual qualifications and effort but also of labor market structure this is an important point in understanding librarians occupational outcomes third the differences in reward structures and in the extent of ilms in the different types of library may reflect a difference in the work performed if as kantor  and others suggest ilms develop in situations requiring a high degree of firmor occupation specific knowledge relying heavily on employee discretion and judgment and competing for labor the corollary is that the lack of an ilm may be evidence of an absence of these conditions school libraries apparent lack of ilms may indicate differences in the work performed andor the skills required from those in the other library sectors teaching is often considered a secondary market because it lacks career ladders  p  school libraries may be part of the teaching market this possibility merits further investigation these results do not tell us why or how the sexes differ in their
 the library quarterly assignment to types of libraries however the observed differences are consistent with the distribution of library types on the primarysecondary continuum with fewer women in the more primary like sectors further research is needed on the process by which librarians are initially assigned to a market segment current research indicates that most library school students have already sorted themselves by type of library  what remains to be seen is how this comes about previous research  has refuted the hypothesis that male and female librarians sort themselves by type of library based on their family circumstances and labor force attachment the finding of labor market segmentation within librarianship is also a contribution to segmented labor market research and the debate over industry versus occupational segmentation by finding differences in salaries employee characteristics and labor market functioning consistent with a segmented labor market within an occupation with substantial educational prerequisites this study shows that research at the level of entire occupations may obscure important differences the industryoccupation cell is clearly an appropriate unit of analysis for investigating labor market differences within librarianship not all members of the occupation are governed by the same labor market this needs to be tested in other occupations as well that cross industry boundaries by the nature of the data this study was limited to ala members in public and academic libraries in school libraries it was further limited to women special libraries cross virtually all industry categories and so would be particularly useful for further investigation but because they are so widely distributed they are difficult to study a more detailed analysis of the relationship between school librarianship and teaching would also be useful for a fuller understanding of the library market as a whole it is likely that school librarians are operating in a totally different market the teaching market research is also needed on possible differences in the work performed by librarians in the different sectors and the effects of these differences on earnings and on worker assignment this research has shown that the library labor market is heterogeneous in its salary determination other differences may contribute to the dynamics of the library labor market references  van house nancy a return on the investment in library education library and information science research  january march     van house nancy a salary determination and occupational segregation among librarians library quarterly  april
