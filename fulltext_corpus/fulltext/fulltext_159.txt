Student Concerns in Choice of Library School MARYLOUISE D. MEDER Surveys of library school students at Emporia State University have shown location, cost, accreditation, reputation of the school, familiarity with the parent institution, program content, public relations and publicity, and the availability of a full summer program and off campus courses influenced their choice of library school. A study of library school catalogs and other information pertinent to the nine factors brought out in the surveys showed that the 61 accredited library school programs in the United States offer prospective students much variety in each category. Even in matters of admission standards and program content accredited library school programs show little standardization. Those considering a career in librarianship or an allied field have a wider choice than ever before. SURVEYS of students at the School of Library Science at Em- poria State University have shown their choice of school is based on nine major considerations. The surveys, which were entirely voluntary, were conducted during the fall of 1978 and the summer of 1980. For this group of 57 students convenient location and economic factors far outdistanced any other considerations with location cited by 73.68 percent of the respondents and cost factors by 61.41 percent. Accredita- tion placed third with 22.80 percent noting the importance of American Library Association official recognition. In descending order of fre- quency on the questionnaires were reputation of the school, 19.30 per- cent; familiarity with Emporia State, 14.04 percent; admission standards, Meder is Associate Professor, School of Library Science, Emporia Kansas State University, Emporia, KS 66801. 3
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP 12.28 percent; program content, 5.76 percent; public relations and pub- licity, 5.26 percent; availability of a summer program, 5.26 percent; and off-campus classes, 5.26 percent. Although the student body at Emporia is more homogeneous than that at some institutions, the main factors behind their choice of a library school would be common to others considering entering the profession. Over a four year period the student body at Emporia has shown a high percentage of women, 83.88 percent as compared with 16.62 percent men. The average age for all students of 31.52 reflects the number of women who are entering the profession at midlife. Location and cost are especially important considerations for this group. A high percentage of Emporia students, 64.91 percent hold bac- calaureate degrees from Kansas institutions. During the past four years the states contiguous with Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri, and Oklahoma, provided the most non-Kansas degrees. South Dakota, another plains state, ranked fourth. Foreign students comprised 5.31 percent of the student body during the years surveyed. In each of the years English, elementary education, and history have been the most common undergraduate majors.1 The results of the student study prompted an investigation of material about and catalogs from the 61 accredited library school programs in the United States. Just what do they offer the prospective student? Accreditation is of paramount concern to those seeking professional credentials. Students in the eighties may choose from 61 different institu- tions, an increase of 15 programs or gain of more than 337.3 percent since 1970.2 Also since that time, the Northeast has gained six schools making a total of 18, a 50 percent rise; the Southeast has added five schools raising the regional total to 12; the Midwest has added three new programs to bring the total to 17, a gain of 21.4 percent; the Southwest has added two schools to raise the number to six; and the West has lost one program giving the region eight schools and representing a loss of 1 1 . 1 1 percent. The greatest gain in new library programs, an increase of 71.4 percent has occurred in the Southeast, an area which has been growing in popula- tion, but the Southwest, another area of population increase, and the Northeast, a region which is growing more slowly, each showed percent- age gains of 50 percent in number of accredited programs. In this day of soaring college fees almost every student must rank cost among top priorities when choosing a school. As expected, the cost of library education varies considerably from institution to institution. Moreover, fees fluctuate so much that few generalizations can be made with any degree of certainty. The most important factor in the determination of college fees is 4

JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP whether the institution is publicly or privately supported. Of the 61 accredited programs in the United States all but 17 are part of publicly supported institutions. Fees for residents of states where these institutions are located are far lower than they would be at most private institutions. Only one private university has rates which compare with the average at public universities.3 table 2.

Quarter hours were changed to semester hours with fees raised accordingly. When fees were given by hour, the figure was multiplied by 12, consequently, fees are approximate, c University of Texas has a low base fee to which are added "rather steep" additional fees. A substantial number of fees are added to this, d Brigham Young University, a private institution substantially supported by the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, has reasonable rates for Mormon students and slightly higher fees for non-Mormons. Table 2 shows that tuition fees charged residents of the state range from a high of $2400 to a low of $50. One California institution has no tuition but charges residents another fee. The average tuition charged by all institutions, both public and private ranges from a high of $1,197.25 in the Northeast to a low of $644.00 in the Southeast. The Southwest which has no library schools in private institutions is even lower with a $223.16 8
Student Concerns average. The figure for the Northeast is high because eight of the 18 library schools are in private institutions. For the non-resident the Midwest has the highest average tuition with $1,439.11 followed closely by the Northeast with $1,417.92, and by the West with $ 1 ,303.56. The Southeast offers the lowest average tuition with $1,050.10. Again, the Southwest has the lowest average of all, $685.83, because all library schools are in state universities. The average for the Midwest where only three of the 17 library schools are in private institutions is unusually high because four of the large state universities charge non-residents more than two of the private institu- tions. The four charge anywhere from $700 to $1,000 more than their nearest competitor in the region and only one institution, a school in the Northeast comes close to the high tuition rates demanded by the four. With just a few exceptions public universities offer library school stu- dents the most economical rates. For the resident rates range from a high of $1,260 for 12 hours to a low of $50.00. Average tuition rates range from a high of $705.45 in the Northeast to a low of $223.16 in the Southwest. The Midwest average of $595.78 indicates that prices are more reasonable for residents even at the four universities which charge high fees to outsiders. However, rates at two of the schools are much higher than those at sister institutions. For the non-resident, rates at public institutions range from a high of $2,308 at a Midwestern university to a low of $480. The Midwest also has the highest average tuition of $1316.06; the Southwest with $685.85 has the lowest. One Southeastern university offers graduate non-residents the same rate as residents of the state. At independent and church related institutions tuition rates range from $2,400 to $810. The low figure which compares favorably with fees assessed by public institutions, is possible only because the church which operates the institution lends unusually strong financial support. Average tuition rates at library schools in private institutions range from a high of $2,0 13.33 in the Midwest to a low of $ 1 ,459.67 in the South. Except for the Southwest where all institutions are in state universities all regions offer students wide price ranges. All offer at least one institu- tion where rates are very reasonable though, as shown in Table 2, those in the Northeast and Midwest tend to charge higher rates than their coun- terparts in other sections of the country. To counter the high cost for out of state students a number of institu- tions offer reciprocal tuition arrangements for residents of states which do not have accredited library programs. The WICHE Student Exchange Program assists students from Montana, Nevada, Wyoming, Alaska, New Mexico, Oregon, and Idaho to attend library schools in other western 9
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP universities. Catalogs of the universities of Washington, Hawaii, Denver, and California at Los Angeles mention participation in this program. Another regional program benefits New England students who live in states which do not have a library school in a state-supported institution. The University of Rhode Island offers a reduced fee rate to those who qualify and at Southern Connecticut State College qualified New England students pay in-state tuition. Virginia has an arrangement whereby the state provides funds to cover the difference between in state and out of state tuition up to $ 1 ,200 for its residents. The catalog of the University of Maryland announces this attractive offer and the University of North Carolina also participates in this program. Parent institutions of other library schools have agreements with uni- versities in neighboring states though library school catalogs do not men- tion the fact. Missouri, which has an arrangement with Nebraska, and Minnesota, which has an agreement with universities in North and South Dakota are among this group. Library schools also offer students financial aid ranging from substan- tial government stipends to small school managed scholarships. Of the library schools, 93.44 percent, list their major awards in the American Library Association pamphlet Financial Assistance for Library Education. Those institutions which indicate dollar amounts show ranges from a $200 fellowship to a $10,000 opportunity grant. An Eastern school offers several fellowships of more than $8,000 and at least eight other schools offer some awards of more than $5,000. Other schools may offer equally attractive stipends but no dollar amounts are listed in the pamphlet.4 Library school or college graduate research or teaching assistantships which require between nine and 25 hours of work per week are among the most lucrative of the awards. Of the 29 schools which list numbers of hours at all nine, or 31.03 percent, specify ten hours of work and 1 1, or 37.93 percent, mention 20. The listed amounts of the assistantships for master's candidates range from $446 per semester to $5,523 per year.5 Memorial scholarships with listed stipends range from a low of $200 to a high of $5, 1 68 with the greatest number at $500. The 1 7 fellowships have a range of $286 to $3,500 with the greatest incidence at $2,000 plus tuition, a substantial stipend at a private university.6 Each of the four schools not listed in the A.L.A. publication offers financial aid ranging in amounts from $100 memorial scholarships to university assistantships and fellowships which would be comparable in value to those given by the listed schools. None of the catalogs of the four schools gives amounts for the larger stipends. Loans, grants in aid, or opportunities for part time employment pro- 10
Student Concerns vide additional possibilities for library school students on tight budgets. The H.W. Wilson Company also awards scholarships of $3,000 on a rotating basis to library schools. Each school may determine whether the award is used for one or several scholarships. Opportunities for financial aid, availability of campus housing, the number of additional fees and off-campus course offerings all affect the cost of library education. Length of the program also has a bearing on cost. Six schools have initiated one and a half or two year programs; at least one more will begin a 48 semester hour program in fall 1 98 1 , and still more are adding hours.7 Location of the school also has a bearing on educational expenses. Generally, living costs in large cities are higher than in small. Prices also tend to be higher in the Northeast and lower in the South as Table 3 shows. table 3. Living Costs in Metropolitan Regions of the United States* NORTHEAST NORTH CENTRAL SOUTH WEST + Boston * Chicago - Atlanta * Denver + Buffalo * Cleveland + Honolulu + New York * Detroit - Los Angeles + Philadelphia -I- Milwaukee -I- San Francisco/ - Pittsburgh + Minneapolis/ Oakland -I- Washington St. Paul * Seattle + Costs substantially higher than average * Costs about average - Costs lower than average a "Living Costs Across the U.S." U.S. News & World Report, 12 May 1980, p. 10. Most library school catalogs give some indication of costs accompanied by a warning that quoted prices are subject to change. Methods of record- ing fees and expenses show a considerable amount of originality. Some catalogs state cost per credit hour, others list fees for the entire quarter or semester; some combine all fees in a single figure, others list each one separately. Fourteen library school catalogs include no fee information; anticipated costs are listed in other materials sent to prospective students. Some indication of fees should be given in library school publications even when appropriate figures must be printed on inserts. Having all pertinent information stated simply and in one place is helpful to the catalog user. Location is another concern of students. Those who must commute or care for families and others for economic reasons wish to remain in their home state or area. For more mobile students size of community is sometimes a consideration. Some prefer a small city where it is easy to get 11
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP from place to place and where urban ills are present to a lesser degree; others prefer a large city where there are more cultural advantages, better transportation facilities, and greater opportunities for employment. Library schools can be found in large cities, small cities, and those in between as may be seen in Table 1 . Individuals wanting a school in a large urban center have a choice of four institutions in New York, two in Chicago, and two in Los Angeles. Small town enthusiasts will find schools in Kingston, Rhode Island; Geneseo, New York; Clarion, Pennsylvania; or Emporia, Kansas. Seekers of a city of medium size may choose prog- rams at universities in Baton Rouge, Syracuse, Knoxville, or New Haven. There are many others in each category. Students hoping for the best of two worlds, a small community near a large city, will find library schools in Greenvale, New York; Dentón, Texas; or College Park, Maryland. Some library schools are in glamour locations close to mountain ski trails or ocean surfing. Programs at Denver, Hawaii, and at the Florida schools are well situated for the sports enthusiast. Warm climates as well as cool, dry as well as humid, high altitudes as well as sea level locations are available to individuals in search of a library school. Table 1 shows 25 or 40.98 percent of library schools are located in cities with populations between 100,000 and 500,000. Nine schools are found in cities of over one million inhabitants and six are situated in communities with fewer than 25,000 inhabitants. Medium sized cities with populations between 25,000 and 99,000 are headquarters for a number of large universities with library programs. The universities of Iowa, Missouri, Indiana, Illinois, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Maryland are among these. In all, 16 schools are located in cities in this size range. Prospective library school students are fortunate in the wide variety of locations available to them. They may choose to live in cities ranging in size from New York, the nation's largest metropolis, to Greenvale, New York, a town whose inhabitants number just over 1,000. They may choose a campus on a beautiful lake, one with a view of the Rocky Mountains, one on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, one in lush blue grass country, or one amid the forests of the Allegheny Mountains. Equally broad is the range in size of parent institutions of library schools. Large universities with their vast human and material resources, their splendid research facilities, and their excellent lecture and cultural series attract some students. Others feel more at home in the more intimate surroundings of a small school where they can be a part of the entire campus community. Parent institutions of library schools run the gamut from the University 12

Table 4 shows that 31 library schools or 50.82 percent are in large universities with more than 20,000 students, 1 3 or 2 1 .3 1 percent are in medium sized institutions with student bodies numbering between 10,000 and 19,999 and 17 or 27.87 percent are in small institutions which have fewer than 10,000 students. Of schools in the East, five or 27.78 percent are in universities with more than 20,000 students, seven or 38.89 percent are in middle sized institutions, and six or 33.33 percent are in small institutions. In the Southeast five or 41.67 percent are in large institutions, two or 16.67 percent are in middle-sized universities, and five or 41.67 percent are in small schools. In the Midwest, 11 or 64.71 percent are in large universities, 11.76 percent are in middle-sized institutions and four or 23.53 percent are in small schools. The Southwest has three schools or 50 percent in large universities, two or 33.33 percent in middle-sized, and one or 16.67 percent in a small institution. Seven or 87.5 percent of the western schools are in large universities, and the other one of the region is in a small institution. Table 4 shows that 44 or 72.13 percent of accredited library school 13
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP programs of the United States are divisions of publicly supported institu- tions. Twenty-nine or 65.91 percent are in universities with more than 20,000 students, nine or 20.45 percent are in institutions in the middle range, and six or 13.64 percent are in small institutions with fewer than 10,000 students. For the student with a limited budget who prefers a small campus the choice is more limited; however, all regions, except the West, have at least one small publicly supported institution. Of the 61 accredited library programs in the United States, 17 are affiliated with privately controlled institutions. Three are connected with Catholic colleges or universities and one with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Table 4 shows that non-publicly supported institutions tend to be small. Only two or 11.76 percent are in universities with more than 20,000 students, four or 23.53 percent, are in institutions with 10,000 to 14,999 students, but eleven or 64.71 percent are in small colleges. The three smallest library schools, Atlanta University, Rosary College, and Simmons College are all non-publicly supported institutions. Students for whom size of institution is important have a wide choice. In every region of the country library schools may be found in institutions of every size range. Admission standards concern almost every library school applicant particularly those whose credentials fall below par. Such persons want to know how strict schools are in enforcing stated standards and also whether there is provision for probationary admission. Library school catalogs show no uniformity whatsoever in stated admis- sion standards although all but one require a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution and all require the applicant to submit several pieces of information for judgment.8 Stated grade point averages range from a high of 3.2 to a low of 2.5. Of schools which provide a GPA score, 72 percent require a 3.0 or B average, eight percent demand 2.75, and 14 percent settle for 2.5. Only one school asks a 3.2 GPA of applicants for master's degrees. The GPA may be based on the entire undergraduate record, the last 60 hours of undergraduate work, or the last 60 hours of schooling, undergraduate or graduate. Information in 37 catalogs shows schools will accept a lower GPA provided the candidate submits high scores for either the Graduate Rec- ord Examination or the Miller Analogies Test, presents glowing letters of recommendation, has had successful professional experience, or pos- sesses other attributes which indicate success as a librarian. Thirty-one library schools require scores from the Graduate Record Examination; one requires the Miller Analogies Test; four others accept 14
Student Concerns scores from either GRE or MAT. In all 59.02 percent of the library schools require submission of scores from a standardized test; 40.98 percent do not require a test having national norms. Thirteen schools requiring the GRE set a minimum acceptable score of 1000 on aptitude sections, two set the lower limit of 900, and one settles for 825. However, 1 5 schools requiring the GRE or MAT fail to mention a specific score or specify only "satisfactory performance." One catalog mentions achievement at the 50th percentile in at least one part of the test. In ten schools only students whose GPA falls below stated standards must take the test. Two exempt applicants who hold advanced degrees. The catalog survey showed considerable reluctance among library schools to be held to a stated score on the GRE. Among other stated admission requirements, 41 or 67.21 percent of the accredited library school programs in the United States ask applicants to furnish letters of recommendation. The usual number is three. Twenty-five or 40.98 percent mention the desirability of a personal interview with the director, a faculty member, or an authorized represen- tative. Seven schools offer applicants opportunity for an interview al- though it is not a general requirement; nine indicate an interview may be necessary in some cases. Thirty-nine, or 63.93 percent, of the schools indicate the need for a broad general education. Anywhere from 60 to 75 percent of an appli- cant's undergraduate work should be in sciences, social sciences, and humanities. Ten schools warn against an undue proportion of work in education, library science, home economics, art, music or other profes- sionally oriented studies. An applicant's potential for success in the library profession is often mentioned in admission standards. In some cases this factor is judged at the interview or by means of the letters of reference but in others the applicant must supply a written statement covering reasons for pursuing graduate studies in librarianship and indicating professional goals. Six- teen schools require a statement of career objectives separate from similar information which may appear on the application. Foreign language competency, something which once appeared in admission requirements of almost every library school, still is considered important by 37.70 percent of the accredited programs. Twelve, or 19.67 percent require reading knowledge of one modern foreign language and ten, or 16.39 percent strongly recommend that those going into academic or research work have foreign language skills. Instead of, or in addition to, knowledge of a foreign language six schools require competencies in a computer language and/or in statistics. One school accepts knowledge of Braille or competence with a manual 15
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP language as fulfillment of its language requirements. One school requires an administration course and two more consider management courses desirable. Tightening of the job market and declining enrollments at some institu- tions have affected admission standards in certain cases. Ten of the larger schools place a quota on their entering classes. At such institutions the applicant whose credentials are below par has less chance of gaining admittance but even in these institutions there is an "escape clause" which may make the difference for some determined applicant. Necessity of meeting quotas for minority groups is another factor which may affect enforcement of stated admission regulations. Much has ap- peared in the literature concerning the cultural bias built into most stan- dardized aptitude tests as well as into our entire educational system. Special knowledge of computer languages, unusually successful library experience, a degree in a scientific field, or outstanding leadership qual- ities will sometimes make a difference between success and failure in gaining acceptance to library school when an applicant's test scores or scholastic record are low. Admission officers in most schools are willing to judge an individual on his or her own merits. A sizable group of students at Emporia learn about the library school while they are undergraduates at the university. Many enter library school immediately after graduation; others, especially those whose under- graduate majors are in education, return to Emporia after they have taught for several years. Some undergraduates choose to come to Em- poria State University because of its library school. Although the influence of the familiar setting may be greater in some schools than in others, the desire to pursue graduate studies at one's alma mater is common to some students at all library schools. The security offered by a familiar campus appeals to some students. They have friends there, have become acquainted with the university and the community, and have learned what to expect from the institution. Having a library school on the same campus where the student has spent his undergraduate years makes for a greater possibility of his choosing librarianship as a career. The visibility of the school and its students in the total academic program is important in attracting students. There is the possibility of meeting faculty and students of the library school, attending special functions at the school, and learning about its program from first hand experience. Reputation of the school, another concern brought out in the Emporia study, is difficult to assess. Rankings of professional schools appear periodically in the literature and are eagerly checked by personnel in the listed schools, alumni, and by students considering a professional career. 16
Student Concerns Naturally, a student wishes to graduate from a prestige institution for he believes that such a degree will mean more in his subsequent career than a sheepskin from a less highly rated university. In spite of numerous attempts, no one has yet devised a fool proof system for determining excellence. And even a top school will produce its share of graduates who for one reason or another founder on the ladder of success. Conversely, a school whose reputation is less bright can pro- duce leaders in the field. Of the studies of library school rankings which have been made during the seventies one by the Carpenters9 and two by the Blau/Margulies10 n team probably have had the greatest impact. In each of the three studies results showed the top library schools to be Chicago, Columbia, Illinois, and Michigan with Rutgers and the University of California at Berkeley appearing among the top five in two studies and Case Western Reserve University in one. In almost every case these schools were pioneers in library education. The seven wer^ among the first to award doctorates in library science and have produced a high percentage of the doctorates. A majority of those polled in the surveys held the doctorate and would be likely to vote for schools with which they were familiar. Furthermore, the library schools with top rankings are all a part of large universities which support a number of top flight professional schools. They can attract leaders in the library field. There has been considerable shifting in the upper eschelons of library education over the past few years. Twenty-three schools now offer the doctorate, an increase of six since 1970. Many of the individuals who helped build the reputation of one of the elite schools have retired or died. Some of the newer programs now produce a greater number of the doctorates and have succeeded in attracting some of today's library lead- ers which means the next study may show a different alignment at the top. Very few library schools in less prestigious institutions can aspire to be included in lists of the best schools yet each has potential for acquiring a good regional reputation. Some schools have built a reputation around special programs which emphasize the training of information specialists, computer program- mers, archivists, school media specialists, or urban librarians. Other schools are noted for good all round programs which prepare students to perform well in a variety of library positions. A school's reputation is based on the effectiveness of its graduates in their first professional positions. It is also based on the willingness of its alumni to recommend the program to others. At Emporia, studies have 17
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP demonstrated that more students learn of the school from alumni than from any other source. Program content concerned students in the Emporia study. Individuals who have made a decision regarding the type of work they wish to pursue have special interest in the matter. Location, cost, reputation, and other factors take lower priorities for the person who has a definite career goal in mind. A perusal of the catalogs of the accredited programs shows a great variety in offerings. All schools give at least one type of master's degree though they call it by many different names as Table 5 shows. The most common degree is the Master of Library Science given by 27 schools, next is the Master of Arts awarded by 1 1 schools, and in third pace is the Master of Science in Library Science given by ten schools. Eleven schools offer a choice in master's programs. Specialties of some schools are reflected in the titles of their degrees. Among these are Master of Law Librarianship, Master of Science in Instructional Technology, and Master of Science in Library Media. Catalogs of 45 schools describe certification programs for students interested in school librarianship or media specializations. Many provide for those seeking certification but not degrees. table 5. Types of Degrees Offered Fifth Y ear Library Science Students by Accredited Libran School Programs in the United States 27 Master of Library Science 10 Master of Arts 1 1 Master of Science in Library Science 5 Master of Science 4 Master of t Arts in Library Science 3 Master of Librarianship 2 Master of Law Librarianship 2 Master of Library Service 1 Master of Library Administration 1 Master of Library Studies 1 Master of Science in Information Science 1 Master of Science in Instructional Technology 1 Master of Science in Librarianship 1 Master of Science in Library and Information Science 1 Master of Science in Library Media 1 Master of Science in Library Service 1 Master of Education There is some variance between names of degrees as stated in school catalogs and information on "Graduate Library School Programs Accredited by the American Library Association Under Standards for Accreditation, March, 1980." There is agreement on the Master of Library Science degree and usually in order of frequency of appearanced degrees. In most cases the differences concern the extension of names of certain degrees such as Master of Science in Library and Information Science instead of Master of Science. 18
Student Concerns Almost all schools provide courses for individuals interested in the traditional specialties of public, academic, or special librarianship. Thirty announce public library specialties, 28 academic, and 23 pro- grams for special librarianship on a general level. Others emphasize information science, library administration, rare book, art, map, or medical librarianship. The number of possibilities seems endless. One school offers its students 12 different tracks. In a recent study of accredited and non-accredited M.L.S. programs in the United States and Canada, Kay Murray found that joint degree programs are popular. She cites 25 different programs ranging from Library Science and Communications to Library Science and Operations Research. Her study showed the library degree most frequently coupled with education, history, or law.12 The Lemke study of alternative specialties in library education showed library schools were most likely to offer specialty courses in medicine, law, archives, or rare books.13 Of the more unusual combinations of programs are those which offer specialties in gerontology, drug information, or bilingual, bicultural studies. Joint degree programs are especially attractive because they pro- vide the advantage of a specialty as well as the added inducement of a shorter program than the usual 60 or more semester hours required for two degrees. Furthermore, the joint degree gives students a better chance to win in the fierce competition in today's marketplace. Because of the lack of employment opportunities and increased num- bers of college graduates with advanced degrees in subject or professional fields, many library schools have been able to attract individuals with unusually impressive credentials. Young graduates who have only the baccalaureate and library degrees find it difficult to compete with these highly qualified candidates. The joint degree program affords them a chance to bring their credentials more nearly in line with qualifications presented by other candidates for positions. The school offering a single degree program with nojoint degree plans, specializations, advanced certificate, or doctoral studies is now the excep- tion as Table 1 points out. A study of the catalogs reveals only nine schools limit their efforts to a master's degree in library science and one of these offers a single specialization in school library media. Some of the others may have experimental programs too new to show in catalogs. Programs outlined in library school catalogs reflect just one of many changes which have occurred in librarianship over a relatively short span of years. The coming of age of the computer shows up in names of degrees like Master of Science in Information Science and in specialties such as industrial engineering and operations research, computer and 19
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP information science, information systems, and information science and library automation. Some schools, reflecting the need to expand beyond the traditional library field, emphasize careers in non-library information related positions. New developments in the library field have also had an effect on the growth in the number of sixth-year programs leading to either certificate or degree. Librarians who wish to keep up to date in their rapidly chang- ing profession can return to library school, participate in workshops or take off-campus courses for training in areas not touched when some of them graduated. The most recent information shows that 36 of the accredited schools offer some sort of sixth-year program.14 The first school with a single purpose program which leads to a Master of Science in Library Media has been accredited within the past decade. Another school offers a sixth-year program in school library media, others provide media specialties, and almost all cover the area with several courses. Although a majority, 39 or 63.93 percent, of the accredited schools still consider a balanced liberal arts background important, they also seek out individuals qualified in the sciences, one area where placement oppor- tunities remain rosy. Students with backgrounds in business suddenly are in demand for their training in management, accounting, data process- ing, and interpersonal relations prove invaluable to library adminis- trators. Undergraduate majors in computer programming or mathemat- ics provide a good foundation for advanced studies in computer technol- ogy and information science. Students with majors in sociology or public welfare can use their training as foundation for urban studies programs and emerge from library school with a good understanding of the special information needs of the inner city. Although library school curricula reflect many specialties, they also provide training for the generalist. Coming decades promise a brighter future for a different type of generalist, one who is well versed in the vast information spectrum of the automated library.15 A student in search of a library school will have little difficulty finding a program to suit specific needs. There are all kinds of possibilities and the number is growing each year. As positions in traditional library settings become tighter, curricula will reflect training for positions in allied fields. To survive library schools must search for other markets for their graduates. As Robert S. Taylor has pointed out, the information industry is booming. Library school graduates can fill positions as abstractors, index creators, software producers, information specialists in companies, editors, or systems specialists.16 The availability of off-campus classes appealed to some students in the 20
Student Concerns survey. Information in 17, or 27.87 percent, of the library school catalogs indicated that some courses were offered off-campus and 12 or 19.67 percent mentioned late afternoon, evening, or weekend classes to help the part-time student complete requirements for the master's degree. Very likely some schools which offer these possibilities do not include them in their catalogs. Only one school indicated the entire program could be obtained at one of its satellite centers. Another factor influencing choice of school which showed up in the Emporia survey related to the possibility for completing the entire library school program in summers only. Such program flexibility is of vital concern to Kansas school librarians who often live too far from Emporia to come for late afternoon or evening classes or are not near a center where off-campus courses are available. Forty-five or 73.77 percent of the library schools make it possible for students to complete their programs in summers only though several noted such a plan is not recommended. All schools in the Southwest, 94. 1 2 percent of those in the Midwest, and 83.33 percent of those in the southeast provide full summer programs. However, in the Northeast 55.56 percent allow students to complete programs through summer work only and in the West only 37.5 percent give students this opportun- ity. For part time students the number of years allowed them to work on the program is important. Of the catalogs which gave this information 35.56 percent had a five year limit and the same percentage allowed six years. Time limitations for completion of the degree ranged from three to eight years. A final factor in the choice of a library school for some respondents in the Emporia survey was publicity. Some found the catalog and other publications produced by the school appealing. A study of the catalogs of the 61 accredited programs shows a variety of formats. They range from a one sheet foldover offering four pages of information to thick, picture-filled catalogs providing many pages of data for prospective librarians. Some catalogs have colorful covers with bright, eye-catching abstractions; others use photographs of the school or some trademark of the librarian to good advantage; some, reflecting budgetary restrictions more than lack of imagination, simply state the facts with no recourse to the diversions afforded by flashy format. Inside, the larger catalogs picture faculty members at work, show smil- ing students using computer terminals, provide photos of scenic spots on campus, and supply maps of the university and surrounding region. Some depict students in the more traditional roles of reading books or checking the card catalog. Others depend on spots of color and good 21
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP design to advertise their programs. A few use words alone to sell their schools to prospective students. Although information is of prime concern to library school applicants, information in appealing dress has greater impact. The catalog need not be large and filled with extraneous material but for this visually oriented generation a few spots of color and several well chosen photographs will make the product more attractive to its audience. Even more important is clear, simple, up to date information. For larger catalogs an index is a necessity. Features of vital concern - fees, admission standards, degree requirements, opportunities for financial aid, length of program - should stand out. Too many pictures, too few headlines, lack of an index, emphasis on nonessentials, or lack of complete information can obscure the main purpose of the catalog - to sell a program to a prospective student. The importance of responding immediately to inquiries about the program and in continuing communication following the applicant's ini- tial request was also brought out in the Emporia survey. Students are more likely to be impressed by a school which cares enough about them to respond immediately to their inquiries. In a small school the extra time and attention devoted to correspondence alone may make the difference between whether the applicant enrolls in that institution or seeks another. For the Emporia student cost and location are the most important considerations. The study of library schools in the United States shows almost 64 percent of the schools offer reasonable tuition rates. However, 19 schools have tuition fees of more than $1,000 for residents of the state and 21 charge non-residents more than $1,500 per semester. Of the 22 different institutions in the group six are publicly supported and three of the six charge residents as well as non-residents high fees. When there are so many less expensive programs in the country how can higher priced programs exist and prosper? The one factor common to 90.9 1 percent of the more expensive schools is location in or near a city of more than 400,000. The other two schools are a part of state universities with more than 35,000 students. Of the 22 institutions 12, or 54.55 percent, are part of institutions having student bodies numbering 1 0,000 or more. Being in a location with great potential student supply helps library schools and also the students who may be able to commute thereby saving large expenditures for living accommoda- tions. Multiplicity of programs offered are also a characteristic of the group. Thirteen or 59.09 percent offer the doctorate, 19 or 86.36 percent offer a sixth-year program, 15 or 68.18 percent provide one or more special 22
Student Concerns programs. Special programs are a drawing card for library school stu- dents. Prestige is another factor which must be considered. Seven or 31.81 percent of the schools are included in either the Blau/Margulies or Car- penter assessments of library schools. All but one appear in both studies. If at all possible students seek out an institution which is well-known and highly-respected. The survey of library school catalogs shows the prospective student has infinite variety with respect to each item mentioned in the Emporia survey. Prospective students may choose from public institutions where costs are reasonable to private universities with high tuition fees. They may attend library school in a large metropolitan center or in a small, rural setting; they may choose a school with stiff admission requirements or one which is more lenient in screening applicants. They may pick a school which has built a fine reputation over a long period of years or a newer program noted for an innovative approach or they may opt to remain at their undergraduate alma mater for advanced training. Opportunities for specialization are myriad. Summer and off-campus offerings as well as weekend, late afternoon, and evening programs make it possible for those who work to take advantage of library school programs. Library schools offer opportunities for positions in allied fields as well as in libraries. And students in search of a library school may pick their institution from catalogs which vary from glossy to plain, from fat to thin, from large to small. Never before have library school applicants enjoyed such a wide range of choice. References and Notes 1.
