THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY Volume 59 JANUARY 1989 Number 1 HISTORIC CATALOGING COSTS, ISSUES, AND TRENDS George Harris' The length of LC cataloging cards in number of characters increased 24.5 percent between 1956 and 1981, the number of entries 130.2 percent, the number of fields 96.9 percent, and the number of subject heading subdivisions 156.2 percent. There is a trend toward longer and more complex cataloging copy and a small countertrend toward less than AACR2 cataloging. Most aca- demic libraries, 69.2 percent, are unable to state what their cataloging costs are. Since 1876 the wholesale commodity price index has increased 729 percent, the price of gold (another measure of inflation) 1,590 percent, and the cost of cataloging for large libraries from $0.40 per volume to $17.17 per volume, or 4,292 percent. Since 1896 librarians' annual salaries have increased from $607 to $28,533 or 4,700 percent. Cataloging costs have increased faster than the rate of inflation, but more slowly than the rate of salary increases. Keyes Metcalf tells the story of how, after the British burned the Capitol, including the Library of Congress, in 1812, Thomas Jefferson sold his 6,000-volume library to Congress for $23,000. After the books were cataloged, Congress complained about the high cost of cataloging, which was a total of $1,369.50, or $0.22 per volume [1]. This incident yielded one of the earliest figures on cataloging costs in this country and proba- bly the first recorded protest over the high cost of cataloging. Was this complaint justified? Have cataloging costs become any cheaper? This essay tries to answer these questions. I held certain incompletely substantiated beliefs before I embarked on the research for this study. One was the possibility that cataloging is growing longer and more complex than it has been in the past and, 1. University Libraries, University of Missouri at Columbia, Columbia, Missouri 65201.

2 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY therefore, more expensive, since original cataloging may take longer to perform. I suspected that there might be a countertrend toward incom- plete cataloging because there is growing evidence of it in the OCLC database. I thought it might be possible that the recession of 1981-82- which still lingers in the oil-producing states, some of the Great Plains farm states, and in parts of the Rust Belt-had caused libraries to retrench by replacing professionals with cheaper labor and by using incomplete cataloging. I suspected that the advent of OCLC and the use of LC cataloging copy might have reduced the cost of cataloging. To test the validity of these assumptions, I did three things: (1) conducted a comparative sampling of LC copy in the National Union Catalog Pre-56 Imprints and the National Union Catalog, 1982 and then compared the two samplings on the basis of length and complexity of LC cataloging copy, (2) conducted a mail survey in the form of a questionnaire to 179 of the largest academic libraries in the country and tabulated the results, and (3) conducted research on historical cataloging costs and historic salary figures appearing in the professional literature since 1876 and com- pared them with the rate of inflation since that time until the present (1986). Some of these assumptions turned out to be valid, and some turned out to be false. I. Length and Complexity of Catalog Copy In order to determine whether cataloging copy is growing progressively longer and more complex, two samplings were taken, one from the National Union Catalog Pre-56 Imprints and the other from the National Union Catalog, 1982, which contains examples of cataloging done in 1981. The latter is the last annual set of NUC compiled in print form. The subsequent volumes of NUC are in microfiche form and are much too difficult to work with for sampling purposes. For the 1982 sampling, the last volume of a letter sequence was selected and the cataloging copy was counted going from back to front of each letter sequence in order to avoid the initialisms which are found in front of each letter sequence, where the catalog cards are not really typical of most cataloging. The one hundredth, two hundredth, three hundredth, and four hundredth ex- amples of LC monographic cataloging were counted and photocopied. Only Library of Congress monographic cataloging copy was counted. No NUC copy or Library of Congress copy for periodicals was selected. There were not one hundred examples of LC copy in the letter X volume for 1982, and no samples were selected. There were only enough examples for the three hundredth sample to be counted for the letter Q sequence. There were, then, four samples for each letter of the alphabet, except three samples for the letter Q and none at all for
HISTORIC CATALOGING COSTS 3 the letter X, making a total of ninety-nine samples in all taken from the NUC 1982. To make the samplings parallel, only ninety-nine samples of catalog cards were taken from the National Union Catalog Pre-56 Imprints, and the counting backward was done from the third from the last volume in- stead of the last volume, as was done for the NUC 1982. Again only LC catalog copy was selected. Each example had either an LC card number in the lower-right-hand corner or "Library of Congress" printed in the lower-left-hand corner. No examples with cropped bottoms were used. Again all of the examples were photocopied. After the samples were copied from the NUC 1982, they were searched in the OCLC database. Of the ninety-nine samples from NUC 1982, thirteen were not in the OCLC database. These thirteen samples were in Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Hebrew, and Greek and were not transliterated into the Latin alphabet as LC usually does now for Cyrillic cataloging. For the samples taken from the NUC 1982 and searched for machine-readable catalog- ing copy in the OCLC database, certain characters (letters and numerals) were counted in measuring record length that were not counted for the samples in the Pre-56 Imprints. These characters are the information input into a machine-readable workform, for example, "eng" in the language fixed field. It is legitimate to count this information and to compare LC cataloging in machine-readable form with cataloging done in the past not in this form because the new way represents an additional burden imposed on contemporary catalogers that catalogers twenty-five years ago did not have to bear. However, characters in the fixed fields or in the variable fields that are printed on every standardized workform and require no input by a cataloger were not counted. Examples of these characters are: "Type," "Repr," "Indx," in the fixed fields and "020" in the variable fields. To measure the length of cataloging copy, all of the characters and all of the punctuation except diacritical marks were counted on each catalog card or printout, the total was recorded, and the average number of charac- ters for all ninety-nine cards was calculated. This information is found in table 1. Complexity in cataloging may be defined as the number of entries and fields on a catalog card together with the information, either in the body of the card or the note area, used to justify making these entries. The complexity of cataloging copy was measured by counting the following characteristics of complexity: the number of entries to LC catalog cards in both the Pre-56 Imprints and the NUC 1982, the number of author- type entries (personal author, corporate author, editors, translators, illustrators), the number of title-type entries (parallel title, uniform title, title traced differently), the number of series entries, the number of subject entries, the number of subject heading subdivisions, and the

The total was calculated and the average was found for each of these characteristics for both the Pre-56 Imprints and the 1982 NUC. These two sets of averages are found in table 1. The results of the comparison show that the length of LC cataloging copy has increased by one-fourth between 1956 and 1982. Cataloging complexity measured by the number of entries has increased 130 per- cent, by the number of fields, 96.6 percent. Author entries have in- creased the least, only 19.6 percent, and subject heading subdivisions have increased the most, 156.2 percent. An example of what is meant by subject heading subdivisions is illustrated by the following two instances, the first of which has no subdivisions and the second of which has two subdivisions. Neither example was found in either of the two samplings, but they illustrate how it is necessary to add subdivisions onto a main heading in order to differentiate among a large collection of books on one topic. Austen, Jane, 1775-1817. Austen, Jane, 1775-1817-Criticism and interpretation- Addresses, essays, lectures. Cataloging copy has definitely become both much longer and much more complex. There are two reasons for this increase. First, there are many more books in libraries to differentiate. The second reason is that library material itself is becoming more voluminous and more complex. One example of this increase in size and complexity of library materials is the census publications of the U.S. Bureau of the Census. The first census in 1790 had only one section, population, and contained only twelve volumes, one for the whole country and the others for the states. By contrast, the census for 1900 had four sections: population, agricul-
HISTORIC CATALOGING COSTS 5 ture, manufactures, and mines and quarries. By 1970, the census for population alone had grown to 105 volumes [2]. There is a trend toward greater volume and complexity in materials libraries acquire, and the cataloging of this material reflects this trend: the cataloging becomes longer and more complex also. II. Cataloging Cost Questionnaire In order to determine what present-day cataloging costs are, whether the depression of 1981-82 has caused libraries to try to cut costs, and how important libraries consider cataloging costs, a cataloging-cost ques- tionnaire was composed and sent to 179 of the largest academic libraries in the United States. Of these 179 libraries, 117 replied, for a response rate of 65 percent. A copy of the questionnaire appears in Appendix A, and a list of the responding libraries appears in Appendix B. The questions and their answers are presented in table 2. What is surprising about the answers to question 2 is the large number of libraries still using only a card catalog. The replies to question 3 indicate that the suspicion that the recession of 1981-82 had caused libraries to worry about cataloging costs is largely unfounded. The most remarkable finding from the answers to question 4 is that most academic libraries are unable or unwilling to state their cataloging costs. Only a minority have either an exact or a rough idea of costs. Three libraries sent in information that was not usable. Two sent in their cataloging costs minus salary and wages for personnel, and one sent in its total cataloging costs for both monographs and serials but not divided by either the number of volumes or the number of titles. These three replies were not counted. Thirty-four libraries answered this question in a variety of ways. For some the answer was given in cost per volume and for others in a cost per title. Some gave a figure for copy cataloging and another for original cataloging. For these libraries, the cost for copy cataloging was used in finding the average cost of the thirty-four librar- ies. Other libraries gave a range of figures, for example, $15-$20 per volume, and for these libraries, the lower figure was used. Some libraries gave one figure for both monographs and serials. For libraries that lumped cataloging costs for both monographs and serials into one fig- ure, the highest figure was $53.00 and the lowest was $14.67. For libraries giving separate figures for monographs, the range was from $32.00 for original cataloging at one university to a low of $6.43 for copy cataloging at another. The average cost of cataloging is given for thirty-four cases, but only seven libraries gave separate figures for serials cataloging cost. Because this number is so low no average will be given. A warning must be given about the above figures. The phrase

For this reason the above figures for monographic costs are at best only a conservative rough estimate of current academic library cataloging costs, even though they look precise. The answers total more than the number of libraries responding because some libraries checked more than one method of cutting costs. Question 5 was phrased so that the replies indicated that the recession of 1981-82 was the cause of the cost cutting. But some libraries may have done these things prior to the recession. One library replied that it had tried these methods of cost cutting for a decade and that the recession was not responsible. This may also be true for some of the other libraries counted in the above responses. Although the Library of Congress was not polled by the cataloging cost questionnaire, it has announced through OCLC that it, too, is doing minimal-level cataloging of books whose research value is considered low [3]. There is, then, a slight trend toward incomplete cataloging. For question 7, the three columns do not have the same number of replies because some libraries indicated a first choice only and left the second and third choices blank. Most libraries profess that quality is the most important consideration in their cataloging, and many may have
8 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY answered in this way because they felt that quality was the "correct" answer, but a surprising number value quantity highly. Some of the results of the cataloging cost questionnaire were to be expected and some were surprising. Most academic libraries use OCLC, but several use more than one bibliographic utility. A surprisingly large number of colleges and universities (37.7 percent) still use only a card catalog for their public catalog, and a large number use both cards and on-line (36.8 percent). Cataloging costs are of only moderate concern to most academic libraries (59.8 percent), and this was a surprise. Most academic libraries (69.2 percent) were not able or were unwilling to report what their cataloging costs are. The average cataloging cost in 1985-86 for monographs, in academic libraries that know their catalog- ing costs, is $17.17 (per volume in most cases), but this figure is only a conservative rough estimate. Very few libraries are doing anything to control costs. Only 7.7 percent are engaged in cooperative cataloging. The most used method to control costs is to use cheaper labor, but only 35 percent of libraries are doing this. Most libraries deny trying to phase out professionals. There is a small trend (13.7 percent) toward libraries' doing less than AACR2 cataloging, but the Library of Congress admits that it, too, is going to do this for certain books. Most libraries polled value quality first in cataloging, but 63 percent value quantity as either first or second in importance. I1I. Historic Cataloging Costs The library profession organized itself in 1876 with the establishment of the American Library Association and the advent of Libraiy Journal, its first professional journal. The very first volume of LibraryJournaltcarries an article by Charles A. Cutter which defends the need for a library catalog as opposed to bibliographies listing books that a library may not have. Cutter gives cataloging costs for an unnamed large library as $0.40 per volume and for an unnamed small public library as $0.16 per volume. He says that at most cataloging would cost $0.50 to make and $0.30 more to print [4]. At this time library catalogs were printed in book form and were not yet in card catalog form. In addition to being the first American article on cataloging costs, this article is important for being the first to notice that cataloging costs are greater for large librar- ies than for small ones and that the difference in cataloging costs varies enormously, in this case by 250 percent, from one library to another. Nine years later, in 1885, another article on cataloging costs appeared in Libra?y Journal. The author, James L. Whitney, director of the Boston Public Library, reports the cost of cataloging and classification of books at his library at $0.3575 per volume. When he wrote his article, printed
HISTORIC CATALOGING COSTS 9 book catalogs were being replaced by card catalogs. In addition to the figures for the Boston Public, Whitney mentions cataloging cost figures for three unnamed libraries, and they are, respectively, $0.16, $0.12, and $0.13 per volume. The first figure is for a printed book catalog, and the last two are for manuscript card catalogs. The Boston Public itself was using two different types of catalogs at the time: a printed book catalog for English fiction, which was already in its seventh edition, and a card catalog for books in the Bates Hall collection [5]. William Warner Bishop, of the Princeton University Library, gives no statistics for the Princeton library in 1905 but does cite specific costs at the John Crerar Library as reported by its librarian: $0.45 for the labor costs of cataloging plus an additional $0.15 for printing the catalogs, for a total cost of $0.60. He does not say whether this cost is a per-title cost or a per-volume cost. Bishop is also the first librarian to state in print that comparative cataloging cost studies are unsatisfactory. He says that the cost studies have little value because there are too many varying pro- cesses and practices involved in different libraries for the comparative cost studies to measure the same thing [6]. Despite Bishop's complaints about the validity of comparative catalog- ing costs surveys, the American Library Association Committee on Cost of Cataloging sponsored a cataloging test in 1913 and 1914. It sent out questionnaires to thirty-eight libraries; only eighteen libraries, however, took part. These libraries were to take 100 titles of average difficulty and to compute the cost of cataloging, classification, shelf listing, and prepa- ration of cards, based on the salaries of the people involved. The pur- pose of the test was to find a cost, for each of four different types of libraries, that was to be both empirical and prescriptive for costs at other libraries. The results of the test were as follows: three large libraries reported average cataloging costs of $0.642; four university librar- ies reported average cataloging costs of $0.16; seven large public li- braries reported average cataloging costs of $0.252; and four small libraries reported cataloging costs of $0. 10 1. The university figures were too low to be credible even at the time they were reported. This unlikely average was caused by the figures reported by Columbia and Yale. Columbia reported a figure of $0.095 per title and Yale a cost of $0.1733 per title [7]. Both libraries were called upon to explain their unbelievable costs. Harriet B. Prescott spoke on behalf of Columbia. She admitted that Columbia's average cost of cataloging was $0.90 per title, not $0.095, but she did not explain how she arrived at the nine-and-a-half- cent figure she reported for the test. Sara G. Hyde said on behalf of Yale that they turned the test into a race, that they counted only time spent at desk and typewriter, not time spent looking things up, that the books were easier than the usual ones, that 24 percent of the books they did for the test were unclassed and others required only a single letter for
10 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY classification. She admitted that Yale's cost per title in 1915-16 was really $0.5012, not $0.1733 as reported on the test. The cataloging test was not a success, then, because some of the participants misunderstood the purpose of the test and because there was no agreement on stan- dards and terminology [8]. Illinois collected cataloging statistics for the years 1922-25 and cal- culated that its cataloging costs were $0.776 per volume during this period [9]. The next statistics available for academic libraries are pro- vided by McCrum, who gives the figures for Grinnell, Iowa State, and California as being, respectively: $0.675, $0.677, and $0.726 in 1929 [10]. During the 1920s and 1930s, the idea that cataloging costs could include other things besides salaries and wages of the catalogers ap- peared. Reichmann gives credit to Jennie T. Jennings and her ALA Committee in 1925 for originating six factors that should be included in compiling true cataloging costs: administration, equipment, conditions of work, hours of work, procedure, statistics, and cooperative cataloging [11]. Fremont Rider built on this idea in 1936 and said that administra- tion and overhead should be calculated as part of cataloging costs, by which he meant rent or cost of housing the catalog department, heating, lighting, water, telephone costs, printing, stationery and postage, depre- ciation, insurance, janitorial services, and building repairs. Rider in 1936 gives two figures for cataloging costs at his library, Wesleyan, one for labor, $0.70 per volume, and a second figure, $0.92 per volume, for labor plus overhead, including all the aforementioned items [12]. In 1937, R. A. Miller did a time and cost analysis using data from the University of Iowa and came up with the figure of only $0.38 per volume for cataloging, an unusually low figure for its time [11]. Jerrold Orne collected cataloging cost statistics at Washington Univer- sity in St. Louis for three years, from 1945-46 through 1947-48, and claimed that he reduced cataloging costs from $1.01 to $0.71 in 1947-48 [13]. John Minto Dawson wrote a dissertation at the Graduate Library School of the University of Chicago, which was published as an article in 1957. He found that cataloging costs for eleven university libraries in 1948 varied from $2.26 to $5.90 per title. He also considered the feasi- bility of centralized cataloging for research libraries in addition to that done by LC. He found that there was sufficient duplication in the ordering of materials by nine research libraries to justify centralized and cooperative cataloging among them. He also studied the use of LC cataloging copy by the nine research libraries and found that they subjected LC copy to more revisions than he considered necessary, both in descriptive cataloging and in subject headings and call numbers. He felt that fewer changes would result in cheaper but still usable copy. Dawson also advocated that LC, as the only functioning centralized
HISTORIC CATALOGING COSTS 11 cataloging center in the United States at the time, catalog more foreign- language materials for the benefit of research libraries. Dawson foresaw the usefulness of centralized and cooperative cataloging, but he could not foresee the inventions that would make them possible in their cur- rent form (OCLC, RLIN, etc.) a few years later [14]. As Fussler has noted more recently, LC has, in fact, done what Dawson recommended and gone beyond the recommendation with its "National Program of Acquisitions and Cataloging" [15]. Felix Reichmann cites two later sets of cost statistics, one for $3.34 per volume from California at Berkeley in 1949, and the other for $3.66 per title from Columbia in 1950-5 1 [1 1]. Catherine MacQuarrie did a cataloging cost survey of school, academic, and public libraries in South- ern California in 1962 and came up with a large mass of statistical information. Her figures for six college libraries are reported in both per-volume costs and per-title costs. The range of per-volume costs was from $3.14 to $4.88, with an average of $4.13 per volume. The range of per-title costs was from $3.42 to $8.26, with an average of $6.27 per title. MacQuarrie is the only librarian who has claimed that average costs should be prescriptive. She says that average costs should be a "check and a goal" [16]. This is true, however, only for libraries that closely resemble one another in size, budget, clientele, and location. Ichiko T. Morita and D. Kaye Gapen did a before-and-after-OCLC study of cataloging costs at Ohio State from 1970 through 1975. They compared pre-OCLC cataloging with OCLC cataloging. They found that in 1970 28 percent of their library's cataloging was "quick editing" with an average cost of $5.02 per title and 71 percent of its cataloging was original cataloging with an average of $12.70 per title. In 1975 with OCLC, the "quick editing" had grown to 62 percent of their library's cataloging, with an average cost of $7.75 per title, and the original cataloging had fallen to 38 percent of the work, with an average cost of $16.90 per title. If one makes allowance for the difference in percent- ages, the average costs then were $10.42 per title in 1970 and $11.22 per title in 1975, an increase of 7.6 percent. They conclude that if it had not been for the high rate of inflation during this period, cataloging costs would have fallen [17]. And they are quite correct, for the wholesale commodity price index rose during the period that Morita and Gapen studied from 247.5 (of the 1930 base figure) in 1970 to 392.2 in 1975, an increase of 58.4 percent [18]. The cataloging cost figures calculated by Morita and Gapen in 1970 and 1975 are the latest figures to appear in the literature, and the absence of more recent statistics necessitated the cataloging cost survey, which appears in Section II, where the latest cataloging cost figure is $17.17 for 1985-86. If the $0.40 cataloging cost figure of 1876 is representative and the $17.17 figure for 1985-86 is valid, cataloging
12 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY costs have increased 4,292 percent during the past 110 years. The above figures all appear in table 3. Salary Statistics Table 3 is a comparison among four sets of figures. First, all of the available cataloging costs that have been published in the literature have been listed chronologically. These cataloging costs are mostly for large libraries or academic libraries when available. An attempt has then been made to supply a salary figure for the year of each cataloging cost, with preference given to figures for salaries of large academic libraries. Salary statistics are rare in the early days of the library profession. The first figures available come from Pratt Institute, which began taking a survey of its graduates and their salaries in 1896 and found that its graduates had an average salary of $607 in 1896 and of $686 in 1898 [19]. Today these salaries seem to be unusually low, but in the context of their time, they were quite high. The country was experiencing a severe depression in 1896. Salaries for other occupations were much lower. For example, the average wage in manufacturing was $427 in 1890 and $540 in 1914. School teachers averaged only $328 per year in 1900, and in the same year federal postal employees were really well paid at an average of $925 [20]. This average for Pratt graduates is probably not typical of librarians as a whole because Pratt graduates find jobs primarily in the New York metropolitan area where salaries historically have been higher than salaries nationwide. For example, salary statistics gathered by ALA in 1923 indicate that New York and Brooklyn paid higher salaries to school librarians than did Akron, Denver, Indianapolis, Louisville, Oak- land, or Washington [21]. Salary statistics gathered by ALA in 1933 for public librarian salaries indicate that New York and Brooklyn paid higher salaries than did Baltimore, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, New Orleans, and Toledo [22]. The next published salaries were those of five academic libraries which participated in the ALA cataloging test. The identity of only two is known, and their salaries for 1913-14 are as follows: No. 10 $906 No. 11 581 No. 12 (Columbia) 985 No. 14 505 No. 15 (Yale) 502 Average 695 The average salary for these five libraries was $695 in 1913-14 [7]. Salaries increased considerably during the 1920s and so did published salary statistics, but during the Great Depression salaries experienced their first decline. For example, 63 percent of Pratt Institute graduates

14 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY suffered salary cuts between 1931 and 1934 [23]. During the 1920s and the 1930s ALA collected salary statistics from several prestigious col- leges and several large state universities and published them in the ALA Bulletin, usually on one full page or more in the form of a large table, according to various categories of workers, such as department heads, professional assistants, and occasionally other groups, such as catalogers. ALA did not find a one-figure average for all of the groups of profes- sional librarians in all of the libraries. I have done this, however, and the results are found in table 3 for the years between 1922 and 1937, inclusively. This one-figure average does not include nonprofessional assistants or library directors because ALA omitted the latter from the earliest tables. These salary figures reduced to one figure are as follows: for 1925 the average university library salary was $1,683 [24]; for 1929, $1,901 [25]; for 1930, $1,866 [26]; for 1936, $1,888 [27]; and for 1937, $2,334 [28]. Maurice Seay collected salary statitics from sixty-three members of the Association of Land-Grant Colleges and Universities and of the National Association of State Universities and published a table of salary statistics whose average for the academic year 1948 was $3,112 [29]. For the year 1947 and for the years 1949-51, the salary scale tables for the University of California, Berkeley, have been used and, like the earlier ALA tables, reduced to a one-figure average by the author. California was selected because its salary scale was published and available, not because its salary scale is typical. The University of California, Berkeley, average salary for the year 1947 was $3,616 [30]; for 1949, $4,526 [31]; and for 1951, $5,115 [32]. A survey of academic librarians' salaries was taken by Theodore Sa- more for 1961-62, and again a table of salary statistics has been reduced to one number. The average salary for academic librarians for 1961-62 was $6,857 [33]. For the year 1970, ALA again conducted a salary survey, but this time it did not give statistics by universities. Instead, it took figures from personal members and published the average salaries by various categories of librarians. The average salary for librarians in university libraries in 1970 was $12,587 [34]. ALA took another survey for academic librarians in 1975-76, and the average academic librarian's salary was $14,207 [35]. The Association of Research Libraries began publishing salary figures in the 1980s and began ranking the top 105 of its member libraries in order of their median salary. For the year 1984- 85, the University of Houston held the median position of number 52 out of 105 libraries, and its salary was $24,917. The ARL also found that the average salary, including the directors' salaries, was $27,935. Histori- cally the salary of the director has been as much as or even more than three times that of the lowest-paid professional, so that adding the
HISTORIC CATALOGING COSTS 15 directors' salaries in with the other figures raises the average consider- ably [361. The most recently published salary figures were compiled by ALA for 1986 [37]. These figures give mean salary by eleven job titles and for five regions. I selected eleven mean salaries for university librarians and, by averaging these, extracted an average salary of $28,533. If the 1896 and 1986 salary figures are representative of librarians' salaries, then salaries have increased 4,700 percent in the past ninety years. Measurements of Inflation In addition to the figures for the cost of cataloging and the salary figures in table 3, there are two sets of figures by which to measure the rate of inflation chronologically: the wholesale commodity price index and the price of gold. The base year for the wholesale commodity price index is 1930, which equals 100. All of the fluctuating figures are in relation to prices in this year. The figures for the wholesale commodity price index from 1876 through 1975 are taken from The Golden Constant by Roy W. Jastram [18]. The figure for 1985 is taken from the Statistical Abstract of the United States, 1986 [38] and for 1986 from the World Almanac and Book of Facts, 1987 [39]. The price of gold was fixed by the U.S. government from 1835 to 1933 at $20.67 per ounce and at $35.00 an ounce afterward [18]. Ownership of gold by U.S. citizens was illegal between 1934 [40] and 1974 [41]. The price of gold on the London Exchange began to rise in 1970 [42] and in 1974, when Americans were allowed to own gold again, the price rose to $141 per ounce [43]. It reached a peak of $590 per ounce briefly in 1981 when inflation was high [44], but it declined thereafter to its 1986 price of $328.80 per ounce [45]. The statistics for these two measurements of inflation, the wholesale commodity price index and the price of gold, are the most reliable of all statistics in table 3. The wholesale commodity price index has increased 729 percent between 1876 and 1986, and the price of gold has increased 1,590 percent during the same period. Therefore, one may conclude that the cost of cataloging has increased much more than the rate of inflation, but not quite so much as the salary rate during the same period. IV. Conclusion Section 1 shows that Library of Congress cataloging copy has increased 24 percent in number of characters (letters and numbers) between samples taken from the Pre-56 Imprints and samples taken from the NUC
16 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY 1982, which contain books cataloged in 1981. Library of Congress cataloging has increased in complexity, defined as the number of fields, the number of entries, and the number of subject heading subdivisions on cataloging copy, between 19 percent and 156 percent. There are two reasons for this increase in size and complexity. First, there are more books nowadays to distinguish one from another, and, second, library materials are becoming more voluminous and complex themselves. Sec- tion II indicates that most academic libraries, 82.9 percent, use OCLC over any other bibliographic utility. Many libraries, 37.7 percent, still have their public catalogs in the form of card catalogs only. Cataloging costs are of only moderate concern to most academic libraries. Most libraries, 69.2 percent, are unable to state what their cataloging costs are. The per-volume figure of $17.17 is a very rough, approximate estimate for monographic cataloging costs for large academic libraries in 1985- 86. Most large academic libraries have not been much affected by the depression of 1981-82. The most popular method of cutting costs, 35 percent, is to use cheaper labor. There is a small countertrend, 13.7 percent, toward less than AACR2 cataloging, that is, toward brief cataloging, and the Library of Congress is part of this countertrend. Only 24.8 percent of academic libraries use "whitelists." Quality is the overwhelming concern of academic libraries in cataloging; quantity is second in importance; and cost is third. Section III indicates that the rate of inflation as measured by the wholesale commodity price index has been 729 percent during the past 110 years and, as measured by the price of gold, has been 1,590 percent during the same period. The cost of cataloging, however, in spite of the widespread use of Library of Congress cataloging copy, the use of cheap labor, and the advent of OCLC and other cooperative cataloging ventures, has gone up roughly and approximately 4,292 percent during the same 110 years. But this rate of increase is less than the rate of salary increases during the past ninety years, which is approximately 4,700 percent. Appendix A Cataloging Cost Questionnaire 1.
