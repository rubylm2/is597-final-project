THE OCCUPATIONS OF REGISTERED BORROWERS IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY WALTER H. KAISER registration figure which repre- sents borrowers registered for a 1 consistent and definite time period is a rough but useful indicator of the library's acceptance by the public. The figure becomes more useful as it is analyzed into specific and significant terms-age, education, occupation, sex, race, etc. The effects of these factors on reading and library use have been re- corded in other publications. This segmental report of registration is concerned with ascertaining the occu- pations of one public library's borrowers and with relating the occupational groups found in the library registration to those in the total population. The community in which this study was made is Muncie, Indiana, a city which was the subject of the Lynds' two noteworthy volumes, Middletown and Middletown in Transition. These two volumes afford ample information for those who might wish to explore the community backgrounds of the public library. During the period January, I94I- June, 1942, the occupations of 6,723 adult borrowers of the Muncie Public Library were tabulated under the major occupation groups used by the Bureau of the Census. These groups are in- clusive but are sufficiently specific to re- veal useful information. NOTE ON METHOD In the compilation of the tables several adjustments of the registration data were made to allow comparisons with the 1940 Census data. Thus it was necessary to enlarge each occupational grouping of registered borrowers to the figure repre- senting their true or approximate num- ber in the total registration. The regis- tration period for the library is three years, but the study was carried on for only eighteen months. During this period 55.5 per cent of the total adult registration and 58.4 per cent of the total juvenile registration were recorded. These two groups were enlarged so that both reflected ioo per cent of the actual registration. Another correction factor was em- ployed in arriving at the total number of persons in each occupational group in the population served by the library, since occupational data, except for the enumeration of farmers, were available for the city of Muncie only, while the library serves both Muncie and the township in which Muncie is located. Approximately 9.2 per cent of the popu- lation of the township resides outside the city limits. The population figure for farmers was deduced from Census data, and the remaining groups were each en- larged to reflect the population of the township.' The writer's personal ob- servation of the occupational character of the population residing in the town- ship outside Muncie permits this ad- justment with a minimum of error. The I All the Census data used in this study and included in the tables appear in U.S. Bureau of the Census, r6th Census of ilke United States, rg4o: Population: Second Series: Characteristics of the Population: Indiana (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1942), Tables 28, 31, 32, and 33.

I20 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY map in the Lynds' Middletoun in Transi- tion is cited in confirmation. In tabulating the registration data, persons fourteen years and over were assumed to hold adult cards, since the library grants adult cards to those boys and girls who have completed eight grades. The registration and the Census data as used in this study which relate to the occupation-not-reported group require explanation. For this group the library registration figure includes those who in the Census data are reported as "Un- able To Work" or "Seeking Work," and probably a small percentage of persons for whom the information could not be obtained. To this group were related the Census data for those "On Public Work," "Seeking Work," "Unable To Work," "In Institutions," and "Other" and "Occupation Not Reported." Some de- gree of error is probably existent for each group because of this rationaliza- tion of the data, but the error is not likely to be important. The following occupational groups were considered as one group in compiling the registration figure for the service workers: "Domestic Service Workers"; "Service Workers, except Domestic"; and "Protective Service Workers." "Farm Laborers" (there were only thirty in the Census data) were not tabulated as such but were included as laborers. COMMENTS AND CONCLUSIONS The following high lights of the report and related comments are noted briefly for the convenience of the reader. Some of these proceed directly from only one statistical table; others from several tables; and still others are the writer's own interpretations and opinions. i. The largest single group which is registered by the library is the juvenile group (aged five to thirteen), which accounts for 34 per cent of the total library registration. Housewives, with I9 per cent, and students, with 14 per cent, follow in order.

The largest single group in the population is the juvenile group (aged one to thirteen), which comprises 23 per cent of the total population, fol- lowed closely by the housewives, with 22 per cent. 3. Of the total library registration, 66 per cent is adult and 34 per cent is juvenile. 4. Of the students (both juvenile and adult) in the population, 76 per cent are registered. Only 24 per cent of adults, excluding "adult" students, are regis- tered. 5. The group which shows the largest percentage of its membership registered by the library is the juvenile group (8I per cent), followed by the "adult" students (68 per cent), and the profession- al group (57 per cent). After these groups the range in percentage of a group's registration is from 42 per cent for the clerical to 4 per cent for the operatives. 6. The students group, which repre- sents 9 per cent of the total adult popu- lation, accounts for 22 per cent of the total adult registration. The profes- sional group, which represents 4 per cent of the total adult population, is 7 per cent of the total adult registration. Of the housewives-the largest in numbers of the adult groups-29 per cent are regis- tered. Operatives, who comprise I3 per cent of the total adult population, ac- count for only 2 per cent of the total adult registration and have but 4 per cent-the lowest of all groups-of their group registered. 7. The Muncie city schools have 88 per cent of the juvenile population group (aged five to thirteen) in school. Of this same age group, 8i per cent are registered by the library. 8. Only i6 per cent of the proprietors group is registered, ranking ninth in the percentage of the members of its group registered. Because of the strategic posi- tion of this group in the determination of the library's tax rate, the writer here departs from figures to express an opin- ion. It would seem that this group's relatively high economic level, with its consequent effects on the personal pur- TABLE 3 COMPARISON OF PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LIBRARY REGISTRATION AND PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL POPULATION, BY JUVENILE AND ADULT GROUPS Percentage Percentage Group of Total of Total Library Population Registration Juvenile (thirteen and under) ................. 34 23 Adult .................. 66 78 Housewives ............

122 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY chase of books and magazines, the rental of books, and the allocation of its time for business, social, and community activities, will tend to keep the per- centage of registration down. Fortunate- ly, this group contains some of the strongest supporters that the library has in the community, in spite of the fact that they are not registered borrowers of the library. This group, too, has among its members some who are the most effective in opposition to the li- brary's request for appropriations. This opposition does not always proceed from a stinginess with public funds but often from lack of information as to what the library is doing in the community. Thus it is important that the nonlibrary users of this group be given a picture of the place of the library in the community through board members, the librarian, the staff, and other mediums. o. If the juvenile and students groups are considered together as students, this combination of similar groups accountsfor 49 per cent of all library registration. If housewives are added to this grouping, we find that 68 per cent of the total library registration is made up of students and housewives-and this figure does not in- clude the women to be found in the pro- fessional, clerical, services, and other groups. The population data reveal that women in the whole population (includ- ing housewives), children in the age group one to thirteen years, and the students group (a group considered "children" by many), comprise about 6S per cent of the total population. One occasionally hears the comment that the public library serves mostly women and children, a comment which usually is given as a veiled criticism; but the popu- lation data indicate that it could not be otherwise. io. The Census data throw some light on the library's registration potential. There are several groups in the com- munity which offer little if any pos- sibility of being registered. One group, the largest which has no representation in the registration figure, is made up of TABLE 5 EMPLOYMENT STATUS: PERSONS FOURTEEN YEARS AND OVER: MUNCIE Male Female In labor force ................................1..........

A second group whose chances for registra- tion seem small is made up of persons twenty-five years of age or older who have completed from none to four grades in school. Not many of the 2,476 persons in this group are likely to have mastered the techniques and skills neces- sary to the easy reading of books. It should be noted, too, that functional illiteracy undoubtedly exists to some ex- tent among those who have completed more than four grades. The third group from which registra- tion will be small is composed of per- sons over seventy-five years of age. Ad- vanced age with its accompanying mental and physical disabilities will re- move most of this group, I,098 in num- ber, from the registration potential. Some registered borrowers, of course, will be found among those over seventy- five, but their numbers will be more than offset by those under seventy-five who are not registered because of mental and physical disabillties due to age. The number of persons in the fore- going three groups is 8,369, or 15 per cent of the total population. Thus, if only tangible and reasonable data of edu- cation and age are considered in the light of their effects on registration, it presents a more accurate picture to say that 40 per cent of the population potentially available for registration is registered than to say that 33 per cent of the actual population is registered. The remaining 6o per cent theoretically available for registration by the library is composed of persons who will fall into the following groups: (a) those who do not desire to read books; (b) those who have no time to read books; (c) those who are handicapped by functional illiteracy and cannot read books now available; (d) those who have physical and mental disabilities preventing the reading of books; (e) those who secure books else- where than from the library; (f) those who have violated library rules and are blocked from using the library; (g) those former patrons who are dissatisfied with the library for one reason or another TABLE 6 COMPOSITION OF THE POPULATION: SEX, RACE, AND NATIVITY: CENTER TOWNSHIP Male Female Total Total population. 27,465 27,648 55,1113 Native white . 25,704 25,890 51,594 Foreign born .273 221 494 Negro ....1,474 I ,530 3,004 Other races . 4 7 21 Per cent native white . . . 93.6 Percent foreign-born .. ........ ........ 0. 9 Per cent Negro ....... ........ ........ 5 5 TABLE 7 COMPOSITION OF THE POPULATION: SCHOOL ATTENDANCE: MUNCIE Persons five and six years old .......... i,487 Number attending school ........... 809 Per cent .......................... 54.4 Persons seven to thirteen years old. 5,28i Number attending school ........... 5,I6I Per cent .......................... 97.7 Persons fourteen and fifteen years old... .1,573 Number attending school ...... 1..... ,514 Per cent .......................... 96.2 Persons sixteen and seventeen years old.

The factors affecting registration are easy to list, but isolating and identifying the factor or factors, and in the correct degree, for each group or individual in a large community seem an impossible task. The factors are such that a weak library in one community can register a higher percentage of its population than a strong library in another community, the registration period for both being the same. An experiment to ascertain to what extent the library itself determines the registration potential could be made by selecting a group which ranks low in registration and applying all possible methods to raise the registration figure. Such an experiment would be the most important justification for the registra- tion study, laying the groundwork for the broadening and intensification of library service. One condition which may prevent registration from rising far beyond the generally accepted standards in the near future is the presence in the adult popu- TABLE 8 COMPOSITION OF THE POPULATION: YEARS OF SCHOOL COMPLETED: MUNCIE Male Female Total Twenty-five years old and over ................

THE OCCUPATIONS OF LIBRARY BORROWERS I25 lation of persons who do not read books because available books are not geared to their reading ability. Miss Tompkins has estimated this group to comprise 50 per cent of the adult population.2 If this is true, then nearly one-third of the total population would be found in such a group in Muncie. Such a condition may not exist in Muncie to the extent of Miss Tompkins' I934 estimate; but that it does exist in some degree is clear. The library itself has undoubtedly decreased the number of potential regis- trants through its policy with respect to fines. The exact number of inactive cards on file because of fines is not known, but they do exist; and it is reasonable to expect that, as these cards expire, many will not be renewed. Over a period of years, unless the fines are re- mitted, the number of such blocked per- sons will be considerable. That this is a problem in many libraries is made clear by the many articles on the subject in professional journals. A few libraries have even discontinued charging fines to children.3 The writer believes, although the matter has not gone further than thought in this library, that fines in- curred for overdue books (but not for damaged or lost books) may well be automatically canceled when the per capita income of the library equals the amount of the fine, the credit being allowed, say, either semiannually or annually. There should be a statute of limitations on fines, especially in the case of fines for overdue books. It hardly seems equitable for the library to impose a permanent penalty (permanent in the sense that a fine does amount to this for some persons) for a temporary incon- venience to the community, particularly since such persons must continue to pay taxes for the library services which are denied them. Such a method of remitting fines as here suggested would have in its favor the strong points of being definite, reasonable, and useful as a yardstick. To recapitulate: Two facts of the regis- tration report stand out-the library does a good job in registering students, both juvenile and adult, securing about three-fourths of that group, but falls down in registering adults, of whom it secures only about one-fourth. Of the adult groups, the professional, a group which has long been accustomed to using books for both professional and personal reasons, shows the highest percentage of registration, but still only 57 per cent of their group is registered. It is, therefore, among the adult groups, which, excluding students, con- stitute about 70 per cent of the popu- lation, that the library will have to find new borrowers if the level of registration is to be noticeably raised. Methods of accomplishing this end are still in the speculative stage, but a knowledge of the facts, as contained in. the registration report, is a useful first step in the process. 2Miriam D.
