A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF FACTORS INFLUENCING THE OUTCOME OF CHALLENGES TO LIBRARY MATERIALS IN SECONDARY SCHOOL SETTINGS' Dianne McAfee Hopkins2 This study addresses the research question, "What are the variables that influ- ence the outcome of challenges to school library materials at the secondary level?" A conceptual model is provided that describes the outcome of challenges to materials in terms of retention, restriction, and removal. The model was derived from research findings in library and information science, educational administration, behavioral science, and communications and suggests that the path from the challenge to the outcome is complex. The model contains several classes of variables, including district materials selection policy; school environ- ment; community environment; and initiator of challenge. Variable classes of special interest in the present study are the characteristics of the librarian, which emphasize the psychological factors of locus of control and dogmatism, and complaint background, which focuses on whether the complaint was oral or written and whether there was active support for the retention or the removal of materials. The validity of the model was tested using survey research methods with a national sample of school librarians reporting challenges to materials. The results were found generally to support the model. Introduction, Definitions, and Conceptual Framework The question of access to information for children and young adults, particularly from the standpoint of intellectual freedom, is one of broad and sustained interest. In spite of this interest, there has been surpris- ingly little systematic research that has moved the profession forward 1.

CHALLENGES TO LIBRARY MATERIALS 41 in its understanding of intellectual freedom questions or in its prepara- tion for and response to challenges to materials in libraries. Direct challenges to materials found in school libraries have been of particular concern to proponents of intellectual freedom. Yet aside from occasional studies and periodic status reports of challenge results, little is known about the challenge process. This article reports the results of the testing, on a national level, of a conceptual model that addressed the question, "What are the variables that are most likely to influence the outcome of challenges to school library materials at the secondary level?" For purposes of the present study, "challenge" is defined as an oral or written complaint about the appropriateness of school library material(s). "Outcome" is defined as the resolution of such a challenge and is viewed in terms of retention, restriction, or removal of challenged material. In retention, material that is thought to be appropriate for the school library remains on open shelves and is readily accessible to users of the library. In restriction, material that is thought to be suitable for some students in the school but questionable for others is given limited access, such as placement on a restricted shelf for access only through the librarian or other authority figure. In removal, material that is thought to be inappropriate for the school and its students is taken out of the school library altogether. The conceptual model on which the study is based was developed and discussed by Dianne McAfee Hopkins [1]. The model was based on a review and analysis of intellectual freedom research in library and information science; educational administration research including for- mal and informal organizations, school climate, and supervisor/subordi- nate relationships; behavioral science research relating to personality, power, and authority; and communications research including local me- dia (such as newspapers) and community interactions. In the model tested in the present study, outcome of a challenge to school library material was seen as affected by five major classes of variables: district materials selection policy, school environment, community environ- ment, initiator of the challenge, and selected personal and professional characteristics of the librarian. The research review suggested that the primary variables influencing whether library materials in school set- tings are retained, restricted, or removed are very complex and may well center around the school librarian and the principal and around the leadership or lack thereof that either or both exert throughout the challenge process. In the field of library and information science, the model was strongly influenced by the research and discussions of Marjorie Fiske [2], John J. Farley [3], Charles H. Busha [4], Claire St. Clere England [5], Michael J. Pope [6], and Judith Serebnick [7]. Farley's study focused specifically
42 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY on school libraries. Fiske's study included school and public libraries; Pope's study included school, public, and college libraries. Busha and England focused on public libraries. While the Busha and England re- search is not generalizable to school libraries, it is included because, when examined along with other research in intellectual freedom, the research offered background information or confirmed possible key variables for the research question. The well-known Fiske study of book selection, challenges, and censor- ship focused on selected California school and public libraries in the 1950s [2]. It has been called the most influential research on intellectual freedom in U.S. libraries [7, p. 97]. Fiske's findings offered useful infor- mation to the model in many areas including materials selection policy; librarians' characteristics such as length of service, self-esteem, sense of pressure in selections, and level of formal education; school environ- ment, including the influence of the school administrator on the librar- ian; community environment, including the influence of local media; and the initiator of the challenge. Farley [3] explored precensorship in acquisitions, circulation, and use of books in the collections of forty-three senior high schools in Nassau County, New York. He sought to ascertain responsibility and rationales for restrictions. Farley's findings offered information useful to the model relating to librarians' characteristics, including length of profes- sional service, and to school environment, including the influence of school administrators on the librarian. Busha [4] studied midwestern public librarians to determine their attitudes toward intellectual freedom, censorship, and selected authori- tarian beliefs. Busha's findings offered insights into librarians' personal characteristics such as age, level of formal education, and authoritarian beliefs; school environment, including the possible influence of adminis- trators on the librarian; and community environment, including the relationship between community size and librarians' attitudes toward censorship. England [5] studied public librarians in six cities in Ontario, Canada. She sought to discover attitudes and perceptual factors influencing what she termed the "censorship activity" of public librarians. England's find- ings provided information useful to the model in the areas of character- istics of the librarian, including age and sense of pressure in selections, and community environment. Pope [6] analyzed the opinions of school, public, and college librarians on sexually oriented literature. Pope's findings offered useful informa- tion in the areas of characteristics of the librarian such as age and level of formal education and of school environment, including the relationship between school enrollment and restrictiveness.
CHALLENGES TO LIBRARY MATERIALS 43 Serebnick [7] provided a very useful review of research relating to censorship in libraries. She noted research patterns as well as relation- ships among variables. Serebnick also provided a conceptual framework for further research on selection and censorship in libraries. Other reports, while less comprehensive and often status reports, when taken as a whole, offered support for suggested variables. Selected studies include those of Mary L. Woodworth [8], Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction [9, 10, 1 1], Limiting What Children Shall Read [12], Pauletta Brown Bracy [13], Fran McDonald [141, and David Jenkinson [15]. Review monographs were used to identify major theories and strands of thought outside library and information science. Insights from educa- tional administration research were based on reviews by Wayne K. Hoy and Patrick B. Forsyth [16] and Paula Silver [17]. Behavioral science research relating to personality, power, and authority was usefully sum- marized by Leonard W. Doob [ 18]. Ideas from communications research including local media and community interactions were taken from Vin- cent Price and Donald F. Roberts [19], Donald F. Roberts [20], William L. Rivers et al. [21], and Wilbur Schramm [22]. Derivation of the model is fully described in [1]. The model was first tested in a state-based exploratory study of Wisconsin's public middle, junior, and senior high school libraries in the spring of 1988. The results generally supported the model, were useful in the design of the national study, and were reported in the research literature [23]. Following the exploratory study described in [23], the model was tested through a national study focusing on public secondary school libraries in the 1989-90 school year. Based on the results, a revised, but similar, model emerged. The revised model differs from the original in that the variable class, "complaint background," was added. This article focuses on the revised conceptual model, depicted in figure 1, and the research results on which the model is based. A fuller report of the research was provided to the U.S. Department of Education, which pro- vided primary funding for the study [24].3 Research Design and Methodology The national study, reported in the present article, was conducted in two phases. First, a sample was drawn from the population of all second- ary public schools in the United States, with the expectation that a man- 3.

In the second phase, the secondary public schools that had experienced challenges were studied, with a focus on the most recent challenge occurring in a three-year period. The population from which the sample was selected came from the "1987-88 Universe of Public Education Agencies," which lists the names and addresses of public schools at kindergarten through twelve levels throughout the United States. Of these, 34,644 schools fit the targeted population, that is, schools reporting grades seven and above. This list- ing was obtained from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) [25]. A proportionate, stratified, random sample of schools with grades seven or higher was selected for the population. See table 1 for the regional breakdown. For each state, samples were drawn representing seven community sizes as defined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census (see App. A for a list of the seven community sizes). The community sizes ranged from "large central city," with greater than or equal to six thousand persons per square mile, to "rural," with a population less than 2,500 and defined as rural by the U.S. Bureau of the Census (see table 2). Of the 6,617 schools selected for the sample, 6,557 were used. The remainder of the surveys were undeliverable or duplicates or were sent to ineligible institutions (special schools, et cetera). A one-page question- naire was directed to "school library media specialist" at each of the 6,557 schools in the sample and was mailed in November 1989. The

The overall response rate was 72 percent; 4,736 of the 6,557 eligible addresses were completed and returned. Of these, 1,661 or 35.9 percent indicated that challenges had occurred. These results are reported in a separate article [26]. Libraries in which challenges to library materials occurred during the period 1986-89 became the focus of the second part of the study. A questionnaire was developed for the school librarian and was divided into four main parts. The first section focused on background informa- tion about the school, the district, and the librarian. The next section
46 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY focused on school library materials selection and on challenges oc- curring to school library materials since September 1987. The third section focused on the most recently resolved complaint about library materials occurring since September 1987. The last section focused on the librarian's perspectives including professional experience, psycho- logical makeup, and views about challenges to library materials. See reference [24] for a copy of the full questionnaire. The questionnaire was reviewed comprehensively by a consultant, a panel of experts, and others.4 In addition, it was field-tested with the following subjects: twenty graduate-level students in two classes in the School of Library and Information Studies, University of Wisconsin- Madison; ten students in the school library program at North Carolina Central University's School of Library and Information Sciences; twelve building-level public and private secondary-level school librarians in southern Wisconsin; fifty U.S. secondary school librarians randomly se- lected who had not been included in the phase 1 sample; and fifty school librarians and district-level supervisors in thirteen U.S. states recom- mended by state-level library media consultants. As a result of these reviews and field tests, the questionnaire was revised several times be- fore it was finally distributed. The overall response rate was 70 percent; 1,17 1 of the 1,661 question- naires were completed and returned. Of the 1,171 respondents, 739 or 63.1 percent indicated that they experienced challenges during the pe- riod under investigation. Data analyses included general frequency and percentage informa- tion, followed by x2 analyses or analyses of variance as appropriate. The value chosen to indicate statistical significance was P < .05. Standardized residuals were used in the x2 analyses to determine those cells contribut- ing to overall significance.5 For analyses of variance that were found to be significant, Scheff6 tests were conducted.6 Finally, a series of logistic 4. 1 express special appreciation to the study's research consultant, Douglas L. Zweizig, School of Library and Information Studies, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Ap- preciation is also expressed to Rebecca P. Butler, research assistant, and to the members of the study's panel of experts: Pauletta Brown Bracy (North Carolina Central Univer- sity), Frances Beck McDonald (Mankato State University), Alvin Schrader (University of Alberta, Canada), and Judith Serebnick (Indiana University). I conferred with research consultant Zweizig throughout the study on, in addition to questionnaire design, areas including data analysis and overall research design. 5. Standardized residuals are a by-product of a x2 analysis. They are a measure of how well the actual number of responses agree with the expected number of the table cell in which they appear, based on the column and row totals, and are expressed in terms of standard deviations. A value greater than or equal to + 2 or less than or equal to - 2 can be considered significantly different than expected at the .05 level of significance. 6. Analysis of variance is used to test for statistical significance in the level of a response across several groups. The resulting P value will indicate if the differences are signifi- cant "taken as whole" (that is, across all of the several groups at once). Further, post
CHALLENGES TO LIBRARY MATERIALS 47 regressions were performed to identify the significance of factors and individual questions in explaining outcome. Findings The findings focus on the dependent variable, outcome to challenges. Of the 739 respondents reporting challenges, 606 indicated that the outcome to the challenge was retention, restriction, or removal. Three hundred seventeen respondents or 52.3 percent indicated that chal- lenged material was retained. One hundred thirty-one or 21.6 percent indicated that the challenged material was restricted, and 158 or 26.1 percent indicated that the challenged material was removed. The re- maining 112 respondents to this question selected "other," which in- cluded a variety of possibilities such as the transfer of titles to another school elsewhere in the district and multiple outcomes when more than one title was challenged. Region and Type of Community The data on challenge outcome were analyzed in terms of the four regions of the United States as defined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census (see App. B). The lowest rate of retention among the regions was re- ported in the South at 42.7 percent. A x2 test examined region and outcome. Differences were found to be significant at the P < .05 level (see table 3). Standardized residuals showed that challenges occurring in the South were less likely to result in retention and more likely to result in restriction when compared to other regions. The data on outcomes were also analyzed in terms of types of commu- nities. There was no significant difference in outcome according to type of community. Material Selection Policy The variables related to the materials selection policy focused on the existence of a policy, the level of formality of the policy, and the degree to which the policy was used with a given challenge. Having a policy was found to be significantly related to challenges to materials (P < .05), with board-approved written policies resulting most often in retention compared to no policy, informal policy, and written but not approved policy (see table 4). When the policy was used, material had a greater likelihood of reten- hoc testing is necessary to determine which of the specific groups are statistically differ- ent. Scheffe tests are one way of testing significance across groups pairwise while main- taining an overall significance level of P < .05.

50 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY tion than when the policy was not used. When policies were not used, material was less likely to be retained and more likely to be removed (see tables 5 and 6). School Environment School and district enrollments.-Data on student enrollment were ana- lyzed in terms of outcome; significant differences were found. Enroll- ments were grouped as below 500, 500-699, 700-999, 1,000-1,499, and 1,500 and over (X2 [df = 8, N = 586] = 20.54392, P < .05). Standardized residuals revealed that material was retained less and re- moved more in schools with enrollments below 500. Materials were re- tained more in schools with over 1,500 when compared to other cat- egories. District-wide enrollments were not significantly related to the outcome of challenged material. Role of p-rincipal and teachers.-The support of the principal was found to be significantly related to outcome (see table 7). Results of a one-way analysis of variance showed that when the principal was seen by the librarian as supportive, challenges were more likely to result in reten- tion. Where the principal was viewed as less supportive, challenges were more likely to result in removal or restriction. Table 7 also shows that support of teachers made a difference in outcome. Results of a one-way analysis of variance showed that where teachers were seen as supportive, challenges were more likely to result in retention. Where teachers were viewed as less supportive, challenges were likely to result in removal or restriction. Assistance within the school district.-Whether respondents sought assis- tance from school district staff or organizations within the district was also found to have a significant relationship to the outcome of chal- lenged materials. Because a scale was used, a one-way analysis of vari- ance was performed. There was a higher retention rate for those who sought assistance in the district than for those who did not (see table 8). Respondents also reported assistance received within the district. Those who received assistance were more likely to have material re- tained and less likely to have material removed when compared to those who did not. Respondents selected from several categories, identified in table 9. There was a statistically significant difference in outcome for those receiving assistance within the district compared to those who did not: X2 (df = 2, N = 588) = 27.16388, P < .05. When data for each choice category were examined using x2, statistical significance was found for all categories except local teacher organization (see table 9).

Community Environment Local media.-Variables related to local media were not significantly re- lated to outcome. In more than 90 percent of the responses, local media were unaware of the challenge. Where the media had knowledge of the challenge, responses were mixed. Differences were not statistically associated with differences in outcome when a one-way analysis of vari- ance was performed. Assistance outside the district.-Whether respondents sought assistance outside the district was significantly related to outcome. Because respon- dents used a scale, a one-way analysis of variance was performed. Al- though most respondents did not seek outside assistance, those who did had a higher rate of retention and a lower rate of removal than those who did not (see table 8). Respondents also reported on assistance received from outside the
54 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY district. There was a statistically significant difference in outcome for those receiving assistance compared to those that did not: x2 (df = 2, N = 573) = 8.97706, P < .05. However, when the data for each choice category were examined using x2, the only category that related to out- come was ("other": x2 (df = 2, N = 573) = 9.52329, P < .05. Sources specified as "other" varied and included the Cooperative Children's Book Center (located at the University of Wisconsin-Madison), pub- lishers, and intermediate school districts. No significance at the P < .05 level was found for assistance from school librarians outside the district, the local public library or public library system, the state library or media association, the state teachers organization, the state department of edu- cation/public instruction, or national organizations. Challenge Initiator The source or initiator of the challenge was found to be significantly related to the outcome of the challenge. Complaints from district admin- istrators or principals were more likely to result in removal than others. Complaints from parents were more likely to result in retention and less likely to result in restrictions than others (see table 10). Characteristics of School Librarians When data on characteristics of the school librarian were examined, none of the variables were found to be significantly related to outcome except librarians' racial background. Thus, there were no significant differences related to years of classroom teaching, length of service as a librarian, formal education, gender, age, or sense of pressure in the selection of materials. Nonwhite librarians reported fewer retentions and more restrictions when compared with white librarians: x2 (df = 2, N = 606) = 15.21902, P < .05. Further analysis of librarians' characteristics focused on psychological measures of locus of control, dogmatism, and self-esteem. Psychological statements in the questionnaire were drawn primarily from validated measures reported in the literature [27]. Selection of validated state- ments for inclusion in the section on perspectives was based on the tested reliability of the statements, with statements showing highest reli- ability being more likely to be selected. An additional factor was the response of pretest respondents. In two instances, the pretest resulted in the alteration of validated statements to reflect more up-to-date, non- sexist language. For example, the locus of control statement, "This world is run by the few people in power and there is not much the little guy can do about it," was changed to read, "This world is run by the few people in power and there is not much the ordinary person can do

I also developed, tested, and used a few additional statements that were specific to school librarians. Locus of control was examined to determine the degree to which respondents believed in external control, that is, outcomes determined by others, or believed in internal control, that is, outcomes determined from within. Selected statements were taken from J. B. Rotter's Internal- External Locus of Control Scale [27, pp. 227-34]. Five statements, in- cluding one developed by me, were included in the questionnaire to measure gross estimates of internal/external locus of control. Dogmatism was examined to determine whether librarians were prone to accept blindly such authority as the immediate supervisor, the principal. It was also used to examine the degree to which librarians were inflexible in their belief systems. Statements were selected from the short dogmatism scale of V. Troldahl and F. Powell, which reduces the length of the dogmatism scale of Milton Rokeach [27, pp. 433-36].
56 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY Six statements, including one developed by me, were included in the questionnaire to provide gross estimates of dogmatism. Measures of self-esteem were designed to gauge the librarian's feeling of self-worth. The self-esteem statements were selected from Morris Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Test [27, pp. 81-83]. Four statements, includ- ing one developed by me, were included in the questionnaire to measure gross estimates of self-esteem. All psychological measures were statements in which responses ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). Tables 11-13 provide frequency and percentage responses for the psychological mea- sures based on all librarians reporting challenges, along with means and standard deviations. Several statistical tests were performed on selected data from the questionnaire including t-tests, correlation coefficients, and Cronbach's Alpha.7 For purposes of testing, the scale of locus of control statements that measured internal locus of control was revised so that coding for internal and external locus of control was consistent. The results of correlation coefficients and overall alpha value were examined to deter- mine whether data from some statements should be deleted from the analysis. For example, statements whose removal resulted in a higher alpha for the set were considered for removal. Also, statements with a correlation coefficient of less than .4000 were studied carefully and considered for removal. As a result of the examination, statement num- ber 70 was deleted from the analysis. Table 14 shows item-to-total corre- lation coefficients and alpha levels for the psychological statements re- sulting after the deletion. In terms of external locus of control, librarians did not feel they lacked influence over what happened to them, feel powerless in affect- ing the outcome of complaints to library media center materials, or feel that there was nothing the ordinary person could do. In terms of inter- nal locus of control, respondents showed no clear pattern of agreement as to whether they believed chance or luck played an important role in their lives. Respondents agreed that getting people to do the right thing depended upon ability. 7. The most common use of the t-statistic is to test the probability that a parameter value is statistically different from 0 (that is, what is the likelihood that the effect that the parameter is measuring is "real"). For this purpose, the t-statistic is calculated simply as the ratio of the parameter estimate to its standard error, and the P value associated with the statistic is the probability that the parameter is equal to 0. Correlation coeffi- cients measure the agreement between two items. A value of 1 indicates perfect agree- ment (they include the same information), and a value of 0 that they have no informa- tion in common. Negative values, like positive values, indicate amount of agreement, but the values of one item tend to increase when values of the second item decrease.
CHALLENGES TO LIBRARY MATERIALS 57 In terms of dogmatism, in most instances respondents disagreed with statements that supported authority roles. They did not feel that librari- ans should adhere to requests of the principal without question, did not believe that there was only one correct philosophy in the world, and did not agree that there was a need to rely on leaders or experts who could be trusted. Respondents did not feel there are only two kinds of people in the world: those for the truth and those against the truth. They did not agree that most people just do not know what is good for them. Respondents showed no clear pattern concerning whether it was upset- ting when people stubbornly refused to admit that they were wrong. In terms of self-esteem, respondents agreed that they have a number of good qualities, that they take a positive attitude toward themselves, and that, on the whole, they are satisfied with themselves. Of primary concern to the researcher was the question of whether differences among the respondents in their perceptions were signifi- cantly related to whether challenged materials were retained, restricted, or removed. Analyses of variance were used to determine whether there were significant differences in responses by outcome to challenged ma- terial. Data from some statements that measured dogmatism and locus of control showed significance according to the outcome of challenges to material. There were no findings of significant differences for the self-esteem variable. When the outcome was retention, the degree of internal locus of con- trol was higher and librarians were less likely to feel a sense of power- lessness (see table 15). Thus, in terms of locus of control as listed in statements 54, 68, and 76, librarians who reported the retention of chal- lenged material were less likely to agree that librarians are really power- less in affecting the outcome of materials than those who had material removed or restricted. Those who reported retention were less likely than those who reported removal to believe that the world is run by the few people in power and there is not much the ordinary person can do about it. Librarians who reported retention were less likely to agree that chance or luck plays an important role in their lives than those who reported removal. Data from statements 46 and 50 did not show signifi- cance according to outcome. When the outcome was retention, respondents were less dogmatic and less rigid in their absolute acceptance of the principal's authority (see table 16). Thus, in terms of dogmatism as listed in statements 45, 57, and 75, those who reported retention were less likely than those who reported removal or restriction to agree that the librarian should adhere Cronbach's alpha is a measure of agreement among several items. The scales and meanings for them parallel those of the correlation coefficient.

They were also less likely than this group to feel that the only way we can know what is going on is to rely on leaders or experts who can be trusted. Those who reported retention were less likely than those reporting removal to indicate that they found it upsetting when people stubbornly refuse to admit that they are wrong. Statements 49, 58, and 66 did not show significant difference by outcome. In summary, analysis of data from statements focusing on locus of control and dogmatism by librarians indicated that perceptions of a higher degree of internal locus of control and lower feelings of dogma- tism were associated with the outcome of retention. The only psycholog- ically measured variable in which statistical significance according to outcome was not found was self-esteem. Regardless of outcome, respon- dents indicated a high level of self-esteem when compared to the other psychological measures. Complaint Background Complaint background examines whether there was active support for either retention or removal of materials. It also examines whether the challenge was oral or written. The latter category includes oral chal- lenges that were later submitted in writing. Both complaint support and form of challenge are discussed below.

Support for retention or removal.-Support for the retention or removal of material was found to be significantly related to the outcome to the challenge. Where there was active support for retention, challenged material was more likely to be retained and less likely to be restricted or removed. In a similar way, where there was active support for removal, material was more likely to be removed. Material was also more likely to be restricted than retained (see table 17). Form of complaint.-Reported challenges were examined to see whether the outcome varied depending on whether the complaint was oral or written. Most complaints were oral. Outcome was significantly related to form of complaint. Challenges that were presented orally were more likely to result in removal than challenges that were written (see table 18). Logistic Regression Analysis The previous section, "Findings," was concerned with the identification of independent variables that, when compared to the dependent vari- able (outcome), were individually found to be statistically significant. Many of the independent variables were found to influence the outcome of a challenge. While this information is valuable, it only partially an- swers the question, "What variables influence the outcome to challenges of materials in secondary school libraries?" Because some of these effects will be interrelated, it is important to analyze the relationship of each independent variable in the presence of all others. Additional statistical

Because of the nature of the variables-which were a discrete depen- dent variable and continuous or discrete independent variables-logistic regression analysis was selected as the statistical technique appropriate for discovering which variables were most important in predicting the retention of materials.8 Logistic regression is a statistical technique that estimates the probabil- ity of an event's occurrence given information about the environment surrounding that event (see [28] for more information). In this test, the event was defined as the retention of material, compared to the nonretention of material. For this analysis, restriction and removal were grouped. Retention, as defined in this study, means that material re- mains on open shelves and is readily accessible to the user. Anything less than free access, whether material is restricted or removed, was categorized as nonretention.9 The independent variables were grouped and recoded where neces- sary, based in part on question format and frequency of response. Prin- cipal components analysis was used to define new variables that sum- 8. Logistic regression is a technique that determines the probability of an outcome with two levels. Ordinary regression is inappropriate here since outcome is on a categorical rather than a continuous scale. 9. Note the definition of "censorship," adopted by the American Library Association's Intellectual Freedom Committee in 1987: a change in the access status of material, made by a governing authority or its representatives. Such changes include: exclusion, restriction, removal, or age/grade level changes, where the intent is to restrict access.

Only cases that had no missing values for all variables were used in the logistic regression. There were 487 or 80.4 percent of responses that were appropriate for the regression. The sign of the logistic coeffi- cient in table 19 shows the direction of the significance. Positive logistic coefficients indicate the probability of nonretention, and negative coef- ficients indicate the probability of retention. Thus, the logistic regression suggests that (1) the most important fac- tors in influencing retention are a written board-approved policy and internal and external support for retention; and (2) the most important variables in influencing nonretention are the principal as initiator of the challenge, the librarian's willingness to follow directives without ques- tion, or the librarian's commitment to a closed belief system and support for removal. Thus, while the logistic regression generally supports the conceptual model tested in this study, it shows the path to outcomes to be more specific. Discussion The following discussion focuses on the major intellectual freedom stud- ies in library and information science consulted in the development of 10. Principal components analysis uses correlations among individual questions to create a smaller number of scales that contain the majority of information in these questions. The components can be given titles after review of the particular questions they include.
66 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY the model, as well as other supportive library and information science reports and studies. The discussion also provides a written summary of the model as revised, including the major classes of variables, and sug- gests areas of future research. Materials Selection Policy Several studies focusing on the outcome of challenges have shown a positive relationship between the existence and use of the materials se- lection policy, and the retention of challenged materials in the collection. These studies include those of Fiske [2], Woodworth [8], Wisconsin De- partment of Public Instruction [9, 10, 11], Limiting What Students Shall Read [12], and Bracy [13]. The findings of the present study support this research. More than two-thirds of the respondents reported having a written board-approved policy. It was found that these policies re- sulted in the retention of materials more than other types of policies or no policy. It was also found that when the policy was followed during a challenge, material had a greater likelihood of retention. Of all variables examined, use of a policy is the subject of the most research and is found most consistently to predict retention. School Environment Studies by Fiske [2], Farley [3], and Busha [4] all include a focus on the influence of the administrator on challenges. The research suggests that the influence of the principal relates to challenge outcomes. The study reported here supports the influence of the principal in the retention and the removal of materials. The study shows that, when the principal initiates a challenge, material is likely to be removed, and when the principal supports the librarian during a challenge, material is likely to be retained. A similar relationship exists when teachers provide support during a challenge. Pope [6] found a positive relationship between school size and reten- tion. This study supports that finding. Materials were retained less and removed more in schools with an enrollment below 500. They were retained more in schools of over 1,500. Community Environment Fiske [2] suggested the hypothesis that press support from the local media could be influential in affecting outcome. Reports such as that of the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction [9, 10, 11] and Limiting What Students Shall Read [12] found very little coverage by local media. This study, like the two latter, found that few challenges were known outside the school and did not find that local media significantly affected outcome.
CHALLENGES TO LIBRARY MATERIALS 67 Busha [4] found a positive relationship between community size and public librarians' intolerance of censorship. This national study found no overall significant differences. Although not dealt with comprehensively in previous library and in- formation science research, support during a challenge was found to make a difference in outcome in this study. The great majority of librari- ans in this study neither sought nor received assistance outside the dis- trict. Those who did, however, reported a higher rate of retention and a lower rate of removal than those who did not. Challenge Initiator Studies by Fiske [2], Woodworth [8], Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction [9,10,11], and Jenkinson [15] generally found that com- plaints initiated by those outside the district (that is, those besides district staff, such as parents) resulted in retention more than those inside the district (such as teachers and administrators). This study confirmed the finding. Complaints from district administrators or principals usually resulted in removal, while complaints from parents usually resulted in retention. Characteristics of School Librarians Characteristics of librarians relating to outcome differed from findings of most earlier research studies used in the development of the model. This study found no statistically significant outcome differences based on years of teaching, length of service as a librarian, formal education, gender, age, or sense of self-esteem. Significant differences were found according to racial background, and psychological measures of locus of control and dogmatism. Fiske [2] and Farley [3] found positive relationships between restric- tiveness and length of service, while Serebnick's analysis [7] of intellec- tual freedom research found varied results. Fiske found low estimates of self-worth among school librarians. Busha [4], England [5], and Pope [6] found the librarian's age to be related to restrictiveness, although, again, research findings are not consistent with some other studies as discussed by Serebnick. Fiske [2], Busha [4], and Pope [6] found a posi- tive relationship between the extent of formal education and the least restrictive library environment. Locus of control has not been a major focus of previous studies in library and information science. Behavioral science research summarized by Doob [18] indicates that persons' beliefs affect their actions. In terms of dogmatism, research by Fiske [2], Farley [3], Busha [4], and especially summaries of Doob [18], suggested that the perceived power and authority of individuals could have a profound
68 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY effect on roles assumed by librarians. Intellectual freedom studies of the past have not focused on librarians' racial background. Complaint Background Complaint background was added as a category to the model after ana- lyzing the study's results. Neither form of complaint (oral or written) nor support for removal or retention of materials received sufficient focus in previous library and information science research to suggest them as major variables. This study found that written complaints and active support for retention contributed to retention. Summary of Model Results of this national study have confirmed, refuted, and added vari- ables that have been thought to influence whether challenged library materials are retained, restricted, or removed. The study confirms that the issues involved are complex and suggests the following variables associated with the outcome of retention (asterisks indicate variables also supported by the logistic regression analysis): *District selection policy *a. Existence *b. Use during a challenge process *School environment a. Support of school principal during challenge b. Support of teachers during challenge *c. Overall internal support received by librarian during challenge d. Size of school (that is, larger schools) *Community environment *a. Support librarian receives during challenge from outside the school Initiator of challenge a. Parents b. Those generally outside school environment Librarian's characteristics a. Internal locus of control b. Low degree of dogmatism *Complaint background a. Written complaint *b. Active support for retention The findings of this study offer opportunities for a systematic direc- tion in the continued study of selected variables. Several additional areas of study can be identified based on existing data. The research results focus on the importance of the school environ- ment, including the principal and teachers. The present data can be
CHALLENGES TO LIBRARY MATERIALS 69 examined from these perspectives, focusing, for example, on challenges to materials in which the principal or the teacher is the initiator. Are the subjects focused on by principal(s) or teachers during the challenge different from those focused on by others? To what extent is the policy followed when the principal or teachers initiate the challenge? Although few challenges were made known outside the school envi- ronment, those covered by local media should be studied as a group. Far too little is known about the influence of local media on challenges to school library materials. The psychological factors of dogmatism and locus of control need to be more carefully examined. A beginning examination should include the relationships among librarians' demographic and professional back- ground variables and those measuring dogmatism and locus of control. Two areas of complaint background need further analysis. The ques- tionnaire data provide information on materials that were challenged. In most instances, a title was challenged only once. However, study of selected titles and the challenge process involved may provide insights into the nature of titles challenged more than once. The second area of further study is by form of complaint. Oral and written challenges should be separated and studied in detail to provide more insight into their specific natures. In addition, the relationships between form of complaint and librarians' measures of self-esteem, locus of control, and dogmatism can be examined. Finally, the findings of this study suggest the need for continued re- search beyond this study. The relationship of the librarian to the princi- pal should continue to be examined, along with the effect of the subordi- nate role of the librarian in a hierarchical structure. This includes further examination of the librarian's attitude toward authority, sense of dogmatism and locus of control, and level of self-esteem. Research in education, particularly research on effective schools, should be exam- ined in terms of relationships within the school, including those with teachers as well as with principals, and responses to challenges. The importance of internal and external support to the librarian dur- ing a challenge was a major finding of the study. Additional research could focus on support outside the district. Traditional sources of sup- port, for example, were found to be less effective than other outside support. The nature of effective support should be among the areas receiving further consideration. The study reported here focused on challenges to library materials in public secondary schools and should be replicated. Future studies may also include a focus on challenges to materials at the elementary level. Finally, as a major access concern, long-term, rather than short-term, examination of challenges to materials seems warranted.
