COMPARISON OF THE PUBLISHING PATTERNS BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN Ph.D.s IN LIBRARIANSHIP Christine A. Korytnykl Previous research examining librarians' publishing patterns has established the significance of published research for personal advancement. Studies have found, however, that in comparison with male librarians, female librarians tend to publish in disproportionately small numbers. One rationale offered for this discrepancy is that men receive the Ph.D. more frequently than do women (doctorate-holding librarians have been isolated as the most prolific writers). This study tests the hypothesis that men and women exhibit similar publishing patterns if education is held constant at the doctoral level. The population studied is limited to a random sample of library science Ph.D.s who received their degrees between 1969 and 1979. A list of each person's publications was compiled for the five-year period following receipt of the Ph.D. The citations are classified by gender, occupation, and type of publication and authorship. On the basis of this study, the hypothesis that men and women will exhibit similar publishing patterns cannot be rejected. The difference in the number of cita- tions per person for equal numbers of men and women is insignificant. Differ- ences between men and women when comparing type of publication, type of authorship, or quality of articles are also insignificant. There is, however, a significant difference between the number of unpublished women and the number of unpublished men; almost three times more women than men have no citations listed in Library Literature. The hypothesis can be rejected when compar- ing male and female educators. The difference between mean number of cita- tions per person as well as the difference between nonpublishing male and female educators is highly significant. Male educators publish almost twice as many works as do women. Female educators are almost six times as likely as male educators to have published nothing.

COMPARISON OF PUBLISHING PATTERNS 53 women, particularly when comparing measures of success: salary, posi- tion, prestige. Equally disturbing are studies that demonstrate women's relatively low productivity; for example, by comparison with male librar- ians, female librarians tend to publish in disproportionately small num- bers. Although many variables may be responsible for this discrepancy, little research has been conducted to determine the exact factors that inhibit or encourage publishing among librarians. Publication patterns of librarians require examination because studies have shown that high publication rates are correlated with advancement in the field and prestige among colleagues. These studies also indicate that male librarians hold more high-level administrative posts, command larger salaries, and enjoy more status than female librarians. One partial explanation is that men publish a notably larger amount than women. This may occur because the most prolific writers are those who hold the doctorate degree, and until 1976-77, more men than women were receiving Ph.D.s in librarianship [1, p. 1612]. Female librarians, there- fore, are less prepared to do research and publish. If gender difference in education is the sole or major reason for gender difference in the number of publications, then the publishing difference should disap- pear or be minimized if education is held constant at the Ph.D. The major hypothesis of this study is that when publishing histories of men and women holding library school doctorates are examined, they will be similar with regard to quantity and type. Previous Research Harvey was the first to isolate publishing as a characteristic of highly placed librarians. He correlated research with advancement and pres- tige; upwardly mobile librarians were the most likely to have published books and articles. Eighty percent of academic library heads and 50 percent of public library heads had published. In contrast, 16 percent of academic librarians and 1 percent of public librarians holding low-level positions had published. Harvey discovered, further, that most of the top positions were held by prolific authors [2, p. 146]. Masse Bloomfield's 1966 study was the first to describe both the amount published in librarianship and the author's characteristics. Ex- amining the number of citations per person in the 1964 volume of Library Literature, he found that the average library science Ph.D. pub- lished 5.1 items prior to completion of the doctorate, one item per year thereafter, and 18.6 items total. The median number of publications was eight. All citations, regardless of type or authorship, were assumed to have equal value. Gender of author was not taken into consideration.
54 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY Journal articles were the most popular format of expression, and mono- graphs the least popular, although the Ph.D.s averaged more than one book each. Bloomfield concluded that the number of a librarian's publi- cations increased with possession of the doctorate [3, pp. 109, 111-12]. In 1979, Bloomfield updated his previous study of publishing charac- teristics of librarians, again using Library Literature as a source for cita- tions and assigning equal value to each citation. Doctorate holders con- tinued to be the most prolific writers among librarians. In comparison with the earlier group, post-1966 Ph.D.s published only 3.1 items prior to attainment of the doctorate with the median number of five items after receiving the degree. This lower value can be attributed to the shorter time span of the second study. Bloomfield found that both the 1966 and the 1979 groups of library science doctoral candidates tended to be mature, experienced publishers and concluded that "somehow the selection of doctoral candidates separates those who write from those who do not. Nearly everyone, 99 percent or more of the doctorates, produced an item that was cited in Library Literature." Bloomfield further related writing to professional achievement. He maintained that there was a "high chance that the person who is a top-ranking administrator or educator will write or conduct research" [4, p. 34]. Watson described research and publishing as "certainly one of the most important. . . indexes for evaluating librarians' accomplishments" [5, p. 375]. Her sample included only librarians from the ten largest public and private academic libraries that maintain composite publica- tion lists for staff members. With the exception of in-house publications, all other types of citations were tabulated. Three variables affecting publication patterns were identified. The first was professional maturity; librarians who have been practicing the longest tend to have the largest number of publications. The second was job description. Watson found a high correlation between publishing and each of the following charac- teristics: administrative responsibility, subject specialization, technical expertise. The third factor was education. Sixty percent of librarian- authors have a second master's, a doctorate, or another higher degree. The Olsgaard study first attempted to identify a bias in publication trends on the basis of the author's sex, occupation, or geographic loca- tion. Ten years of author statistics from publications in College and Research Libraries (CRL), Library Journal (LJ), Library Quarterly (LQ), Li- brary Trends (LT), and RQ were compared to normal distribution figures for the entire population of librarians and library school faculty mem- bers. These journals were chosen because they met certain criteria estab- lished by the researchers and they represent a broad base of interests. Although women constitute 84 percent of the population of librarians, the highest percentage of females among librarian authors was 41.3
COMPARISON OF PUBLISHING PATTERNS 55 percent in RQ and the lowest percentage was 30.5 percent in CRL. Among library school faculty, women make up 40.8 percent of the population, yet were represented at the highest percent among faculty authors in RQ (33.9 percent) and at the lowest percent in CRL (12.5 percent). Among academic librarians, women make up 61.5 percent of the population, yet are, at best, 39.6 percent of the academic librarian authors in CRL and at worst, 24.7 percent of those in LT. The Olsgaards describe the typical author of a library science article as a male academic librarian from the northeast [6, pp. 49-53]. Adamson and Zamora tested the Olsgaard profile in a study of publi- cations of interest to special librarians to discover if a similar imbalance existed. The results of this study indicate that although the incidence of women among special librarians is 75.9 percent, only 43.7 percent of publishers in special library journals are women while 56.3 percent are men [7, pp. 235-41]. No similar study analyzing the gender of authors in journals read by school and public librarians could be located. Since women also dominate these areas of librarianship, it would be inter- esting to discover who conducts research and publishes in journals such as School Library Journal and Public Library Quarterly. Estabrook and Heim described the results of a study conducted by the Committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship (COWSL). This study analyzed factors and trends that influence the differences in status between the sexes, using ALA members as the test population. COWSL found that 75.8 percent of ALA members are women and 24.1 percent are men. Among the 95.5 percent of ALA members who hold the M.L.S., 4.2 percent of women also have Ph.D.s and 19.5 percent of men have Ph.D.s. Of the doctorate-holders, 5.2 percent of the women and 17.1 percent of the men have written books, 24.9 percent of the women and 52.5 percent of the men have written articles, and 18.8 percent of the women and 35.7 percent of the men have written book reviews. The COWSL study concluded that variation can be found between men and women when comparing such characteristics as participation, compensa- tion, and status, as well as publishing patterns and education, although it was beyond the scope of the study to infer causal relationships [8, p. 65]. Heim identified librarianship as a field that practices intraoccupa- tional segregation, or dual career patterns for men and women. Men engage in academic librarianship and hold administrative posts three times more often than women. Female librarians dominate school and children's librarianship and are clustered at low-level positions. Heim's statistics also indicate that women's median salary is consistently lower than men's, and that, as already noted, only since academic year 1976- 77 have women earned Ph.D.s in the same numbers as men [9, pp. 8-11].
56 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY Swisher and Du Mont questioned why women did not obtain top administrative posts. Sex was one of the variables examined as were external factors such as selective recruitment, general stereotypes, and lack of mentors. They found two primary reasons for women's lack of success. First, women have a lower educational level than men. Sixty-six percent of library science Ph.D.s are men, while only 34 percent are women. Second, men and women publish at different rates. The real discrepancy was in article production: 44.2 percent of men but only 27 percent of women were authors of articles [10, pp. 143-44]. Previous research examining librarians' publishing patterns has estab- lished a relationship between publication and professional advancement. Analysis of the characteristics of publishing librarians has determined that men publish more than women. These studies have also isolated education as an important indicator of a librarian's tendency to publish. The present study, however, will compare an equal number of men and women Ph.D.s to determine the extent to which education is correlated with publication. If the hypothesis is rejected, and it is proven that men and women who have the same educational level continue to exhibit different levels of publishing, then other variables affecting publishing must be examined by future investigators. If the hypothesis is found to be correct, and men and women Ph.D.s show similar publishing output, then it can be predicted that as women continue to earn doctorates in equal or greater numbers, publishing differences will be reduced. Methodology This comparison of the effect of education on the publishing patterns of men and women is limited to a sample drawn from the population of library science Ph.D.s. People holding this degree account for 60 percent of all authors of the literature of library science, perhaps because doc- torate-level training provides intensive preparation for research. This population is also assumed to be relatively homogeneous in terms of motivation and commitment to the field. A list of people who completed their library science Ph.D.s between 1969 and 1979 was generated using American Doctoral Dissertations. This source lists all dissertations accepted by American and Canadian univer- sities. Each entry was numbered, and a random sample of thirty men and thirty women was drawn. When the sex of a person could not be determined from the name, the institution granting the degree was contacted. Any entry whose sex still could not be determined was dis- carded. A list of each entry's publications for the five-year period following
COMPARISON OF PUBLISHING PATTERNS 57 receipt of the Ph.D. was compiled using Library Literature. This time period was chosen for convenience and consistency as well as with the assumption that, as educators strive for tenure, these years tend to be the most productive. Each publication was classified by author (sole, joint, editor/compiler) and format (monograph, chapter, article, paper, pamphlet). Book re- views and letters to the editor were eliminated because of the fluctua- tions of quality, length, and purpose among individual items. A distinc- tion was made between articles that are refereed and those that are not. Mary Ann Bowman's Library and Information Science Journals and Serials: An Analytical Guide [1 ] was used to determine how each manuscript had been selected. Bowman determined the editorial policy of each journal by surveying the journal editors. A category was also established for journals whose editorial policy was not specified. Each person in the sample was classified into one of two employment categories: primarily educator (member of a library school faculty) or primarily professional (practicing librarian). Adjunct faculty members were not included in the group of educators; it is assumed their primary responsibilities lie with their professional positions. The number of citations in each publication category was tabulated for men and women and within each gender group for educators and practitioners. The groups were then compared in order to determine the influence of gender and employment on a librarian's publishing record. The Study Description of Population The sample used in this study was drawn from the list of library science Ph.D.s listed in the standard dissertation abstracting source [12-13] between the academic years of 1968/69-1978/79. The sixty-member sample represents just under 10 percent of the entire population of 652 graduates (table 1). Confirming the findings of Heim [9] and Swisher and Du Mont [10], the majority of Ph.D.s in this population are men (52.8 percent). Women constitute 39.9 percent of the population, and those whose gender could not be determined because of foreign or ambiguous names, 7.4 percent. The only year in which women graduates predominated was 1977-78. A large percentage of uncertain names (15 percent) in that year, how- ever, may have influenced the results. The gap between the number of men and women Ph.D.s seems to be closing. In sheer numbers, the amount of women completing Ph.D.s is increasing. To date, the largest number of women received the doctorate in 1978-79. Prior to 1976-77,

The amount of men, however, fluctuates without any steady increase; 1972-73 is their strongest year. Since Ph.D.s are the most prolific published authors among librarians, the greater number of male authors can probably be explained by the greater number of men holding the Ph.D. A citation tally of an equal number of doctorate-holding men and women librarians neutralizes the factor of education and suggests whether it or other factors are responsi- ble for women's low publication rate. Quantitative Analysis The number of citations to publications under each name chosen for the sample is tabulated and presented in table 2. For the purpose of tabulat- ing a gross publication total, each citation was assigned equal value and counted once. Citation of the Ph.D. dissertation was excluded from the total unless it was published as a book, an article, or a chapter. Men had a total of eighty-five citations, with an average per person of 2.8 and a median of two. The total citations for women were sixty-one, with an average per person of two and a median of one. A t-test revealed the difference in the means for men and women not to be significant (t = 1.095). These calculations indicate that in general, Ph.D.s in librarianship publish very little in the first five years after receipt of the degree; 16.7 percent of the men and 43.3 percent of the women have no citations listed in Library Literature. This finding contradicts the assumption that

The dif- ference between men and women who have no publications is confirmed by a t-test, which shows that the difference is highly significant (t = 5). Although it is beyond the scope of this study to determine exact causes, several explanations are possible. One explanation may lie with the type of training students receive at the doctoral level. Library schools prepare graduates for two possible professions: top-level administration or teaching on library school facul- ties. This dual goal may not adequately socialize students in scholarship. Thompson identified the harshest criticism of library schools as being "the charge that the vocational content of most library school curricula overshadowed the intellectual" [14, p. 95]. Many students, however, may not be interested in conducting research and publishing; they receive doctorates in order to advance within library hierarchies. The large number of nonpublished women in the sample may be attributed to several factors. First is limitation in the study's design. Name changes not recorded in Library Literature would lower the totals for women. This study's limited time frame does not allow for tempo- rary absences from the profession or for slower rates of professional maturation. Women traditionally are subject to heavier familial obliga- tions and may be more likely to encounter limitations on the time they can devote to their careers. Another explanation may be overwhelming
60 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY external obstacles: discriminatory hiring practices, difficulty in obtaining research funds, editorial bias, lack of encouragement. Failure to gain the academic rewards and recognition men normally achieve, such as tenure and promotions, may discourage women from publishing. For instance, statistics gathered by the Association for Library and Information Sci- ence Education reveal that in 1984-85, women held 43 percent of the full-time faculty positions in ALA-accredited library schools but only 36 percent of the associate professorships, 32 percent of the full professor- ships, 33 percent of the deanships [15, p. F-27], and 36 percent of the tenured appointments [15, p. F-36]. At all ranks, women's mean and median salaries were substantially lower than men's. On the other hand, considerably lower percentages of women than men held earned docto- rates [15, p. F-32]-a difference that may soon disappear. Three possible explanations for women's lack of publications are explored in this study. The first is type of publication. Authorship of longer, more substantial, works, such as monographs, take more time and energy and may, therefore, lower the number of citations for an individual. The second possibility is type of employment. An adminis- trator's responsibilities may prevent the publication of as many works as a library school faculty member, who is required to publish in order to earn tenure and usually has a more flexible schedule. The third reason may lie with the quality of publications. An article in a refereed journal is generally more scholarly in nature and requires more research than an article published by a nonrefereed journal. Although women publish quantitatively fewer articles than men, the quality of women's articles may be higher. Type of Publication and Authorship To determine which type of publication is most commonly written by men and by women, five categories were identified: monograph, article, chapter, occasional paper, and pamphlet. The contrast between the large number of citations to articles and the small number of citations to all other publication categories reflects the results Bloomfield [3] first described. Men, however, still had more citations in every category with the exception of pamphlets. This breakdown also highlights a general lack of citations to monographs by both men and women. The differ- ence between Bloomfield's findings and the results of this study can probably be explained by the difference in time frames. Bloomfield studied more than thirty years of data; this study is limited to a ten-year period. Although both men and women had an equal number of cita- tions to monographs, two of the women's citations were to jointly edited directories. Further research is needed to determine exact reasons for this gap in the literature. Are funds to support the writing of longer
COMPARISON OF PUBLISHING PATTERNS 61 works of scholarship unavailable to women? Do their other professional obligations take precedence over the writing of monographs? Type of authorship is broken down into four categories: sole author, sole editor/compiler, joint author, joint editor/compiler. The results show that most authors work individually rather than on a team. Men, however, tend to publish articles with colleagues at three times the rate of women. It is in the category of the jointly authored article that men excel, boosting their quantitative output above women's level. This trend suggests that women suffer from professional isolation; they may not be included as often on research teams or communicate as effectively with colleagues through professional networks. Further investigation is needed to determine whether men copublish exclusively with other men or with women as well. A t-test revealed the difference between the mean number of jointly authored works between men and women to be insignificant (t = .3). The difference between the number of men and the number of women who are authors of jointly published articles is also insignificant (t = .47). Future researchers need to study profes- sional collegiality and its effect on professional advancement. Type of Employment Examination of the career paths women choose may provide another explanation for the lower publishing rates of women [5]. The ALA Membership Directory and the directory of library school faculty members compiled annually by the Association of American Library Schools (now the Association for Library and Information Science) were consulted to find the job title that each member of the sample had in the third year after completion of the Ph.D. Based on these titles, each person was classified as an educator (member of a library school faculty) or as a professional (practicing librarian or administrator whose primary re- sponsibilities exclude teaching). Five men and three women were not listed in either directory and were, therefore, excluded from this part of the study. It is expected that educators are under more pressure to publish, particularly those who have just begun their academic careers and are trying to become tenured. If more men tend to become educa- tors and more women become professionals, then men would have more citations. The comparison of male educators with female educators, however, discounts the above hypothesis (tables 3 and 4). Educators who are male published 4.15 items per person, with a median of four. Women av- eraged only 1.84 items; their median is one. A t-test showed the differ- ence in the mean numbers of publications of men and women educators to be significant; the confidence interval was approximately 97 percent (t = 2.67). In addition, women educators with no citations (44 percent)

COMPARISON OF PUBLISHING PATTERNS 63 far outnumber the nonpublished men (7.7 percent); a t-test revealed this difference to be highly significant (t = 4.8). Although this study did not survey those sampled to determine moti- vations for publishing, several explanations are possible for the discrep- ancy in citation totals. The first regards type of institution. Women may prefer to work at schools that emphasize teaching at the expense of research. A second reason may be inequality in the distribution of job responsibility. Heavy teaching or advising loads and administrative duties would prevent women from conducting research. A third factor may be that women are discouraged from perceiving library school faculty positions as permanent. Hiring for tenure-track positions may be biased in favor of men, or women may be more likely to be denied tenure. In either case, lack of incentive for publishing would stifle the motivation to publish. Male professionals constitute the only group of men that publishes at a slightly lower rate than the same category of women. These men average 2.25 citations per person, with a median of two. Women professionals, however, average 2.78 citations per person. Their median is only 1.84, indicating that some very prolific women boost the average. Results of a t-test show the difference in the mean number of citations between men and women professionals to be insignificant (t = .35). A t-test reveals the difference in the numbers of nonpublished men and women profession- als also to be insignificant (t = .89). The low median number of citations for professional women consti- tutes further evidence of professional segregation. If women are dis- couraged from pursuing careers as library school educators, they may instead choose professional positions despite their interests in research and their abilities to publish. Consequently, the group of professional women will contain exceptional members whose high rate of publication skews the mean toward a high value. Women may also feel that in order to compete successfully for top-level administrative posts, their record of productivity must exceed that of their male colleagues. In addition, no professional woman has any jointly authored articles, which indicates that professional isolation among these women may be particularly severe. Quality of Publications A comparison of the quality of the articles written by library science Ph.D.s, using journal selection methods as a measure, reveals no differ- ence between men and women. Approximately one-third of all articles were published in refereed journals (table 5). A t-test showed no signifi- cant difference (t = .33); therefore, further research is necessary to determine whether a real difference does exist in the quality of articles

Professional women, however, are more inclined than men to publish in journals such as Administrative Science Quarterly and Children Today, which are indexed in Library Literature although their primary subject is not library science. Conclusions On the basis of this study, the hypothesis that men and women will exhibit similar publishing patterns cannot be rejected. The difference in the number of citations per person for equal numbers of men and women is insignificant. Differences between men and women in type of publication, type of authorship, and quality of articles are also insignifi- cant. There is, however, a significant difference between the number of unpublished women and the number of unpublished men; almost three times more women than men are not cited in Library Literature. The hypothesis can be rejected when comparing men and women educators. The difference between mean number of citations per person as well as the difference between nonpublishing male and female educa- tors is highly significant. Men educators publish almost twice as many works as women; women educators are almost six times as likely as men educators to have published nothing. Further study of male and female educators must be conducted to determine whether men and women enter doctoral programs with simi- lar goals, as well as whether equal opportunities are available for those who complete the degree and aspire to careers as library school faculty members.
