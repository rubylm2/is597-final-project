BOOKS OF THE VIRGINIA DYNASTY WILLIAM D. HOULETTE economic and social system of Colonial Virginia nourished and I exalted men of great political ability and personal culture. From among these came four of the first five presidents of the United States, a group of eminent men known to the informed world as the "Virginia dynasty." George Washington received little for- mal education, but he developed a high regard for books and collected an exten- sive library during his lifetime. When thirteen or fourteen years of age, he was studying mathematics and reading an abbreviated version of Francis Hawkins' Youth's Behavior.' It was during the French and Indian War that his cor- respondence first disclosed information concerning his reading. In September, 1757, he wrote from Fort Loudon to Anthony Bacon and Company thanking them for a magazine he had received.2 A communication the following year to Mrs. George William Fairfax indicated that Washington had read Addison's Cato.3 After his marriage to Mrs. Martha Custis, Washington was appointed guardian of the Custis children and he was zealous in promoting their interest and welfare. His concern for education is portrayed by the fact that in 1759, the year of his marriage, he ordered from London "6 little books for childn begg. to Read."4 These books were included in an invoice of merchandise sent to Mount Vernon in Miarch, 1760, by Robert Cary and Company.5 The following year a par- cel of books was dispatched by the same London merchants for the use of John Parke Custis and "Patsy" Custis. This consignment included a Bible and a pray- er book for each child. These volumes were bound in Turkish leather and the children's names in gilt were on the in- side of the cover. There were twelve titles in this shipment, including Phaed- rus' Fables and Littleton's Latin and English Dictionary.6 In 1769, after John Parke Custis' education was undertaken by the Reverend Jonathan Boucher, a large number of books were ordered by Washington for the use of the young man. These included Cicero's Works in twen- ty volumes, Blackwell's Sacred Clas- sics, Hume's History of England, Ken- net's Roman Antiquities, and forty-four other titles, making a total of about seventy-five volumes in the shipment.7 In the meantime Washington was add- ing books to his own library. George Washington was a gentleman planter. He was greatly interested in agriculture and frequently ordered books on farming. Repeated attempts were made to secure a copy of Hale's Hus- bandry from Robert Cary and Company I Douglas S.

BOOKS OF THE VIRGINIA DYNASTY 227 but without success. Later he learned that the wrong title had been given and rectified this misinformation by order- ing, in 1760, "A Compleat Body of Hus- bandry compiled from the Original Pa- pers of the late Thomas Hale Esqr., enlargd from the Collection of others.. . together with Hartlibs Legacy of Hus- bandry."8 The previous year he had re- quested A New System of Agriculture or a Speedy Way to grow Rich, Longley's Book of Gardening, and Gibson's Diseases of Horses, to be sent from London.9 That these books were received is shown by the inventory of the library at Mount Vernon made some years later.10 Washington's attachment to the Ang- lican church, and his participation in local government, were indicated by his order, in 1771, of "A Prayer Book covd. with red Moroco, to be 7 Inchs. long 4' wide, and as thin as possible for the greater ease of caryg. in the Pocket," together with the newest edition of Rich- ard Burn's The Justice of Peace and Par- ish Otficer, in four volumes." For many years Washington was ac- tive in military affairs. During that time he became greatly interested in military science and tactics. Shortly after Brad- dock's defeat, the young Virginia officer wrote to England for Bland's Military Discipline, which he later recommended to the officers under his command.'2 Colonel Washington became acquainted with Count Turpin de Crisse's Essai sur l'art de la Guerre when he accompanied General Forbes to Fort Duquesne. An English translation of this work by Cap- tain Joseph Otway was obtained by Washington and was in the library at Mount Vernon.13 He continued his mili- tary studies and by the beginning of the Revolution was familiar with many of the works on military tactics. After ac- cepting the command of the American army, Washington wrote to Colonel Wil- liam Woodford of Virginia in November, 1775, stating: "The manual exercise, the evolutions and manoeuvres of a regi- ment, with other knowledge necessary to a soldier, you will acquire . . . from those authors, who have treated upon these subjects, among whom Bland (the newest edition) stands foremost; also an Essay on the Art of War; Instructions for Officers lately published at Philadel- phia; the Partisan; and others."114 The Instructions for O#icers was Thomas Simes's Military Guide for Young Offi- cers, which had been published in London in 1722 and was reprinted by Robert Aitken at Philadelphia in 1775.15 George Washington was also inter- ested in the importance of the periodical press in America. On June 25, 1788, he wrote to Mathew Carey: "I consider such easy vehicles of knowledge as more highly calculated than any other to pre- serve the liberty, stimulate the industry, and meliorate the morals of an enlight- ened and free people."'6 History stimulated Washington's in- terest; he purchased many volumes and encouraged writers in this field.

228 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY who had strongly sympathized with the revolting colonists, received encourage- ment from Mount Vernon when he was writing his History of the American Revo- lution in 1788.17 When the work was com- pleted in 1791, a complimentary set was forwarded to the first president of the United States."8 In 1798 Washington sent a letter to Jeremy Belknap, who was contemplating writing several vol- umes of American biography, offering his support to the project by pledging himself as a subscriber to the work.19 The many and long interruptions of Washington's private affairs by public service greatly disturbed his reading habits. It was not easy for him to enjoy leisure even upon his final retirement. His time was claimed by many duties following his long neglect of domestic matters. "I have not looked into a book since I came home," he wrote to Sec- retary of War McHenry in 1797, "nor shall I be able to do it until I have dis- charged my workmen, probably not be- fore the nights grow longer, when pos- sibly," he added with a touch of uncon- scious prophecy, "I may be looking in Doomsday-Book."20 At the time of his death in 1799 Wash- ington possessed a large collection of books, including a number of volumes from the library of Daniel Parke Custis. The Custis library consisted of over four hundred and fifty volumes which were partially divided between Washington and John Parke Custis after the marriage of the latter's mother to the owner of Mount Vernon.2' One evidence of Wash- ington's regard for his books was the fact that many of them were marked with bookplates.2 These bookplates were requested to be procured by Robert Adam who was going to England in 1771. Along with other merchandise, there was ordered "A Plate with my Arms engravd and 4 or 500 Copies struck."23 The Washington library contained over twelve hundred volumes of books and bound periodicals, together with a large number of charts and maps.24 The col- lection contained some literature and many works upon history and political affairs. It included Don Quixote, Swift's Works, Shakespeare's Works, Gibbon's Roman Empire, Ramsay's Revolution of South Carolina, Monroe's View of the Executive, and many others. Military treatises were conspicuous by their pres- ence, and in addition to the works cited heretofore it contained Vallance's Forti- fications, Muller's Artillery, and numer- ous other books upon army disciplime and tactics.5 The books of Washington were kept in eight cases in a south room used as a library at Mount Vernon. In his will he bequeathed "To my nephew Bushrod Washington ... all the papers in my pos- session which relate to my civil and mili- tary administration of the affairs of this Country:-I leave to him also such of my private papers as are worth preserv- 17 "Letters of the Reverend William Gordon," Massachusetts Historical Society Proceedings, LXIII (June, 1930), 546. 18 Ibid., p. 562. 19 Ford, The Writings of George Washington, XIV, 11-12. 2O Jared Sparks, The Writings of George Washing- ton (New York: Harper & Bros., 1847-48), Vol. XI, 203-4; Eugene E.

BOOKS OF THE VIRGINIA DYNASTY 229 ing:-and at the decease of my wife and before, if she is not inclined to retain them, I give and bequeath my library of Books and pamphlets of every kind."26 Bushrod Washington, a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, did not participate in the management of the estate during the survival of his uncle's widow.27 Upon the death of Mrs. Martha Washington in 1802, her books were bequeathed to her grandson George Washington Parke Custis.28 These books were evidently personally owned by Mrs. Washington, for shortly after her decease Justice Bushrod Washington took possession of the library and the estate of Mount Vernon devised to him by his famous uncle. In 1810, when an inventory of the estate was made, the library was appraised at $2,350.00.29 Washington's library was of considerable size, but another book collection of far more importance was located at Monti- cello, near Charlottesville, Virginia. Peter Jefferson, father of Thomas Jef- ferson, was a man of ability. He co- operated with Joshua Fry in preparing a map of Virginia. It received wide recog- nition, and a copy was used in making a French map of Virginia and Maryland in 1755 by Robert de Vaugondy, official "Geographer of the King of France."30 George Washington also possessed a copy of the Fry and Jefferson map as it was found in the Mount Vernon library at the time of his death. Jonathan Boucher, in a letter to England in 1767, recom- mended the "Map of Maryland & Vir- ginia by Fry & Jefferson ... as 'tis much ye Best."3' When Peter Jefferson died in 1757, he left a number of books, including Rapin's History of England, Ogilvie's Description of America, Anson's Voyage around the World, and several other works 32 Thomas Jefferson, the eldest son of Peter Jefferson, was bom in 1743 and received his early education in a school at Tuckahoe, Virginia. Later he attended Doublas' Latin School and matriculated at William and Mary College in 1760. He graduated in 1762 and the same year entered the office of George Wythe, where he devoted himself assiduously to the study of law.33 Jefferson evidently did not find it an enjoyable pastime as he wrote to John Page on Christmas, 1762, stating: "I do wish the Devil had old Coke, for I am sure I never was so tired of an old dull scoundrel in my life." This letter also revealed that the young law student was a classical scholar as he quoted both Latin and Greek phrases.34 The following year he again wrote to this friend lamenting that eye trouble made reading impossible for the time being.35 Another letter to Page in 1764 requested the use of The Statutes of Great Britain.36 Even as a young man Jefferson began assembling a library. By 1770 he had a collection of some importance, as he 26 Ford, The Writings of George Washington, XIV, 283. 27 Prussing, op. cit., p. 99. 28 Ibid., pp. 100, 390. 29 Ford, Inventory of the Contents of Mount Vernon, 1810, p. 28. a0 George A.

230 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY wrote to John Page: "My late loss may perhaps have reached you by this time; I mean the loss of my mother's house by fire, and in it of every paper I had in the world, and almost every book. On a reasonable estimate I calculate the cost of the books burned to have been ?200 sterling. Would to God it had been the money, then had it never cost me a sigh! To make the loss more sensible, it fell principally on my books of Common Law, of which I have but one left, at that time lent out." 37 Soon steps were taken to replace the loss. In 1771 Jeffer- son wrote to Thomas Adams, a Virginia merchant then residing in London, stat- ing that he had ordered books from Wal- ler and from Benson Pearson to the value of nearly ?90 sterling.38 An agreement was made between Jefferson and John Randolph in April, 1771, to the effect that if the former died first, Randolph was to receive books to the value of ?800 sterling, or cash to make up the deficien- cy if there were insufficient books. In re- turn Thomas Jefferson was to receive Randolph's violin and his music, or books to the value of ?60 sterling in lieu thereof if the violin was destroyed.39 This agreement was canceled in 1775 when Jefferson purchased the Randolph violin.40 Writing to Robert Skipwith from Monticello on August 3, 1771, con- cerning book selection, Jefferson stated: "I sat down with a design of executing your request to form a catalogue of books to the amount of about ?50 sterl. But could by no means satisfy myself with any partial choice I could make. Think- ing therefore it might be agreeable to you I have framed a general collection as I think you would wish and might in time find convenient to procure." He then proceeded to discuss the value of reading fiction and rejected the idea that anything could be useful but "Greek and Roman reading."'" After the beginning of the American Revolution, Jefferson was so active in contemporary affairs that he had little leisure for reading. This diversion was greatly missed, for he wrote in 1776 won- dering when he "should have time to look into books again."42 Books con- tinued to arrive from Europe for the library at Monticello in spite of the war, however, as Dr. Richard Price's Observa- tions of Civil Liberty was received a short time after the proclamation of the Dec- laration of Independence. Negotiations were also opened with the Reverend Samuel Henley of England, in 1778, for the purchase of that clergyman's books stored in Williamsburg if their sale was contemplated.43 The Reverend Mr. Hen- ley gladly accepted Jefferson's offer, fear- ing that the books would be lost or de- stroyed otherwise.44 In 1781 Jefferson resigned his office as governor of Virginia and retired to his beloved mountain, expressing the hope that he would not be obliged to leave his farm and his books again.4" It was there that the Marquis de Chastellux found him so comfortably situated when he 37 Ibid., I, 370. 38 Frederick Daniel, "Some Colonial and Revo- lutionary Letters," Harper's New Monthly Maga- zine, LXXXI (July, 1890), 205. 3 P.L.

BOOKS OF THE VIRGINIA DYNASTY 231 stopped at Monticello for a visit while on the way to see the natural bridge. The Marquis wrote of Jefferson's de- lightful home, of his library, and, above all, of the great charm and diversity of interest and learning of the man him- self.46 In 1781 Jefferson began writing his famous Notes on Virginia in reply to an inquiry sent out by the French min- istry for the purpose of gaining informa- tion concerning the condition of the sev- eral American states. This work was re- cast and supplemented. It was not until later, however, that the earnest entreat- ies of his friends in America and Europe finally persuaded Jefferson to offer the book for publication. A French transla- tion appeared in 1786, and an edition was published in English by John Stock- dale of London in 1787.47 The book was published in Philadelphia in 1788, and by 1801 the work had gone through nine American editions. A German transla- tion was published at Leipzig in 1789.48 After the death of Mrs. Jefferson in 1782, the care and education of his daughters was a great problem for the owner of Monticello. While attending the sessions of Congress, Jefferson placed his daughter Martha with a Mrs. Hop- kinson of Philadelphia. Frequent cor- respondence with the child guided her in her studies. She was advised to spend at least three hours daily reading English and French, three hours practicing mu- sic, and the remainder of the time danc- ing, drawing, and writing.49 When Jefferson was appointed Min- ister to the French Court, his contact with men of eminence in Europe stimu- lated his interest in books and scientific experiments. Corresponding with Charles Thompson in June, 1785, he explained the tragedy which befell a French bal- loonist who attempted to cross the Eng- lish Channel, when the balloon caught fire and both operators were killed.50 Jefferson not only purchased books for himself while in Paris, but he also searched the bookstalls for works of interest for his friends. Some of the books sent to America in 1785 were: four vol- umes of the BibliotheIque Physico-Oeconi- mique for Dr. Styles; a thirteen-volume work by Felice upon natural and munici- pal law for Edmund Randolph; and mis- cellaneous works for George Wythe, Mr. Page, and Peter Carr.5' His commissions were not limited to searching for books in Europe for American friends, but ex- tended to seeking the American book- sellers for French friends. On one occa- sion Buffon, the French naturalist, sought his assistance in procuring a pam- phlet on attraction and repulsion, writ- ten by Cadwallader Colden. Jefferson enlisted the aid of friends in searching Pennsylvania and New Jersey book mar- kets for a copy of this treatise, but no evidence survived showing that the quest was successful.52 David Ramsay's History of the Revolution of South Carolina was also popular in Europe. It was trans- lated into French and was also offered 46 The Marquis de Chastellux, Travels in North America, in the Years 1780,1781, and 1782 (London, 1787), II, 40-46. 47 P. L.

232 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY for sale in England, but Jefferson la- mented: "They are . . . . altering Dr. Ramsay's book in London in order to accomodate it to the English palate and pride. I hope this will not be done with- out the consent of the author & I do not believe that will be obtained."53 He also acted as literary critic for the Reverend William Gordon, who sent two volumes of his History of the American Revolution for Jefferson's inspection.54 While residing in France, Thomas Jefferson kept in close touch with af- fairs at home. In August, 1785, he wrote to his nephew Peter Carr outlining for him a course of reading. This was to be- gin with the works of the ancient his- torians Herodotus and Thucydides, fol- lowed by Roman history, modem his- tory, Greek and Latin poetry, philoso- phy, and the best works in English litera- ture, such as Milton's Paradise Lost and Shakespeare's Works. That this advice might be more easily followed, a number of books were ordered sent to young Carr from London." Books were also sent to the Reverend James Madison, president of William and Mary College, for his own personal reading and for the use of the students. A present of books sent by the King of France for the use of the college was acknowledged by the Reverend Mr. Madison in a letter to Jefferson dated April 10, 1785.56 Books and pamphlets were secured from different parts of Europe for the library at Monticello. Jean Fabbroni sent a treatise on agriculture from Flor- ence, Italy, in 1786, and wrote Jefferson in French begging him to accept the gift.57 From Spain came the Letters of Fernand Cortez and from Lyons, France, some French works for Jefferson's use.58 There is an account of Jefferson's enter- taining the Marquis de Lafayette and Governeur Morris at his home in Paris, where along with the consideration of the crisis in France there was also dis- cussion of a new book on commerce.59 After his return to America in 1789, books by European writers continued to be imported for the library at Monti- cello.60 Jefferson as a great humanitarian and apostle of democracy had much sym- pathy for the black race and was opposed to their condition of bondage. It was probably for this reason, and because of the fact that great minds seek each other despite race and color, that Benjamin Banneker, a self-educated Maryland Negro who did some notable work in astronomy and mathematics, turnedto Jefferson for aid and counsel. Banneker published an almanac showing the re- sults of his study, a copy of which was sent to the Secretary of State in 1791 for his own personal use.6" After his resignation as Secretary of "The Jefferson Papers," Massachusetts His- torical Society Collections (Ser.

BOOKS OF THE VIRGINIA DYNASTY 233 State, Jefferson returned to Monticello, where he devoted his time to books, agri- culture, and the organization of the po- litical party in opposition to the Federal- ists. Books continued as an important item among the articles sent to and from Monticello. In 1795 Jefferson wrote to Judge Stuart of packing some boxes of books to be sent to Colonel Bell and Dabney Carr.62 After the opposition po- litical party was organized and Jefferson had returned to public life, he still found time for literary activity. In 1800 he thanked the Reverend James Madison for his care and safe return of a book by Dr. Priestley.63 Three years later he wrote to Joseph Priestley thanking him for a treatise comparing Socrates and Jesus.64 During his first year as chief executive, President Jefferson spent $391.30 for books and stationery.65 After his term of office expired, Jefferson re- tired to Monticello for the last time, devoting his remaining years to books, to agriculture, and to the establishment of the University of Virginia. He was interested not only in the use of books but also in the making of books. Jefferson encouraged Archibald Binny and James Ronaldson of Philadelphia in establish- ing one of the early type foundries in the United States.66 Financial problems be- came increasingly acute at Monticello for Thomas Jefferson after his retire- ment from the Presidency. In time it became necessary for the former Presi- dent to sell a large number of his books so that he might raise funds to meet certain pressing financial obligations. The burning of some of the public buildings in Washington by the British in 1814 was accompanied by the destruc- tion of most of the books in the Library of Congress.67 The replacement of these books was proposed, and Jefferson of- fered his library for sale. After much congressional debate the offer was finally accepted. The book collection at Monti- cello was purchased for $23,950.00 as a foundation for the new Library of Congress.68 The Jefferson library at the time of its sale in 1815 consisted of nearly seven thousand volumes.69 The collection had been accumulated during the course of nearly half a century through purchase and gift. A number of works at Monti- cello had been secured from the library of Dr. Benjamin Franklin when part of his books were offered for sale by Dufief, a Philadelphia bookseller, in 1803. One of the most outstanding gifts to Jefferson came in 1806, when George Wythe, his old mentor, devised to him "my books and small philosophical apparatus."70 The books in the library at Monticello were classified under twelve different headings as outlined by Jefferson in a letter to James Ogilvie in 1806, includ- ing: (1) ancient history; (2) modern his- tory; (3) physics; (4) natural history; 62 "Papers of Archibald Stuart," William and Mary College Quarterly (Ser.

Among the latter were Gibbon's History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Mitford's History of Greece, and Tracts in Ancient History by Priestley and Fabbroni. It is al- together probable that the tracts were written by Joseph Priestley and Jean Fabbroni, men with whom Jefferson had corresponded. Many of the works on modem history were in French, Italian, and Spanish, including Beverley's His- tory of Virginia in French and Botta's History of the War of Independence in Italian. Among the books on American history in English were Burke's History of Virginia, Mather's Ecclesiastical His- tory of New England, Holmes's American Annals, and Stith's History of Virginia. Works by Franklin, Humboldt, Buffon, Rush, and Peale were listed in the sec- tion devoted to physics, while the tract by Fabbroni, hitherto mentioned, was among the treatments on agriculture. Several books upon architecture were in the library, as was to be expected of a man who could design such a building as his home at Monticello. Among the philosophers whose knowledge contrib- uted to the works in the Jefferson library were Plato, Kant, Locke, Spinoza, and Voltaire. Although Jefferson was accused of being an atheist, and pious ladies in New England are reported to have hid- den their Bibles when he became Presi- dent, there were 188 works upon religion in his book collection.73 The library purchased by Congress contained several hundred legal works, including the Pro- ceedings of the Virginia Company in Eng- land, and other valuable manuscript material pertaining to the early history of the Old Dominion.74 Thomas Jefferson's literary interest and zeal for book collecting did not end with the sale of his library in 1815. In 1819 he wrote to Vine Utley: "I never go to bed without an hour or a half hour's previous reading of something moral whereon to ruminate in the intervals of sleep."7" The same year he thanked Ezra Styles for sending a book, while in 1820 he sent to William Short his famous characterization of Jesus.76 A short time after this Jared Sparks was thanked for "Your favor of September 12th ... with the book accompanying it."77 In 1824 Jefferson was devoting four hours a day to the preparation of a book catalog for the library of the University of Vir- ginia.78 In spite of advancing age and a greatly depleted fortune, Jefferson col- lected nearly one thousand books after his library was sold to Congress. This later collection was advertised for sale at auction in Washington in 1829.79 Thus, Jefferson during his lifetime owned three libraries of note, the first, valued 71 P. L.

BOOKS OF THE VIRGINIA DYNASTY 235 at ?200 sterling, which burned in his mother's house in 1770; the second con- sisting of nearly seven thousand vol- umes, sold to Congress in 1815; and the third, embracing nearly one thousand volumes possessed at the time of his death in 1826. The library at Monticello was used by friends of Jefferson much as the Byrd library had been made available to other Virginians during an earlier period. In March, 1784, James Madison had writ- ten to Jefferson of his inability to use the library at Monticello at that time, but stated that Mr. L. Grymes and Mr. W. Maury had borrowed books there.80 The book collection at Monticello reflected the great diversity of interest of Thomas Jefferson, one of the great philosophers and statesmen that the New World has produced. He had profound respect for other great thinkers, regardless of race, color, or creed. An incident depicting the difference between what he and Alexander Hamilton regarded as true greatness in a man was related in a let- ter to Benjamin Rush in 1811. Jefferson stated: "The room being hung around with a collection of the portraits of re- markable men, among them were those of Bacon, Newton, and Locke, Hamilton asked me who they were. I told him they were my trinity of the three greatest men the world had ever produced, naming them. He paused for some time: 'the greatest man,' said he, 'that ever lived was Julius Caesar.' "I8 Another man of great ability and great mental capacity who attracted Jefferson was his fellow- Virginian who succeeded him as Presi- dent of the United States. James Madison, the third of the Vir- ginia dynasty, was also greatly inter- ested in reading and book-collecting. His early education was under the supervi- sion of Donald Robertson, a Scotsman, and the Reverend Thomas Martin, a clergyman of Madison's home parish. Princeton College was selected as the proper institution of higher learning, and there the young Virginian matricu- lated in 1769. After completing his col- lege work, Madison returned to his home, where he read and studied for two or three years. It was at this time that he revealed his attitude toward the correct subject matter for reading. In Novem- ber, 1772, he wrote to a friend commend- ing him upon his study of history and morals, but added that divinity should not be entirely neglected.82 Shortly after this Madison entered public life and his ability soon won recognition in the Old Dominion. He was studying Dean Tucker's Tracts on the trouble between Great Britain and her American colonies in 1774.83 Madison was elected as a dele- gate to the Continental Congress in 1780, and there he became a skilful debater, revealing his knowledge of English con- stitutional law and the necessity of its application for the successful operation of the new government. He realized the need of a reference library for the use of the members of Congress. This same need had been recognized by his fellow- Virginian, Theodorick Bland, member of Congress, who, according to reliable historical evidence, on or before Novem- ber 12, 1782, offered a motion that Con- gress should import a list of books from Europe for the use of the United States in Congress. Theodorick Bland soon left 10 Letters and Other Wtritings of James Madison (Philadelphia: J. B.

236 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY Congress, and the responsibility for recommending the purchase of books for the use of Congress was assumed by James Madison, now the spokesman for the committee formerly headed by Bland.84 On January 24, 1783, the re- port prepared by James Madison for the committee was given to Congress but failed of adoption."' The arguments against the purchase of reference books for Congress were based entirely on the need for economy.86 Thus, even before the treaty of peace had been signed end- ing the American Revolution, James Madison was active in support of the beginning of a library for the Congress of the United States. Not only was James Madison an avid reader and book collector, but, like his friend Thomas Jefferson, he encouraged others in their writing. While Madison was a member of the Congress, he la- bored diligently in the interests of au- thors in the United States. Joel Barlow and other interested writers, early in 1783, had "presented a memorial to the Continental Congress petitioning for a recommendation that the several states enact copyright laws." In May, 1783, after receiving the favorable report of a committee, of which Madison was a member, the Congress passed the de- sired resolution.87 James Madison read widely and had a great diversity of interests. In 1784 he wrote to Thomas Jefferson of reading Buffon's work on natural history.88 The following year Jefferson, who was then in Paris, was commissioned to buy books for Madison. These were to be treatises on ancient and modern federal republics and works by Pascal, Don Ulloa, and Linnaeus. Madison also replied to Jeffer- son's invitation to visit Europe: "This . . . would be particularly inconvenient as it would break in upon a course of reading which, if I neglect now, I shall never resume."89 It is evident from this statement that Madison could not be lured away from his books even by the prospect of traveling in Europe with his close friend. The same year Madison wrote to Edmund Randolph that Coke's Littleton an(l other legal works were his "chief society during the winter."90 Jefferson faithfully executed Madison's commission, as the latter wrote, in 1786, of receiving from Havre de Grace two trunks of books, mostly in French.9" Two years later Madison wrote that he would attempt to dispose of some books sent to him by IPhilip Mazzei but had little hope of success because of the fact that they were all written in French.92 After the strong antagonism developed be- tween Hamilton and Jefferson while in the Cabinet, Madison became an ad- herent to the party of the latter. He sent a pamphlet to the Secretary of State in 1793 which he had annotated. Locke and Montesquieu were mentioned, and Madison wrote: "I use Montesquieu, also from memory, thus I believe with- out inaccuracy."93 During the Napoleonic Wars, Ameri- 8" Fulmer Mood, "The Continental Congress and the Plan for a Library of Congress in 1782-1783," Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, LXXII (January, 1948), 10-12. 8 Journals of the Continental Congress, XXIV, 83.

BOOKS OF THE VIRGINIA DYNASTY 237 can shipping was often involved in ques- tions of international law. Madison was much concerned and, writing in 1806, referred to the views of Grotius, Puffen- dorf, and Vattel, upon the rights of neu- trals.94 While Madison was Chief Ex- ecutive of the United States, the question of purchasing Jefferson's library for the use of Congress arose and the President gave his hearty approval to the meas- ure.95 Upon his retirement from the Pres- idency, Madison made his home at Montpelier in Orange County, Virginia, managing his estate and devoting his leisure time to books and writing. He wrote to Jefferson in 1821 agreeing that "the tax imposed on books imported . . . ought not to be" and that the small amount of revenue derived therefrom sacrificed intellectual improvement.96 Al- though Madison corresponded with Jef- ferson concerning books and reading material until the time of the latter's death, he also discussed these matters with other individuals.97 In 1817 he ex- tended his thanks to J. B. Say for a trea- tise on political economy and expressed his pleasure to Carlo Botta, the Italian historian, for the receipt of Camillo.98 That same year John Adams' present of a two-volume work by Condorcet was acknowledged, while four years later Madison discussed with R. Chapman different plans for reading history and some of the good books in each field.99 In 1827 Madison extended to Edward Everett and his brother his gratitude for the present of the latter's work on Ameri- ca.?00 Thus, up until the time of his death in 1836, James Madison read much and showed great interest in whatever m&- terial he perused. In his last will, drawn up in 1835, Madison stated: "I give to the Univer- sity of Virginia all that portion of my library of which it has not copies of the same editions, and which may be thought by the Board of Visitors not unworthy of a place in its library, reserving to my wife the right first to select such particu- lar books and pamphlets as she shall choose, not exceeding three hundred volumes."'01 No catalog of the library was made, but the book collection must have been large, as Madison had been collecting books during his entire life- time. From his father he had received a large number of books, as the elder James Madison was much interested in literary matters and had purchased the library of Lord Dunmore when it was seized and offered for sale.102 The library at Montpelier also included the books belonging to Dorothy Payne Todd Madison, wife of James Madison. The books devised to her by her first husband, John Todd, were valued at ?187 15s. Od. in the inventory of his estate made in December, 1793.103 The library at Montpelier was located in a room on the second floor. It has been stated that the walls and the center of the room were so filled with bookcases that there was barely room to pass by them."04 The pro- 14 Ibid., II, 234, 240, 249. 96 Ibid., II, 588, 602.

238 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY visions of Madison's will regarding the library were not carried out by his wid- ow, and possession of the books by the University of Virginia was secured only through a lawsuit, settled after Mrs. Madison's death.105 Although Madison did not show the genius and versatility that characterized Jefferson, he was a man of great talent and literary ability. His love of books is reflected in their fre- quent mention in his letters and by the large library which he collected. Information concerning the literary interests of the next President of the United States who came from Virginia is greatly limited. James Monroe was born in Westmoreland County, Virginia, in 1758. After completing his preparatory schooling, Monroe entered William and Mary College in 1774 and remained there until he entered the Continental Army in 1776. He remained in the serv- ice until 1780 and had been advanced to the rank of lieutenant-colonel when dis- charged. He had been recommended by Washington and Lord Stirling for further service, but the exhausted finances of the country made the raising of a new regiment impossible. Monroe was com- pelled to retire from the service because of the lack of a command. He was greatly disappointed and retired to his home where he spent some time seeking solace in books.'00 Monroe soon entered public life and in 1783 was sent as a member of the Continental Congress from Virginia. During much of his life he was financially handicapped. An evidence of this was recorded in 1785 when he wrote to Jef- ferson in France thanking him for send- ing the Encyclopedia and promising to send the money soon, although he did not have the amount at that time.107 The same year, Monroe received a copy of Jefferson's Notes on Virginia, together with news of a balloon ascension and disaster in France.108 In 1786 Jefferson had not been reimbursed for the Encyclo- pedia, as Monroe expressed regret that he had not yet been able to tender pay- ment.109 A few years later Monroe was in a position to reciprocate the favors of Jefferson and other Virginia friends. He was commissioned Minister to France in 1794 and two years later wrote to James Madison from Paris: "I wish you to send me a list of what other things you want & especially of books, & I will provide & send or bring them with me when I return home.""' Soon afterward a similar offer was made to Jefferson, who had desired additional volumes of the Encyclopedia."' Monroe's official conduct in France did not meet with the approval of the Federalist party and he was recalled. He felt that his recall was not justified and upon his return wrote a book reviewing the whole affair. It bore the lengthy title A View of the Conduct of the Executive in the Foreign Affairs of the United States; the subject matter aroused much an- tagonism among the Federalists, while the Jeffersonian party praised it highly. Many copies were sold and the work was later republished in London."2 After the election of Jefferson the question of an outlet of the mouth of the Mississippi River became serious and 106 Lester J.

BOOKS OF THE VIRGINIA DYNASTY 239 Monroe was appointed as one of the en- voys to France in 1803 to negotiate the purchase of Louisiana. Writing from New York before embarking, Monroe requested Jefferson to deliver a book sent for Mr. Volney."11 The following September a volume written by a Mr. Williams was sent to the President from London by Monroe, while in 1804 he of- fered his services to Archibald Stuart if the latter should desire the procuring of books from the English booksellers.'14 A letter to Jefferson from Monroe three years later expressed the hope that upon returning to Albemarle his "many books ... will be in the state I left them.""' While in Washington in 1812 as a mem- ber of Madison's Cabinet, Monroe con- tributed to his brother Joseph's support. He wrote to a friend that he had fur- nished money and books to Joseph Mon- roe, hoping that this assistance would pave the way for self-support."6 Two years later support was promised in the sale of Jefferson's library to Con- gress by the Secretary of War, who re- gretted that the sacrifice was neces- sary."7 After he became President of the United States, Monroe extended the use of his library to ambitious youth men studying law. One profiting from this generosity was Thomas Gilmer, who received a letter from his brother in 1820 congratulating him upon his good for- tune.1"8 James Monroe did not long sur- vive after his retirement from the Presi- dency. His death occurred in 1831 at the home of his daughter in New York City. It is not known whether a catalog of his library was ever made, so that any state- ment concerning its size and character must be merely a matter of conjecture."9 The wide reading of this group of eminent men, especially of Jefferson and Madison, in history, law, and political philosophy, was revealed in their letters and other writings. Their literary talents were practically and immortally em- ployed in connection with the writing of the two documents concerned with the founding of the United States. Thomas Jefferson was intimately con- cerned with the formulation and writing of the Declaration of Independence, while Madison was conspicuous among the writers of the Constitution of the United States. 3 Ibid., IV, 8. 114 Ibid., IV, 75, 169. 115 Ibid., V, 1. 116 "Letters of James Monroe," Tyler's Historical & Genealogical Magazine, IV (October, 1922), p. 108.
