BOOKS ON THE FRONTIER: THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF BOOK OWNERSHIP IN SOUTHERN INDIANA, 1800-1850 MICHAEL H. HARRIS ABSTRACT The quality of the cultural life of the American frontier has long been in dispute. Some historians argue that the frontier forced the pioneers to revert to a near barbaric stage while it divested them of all aspects of their former cultures. Others maintain with equal vigor that the society which developed on each frontier was very nearly a carbon copy of the settled areas further east, and that the culture of Americans had not been significantly altered by the frontier process. Most agree, however, that evidence testifying to the nature and extent of book ownership provides one means of measuring the progress of culture on the frontier. This paper summarizes the results of an intensive study of this topic on the southern Indiana frontier. Data were collected from a variety of sources, but especially important were county probate records, which often contained inventories indicating books owned by early Indiana residents. An examination of over 2,000 inventories located in sixteen southern Indiana counties produced descriptions of more than 500 private libraries. An analysis of these libraries shows that the pattern of book ownership was not startingly different from that revealed by similar studies of book ownership in the American colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth cen- turies. Clearly, books were not impossible to acquire in early Indiana, and a sizable proportion of the estates inventoried in the counties studied contained books. Most of the collections were small and narrowly religious in nature, with larger libraries still tending toward the utilitarian. However, a small number of inventories were discovered which listed large numbers of books; a few men-those with both the means and the inclination-built large and well-balanced li- braries on the Indiana frontier. The nature and extent of "culture" on America's successive frontiers has long been in dispute.1 Some scholars argue that the first pioneers reverted to a near barbaric stage when they came into contact with the frontier; that they divested themselves of all aspects of their former cultures; that the Westerner had reached, in the words of Arthur K. Moore, "The fateful con- clusion that the experience of settling a garden provides better answers to the great questions about life and eternity than the collective wisdom of the found- ers of Western Civilization" [2, p. 247]. In opposition to this view, other scholars, following the lead of Frederick Jackson Turner [3], have stated their belief that the first pioneers were forced to grapple with a vicious natural envi- ronment, and that in order to subdue their new wilderness homes they were forced to revert to a state of near sav- agery, abandoning any thought of things cultural while they devoted all their efforts to solidifying their hold on the land. Later as conditions grew more settled, society began a gradual ascent from this savage condition. But this new society was not the same as that which the settlers had known prior to their encounter with the frontier, for 1 This paper is drawn in part from my unpub- lished dissertation at Indiana University [11.

Wright, argue that the society which developed in each ensuing West was very nearly a carbon copy of the society found in the more settled areas further east; that culture was trans- planted to each successive frontier nearly unchanged; and that it had not been significantly altered by the "fron- tier process" [51]. Perhaps much of the disagreement can be understood as the result of rivalry between differing schools or interpretations of the American frontier experience. Another basis for debate lies in the nature of the evidence, which often proves puzzling and con- tradictory and which has led even the most objective historians to varying conclusions. Finally, there has been too little systematic study of the evidence. Thus the resolution of the debate would seem to rest partially, at least, on fur- ther examination of the evidence testi- fying to the extent and nature of culture on the frontier. Scholars have utilized a number of different sources of information in their attempts to resolve the essential ques- tions surrounding cultural life on the American frontier, but it is becoming increasingly popular to use evidence re- lating to the availability, ownership, and reading of books as a major indica- tor. Louis B. Wright nicely summarized this approach when he wrote: "The choice of books brought by the first settlers, or imported as soon as they had established themselves in the wil- derness, provides a significant clue to their conception of intellectual and social values" [6, p. 139]. Richard Wade, in his The Urban Frontier, echoed Wright's sentiment when he noted that, "since books form another integral part of the apparatus of learn- ing and civilized living, their number, quality, and availability evidence the cultural stature of these new communi- ties" [7, p. 139]. The significance of library and book history as an integral part of American cultural history seems to be generally accepted among intellec- tual historians in America. Some systematic studies of the nature and extent of book ownership and read- ing on the frontier have been made [8; 9, pp. 253-61; 10]. Generally, however, most information on this subject is found buried in larger studies of the social and cultural history of the West [11, 12, 13]. The authors of these studies have usually relied on book advertisements in newspapers as barom- eters of reading interests. Generaliza- tions on this evidence are founded upon the assumption that booksellers must have known what the public wanted to buy, and as a result chose to advertise those books that they knew would sell. However, studies that show any actual correlation between the availabil- ity of books and their sale or circulation in frontier areas are lacking. It is pos- sible that the book advertisements were really intended to stimulate interest in books that were not selling well. Or the bookstore owners may have promoted, in their advertisements, the kinds of books which they alone could supply, feeling that it was not necessary to advertise the popular varieties of books available in general stores. Or perhaps the frequent failures of bookstores in the West are attributable to an inability on the part of their owners to judge, accurately, the reading tastes of their potential customers. If any or all of these conditions existed, it would mean that the assessment of the popularity
418 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY of various books, novels for instance, based on newspaper advertisements might well be in need of revision. Contributing to this lack of studies is the fact that business records con- cerning the sale of books by the book- sellers, subscription book agents, and book hawkers who operated on the vari- ous frontiers are very scarce. Library circulation records are almost com- pletely absent. While little can be learned of book sales on the frontier, much can be learned about actual book ownership among pioneers from a widely avail- able, but generally overlooked, source the estate inventories in county pro- bate records. As counties and their legal apparatus were founded throughout the West, the new settlers were quick to establish probate courts. Statutes were passed in nearly every state in basically the same form, and read that within ninety days of the death of a county resident, a "full and perfect inventory of his possessions was to be taken," and that if his property was sold, "an ac- count of such sales, should be kept" [14]. These inventories, often extremely detailed, might list anything from a broken broom handle to the most valu- able items, such as horses, guns, and plows. Those responsible for the inven- tories also appraised the value of each item. Such inventories prove fascinating reading for those interested in the. avail- ability of books, book ownership, or the development of reading tastes, for if the deceased owned any books at his death that fact is almost certain to appear in the lists. My own investigations concerning book ownership among early settlers in the Ohio Valley have led me to agree with Wright and Wade when they argue that the evidence testifying to the extent of book ownership and reading provides one means of measuring the progress of culture on the frontier [15, 16]. These limited studies, and other published re- search, suggested the need for an in- depth study of book ownership in one area during its frontier period. Southern Indiana, 1800-1850, was selected as a workable test case, and an intensive study was made of some 2,000 estate inventories in order to provide answers to the following questions: (1) What was the extent and nature of book ownership in southern Indiana between 1800 and 1850? And (2) what titles or types of printed matter were most widely owned? The probate records analyzed were drawn from sixteen Indiana counties located south of the National Road. These were selected in an attempt to provide a geographical distribution. Care was taken to insure the selection of counties which were located on the major river routes, such as the Ohio and White Rivers, and a number of counties were chosen which were "in- land" and devoid of major waterways. Further, the counties included were populated as was most of the southern part of the state, by a heterogeneous population representing a diversity of religious, ethnic, and economic back- grounds. Table 1 summarizes the sample and the most general results of the study. Of over 2,000 inventories examined, 469 or 22 percent mentioned books. The per- centage of inventories mentioning books ranged from 4 percent in Harrison County to 72 percent for Lawrence County. No attempt is made here to explain that range, except to say that the area was settled by a heterogeneous group of people. Of the 469 inventories

When counting items only titles were noted. A 4-volume editiob of Don Quixote was counted as 1. When "a lot of books" or "books" were encountered they were counted in all cases as 2 titles. In a few cases an inventory read simply "S boolcs" or "10 books." In each case the number cited was counted as the number of titles in the library. that mentioned books, 70 percent re- corded collections of 1-5 titles, 15 per- cent of 6-10 titles, and 14 percent of 11-55 titles. The size of continuum was somewhat broken then by three collec- tions of over 75 titles. The results as a whole bring into view nearly 500 li- braries, a far greater number than has ever before been analyzed for this area in this period. Dividing the collections by size throws some light on the following ques- tions: (1) wealth of owner; (2) char- acteristics of size. For instance, the size of libraries seems to have depended in part upon the personal wealth of the owner. The average value of the estates which contained 1-5 titles was $421; that of estates with 6-10 titles was $499; that of estates with 11-60 titles was $817. Table 2 analyzes the type of books contained in the smallest libraries (1- 5 books). More than 50 percent of the books comprising the small libraries were religious in nature, with Bibles constituting more than one half of the items in the religious classification. These libraries had a pragmatic tone as is illustrated by the large number of law books, medical books, textbooks, and dictionaries owned. The typical small library on the southern Indiana frontier contained a Bible and a hymnbook. Those libraries with more than 2 titles often included a copy of Buck's popular theological dictionary, Gunn's Domestic Medicine, or Walker's Dictionary. Occasionally a biography of Washington or Bonaparte or a religious leader would be included. A few examples suggest the flavor of these libraries. That of Jesse Lynch, whose property was inventoried in Daviess County in 1832, contained a Bible, hymnal, songbook, dictionary, and English reader [17]. The books were valued at $2.00, while Lynch's
420 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY estate was estimated to be worth $242.87Y/2. Another collection of books was listed among the belongings of William Parker of Warrick County in 1824 [18]. Parker's library consisted of a Bible, a hymnbook, and a "Life of Abbot." His collection was valued at $1.50, the estate at $66.0534. This general pattern was sometimes broken. For instance, the only books owned by Addison Green, a Dubois County farmer whose estate was inventoried in 1845, were 4 volumes of Plutarch's Lives valued at $1.25 [19]. Table 3 analyzes the contents of the seventy collections which contained 6- 10 titles. This group of libraries con- tained a smaller percentage of religious works and a slightly larger percentage of belles lettres and books dealing with history and biography than did those in the 1-5 category. Representative ex- amples of these libraries include that of Allen B. Vancleave, inventoried on March 2 1, 1834, which contained a small Bible, Dupey's Hymns, Walker's Dictionary, a testament, a copy of Beauchamp's Confession, two English readers, and a "Horse Book" [20]. Another example is the library of Milo Townsend, inventoried in Gibson County in 1841, which contained a large Bible, a history of England, Dodd's Prison Thoughts, the Golden Treasury, Dupey's Hymns, Smiley's Arithmatic, The Western Pilot, and Volney's Ruins [21]. More diversified is the collection of James McGuthrie who died at his residence on Main Cross Street, August 8, 1838, in Madison [22]. McGuthrie's library contained 2 volumes of Shake- speare's works, a bookkeeping text, a 4-volume set of Don Quixote, Buck's TABLE 2 TYPES OF BOOKS CONTAINED EN LIRBARIES RANGING IN SIZE FROM 1 TO 5 TiTLES No. of Items Percentage of Type of Book in Category Total Textbooks & children's books ...... ......... 29 7 Dictionaries ............................... 31 7 Encyclopedias .............................. 4 1 Almanacs ................................. 1 0 Law books ............................... 9 2 History & biography ......... .............. 38 9 Geography & Atlases .......... ............. 18 4 Travel & description ......... ............. 14 3 Medical works ................ 18 4 Music ................................... 3 1 Farm books ........ 3 1 Literature .............. 10 2 Annuals, collections, gifts ................. 3 1 Novels ................................. 4 1 Poetry . .1 0 Drama .................................0 0 Essays ................................. 2 0 Religious works ............... ............ 248 57 Bibles .................................. 124 29 Testaments . ............................ 15 3 Hymnbooks ............................. 56 13 Other .................................. 53 12 Miscellaneous .............................. 9 2 Total ................................ 435 100 NoTE.-Biblical dictionaries were counted as "Dictionaries." * Percentages were rounded to the nearest percentage point.

Theological Dictionary, a history of the United States, Walker's Dictionary, an English grammar, The Arabian Nights, and a biography of Napoleon. One library which suggests much about the religious views of its owner, is that of Isaac Lambert [23]. Lam- bert, whose estate was inventoried in 1827 in Vigo County, contained Jose- phus's History of the Jews, Coke's Com- mentaries on the Bible, Wood's Dic- tionary of the Bible, Fletcher's Appeal, Fletcher's Letters, Harvey's Medita- tions, a Bible, one volume of Wesley's Sermons, one volume of Wesley's Jour- nal, and a biography of Benjamin Franklin. Table 4 summarizes the types of books contained in the libraries which ranged in size from 11 to 55 volumes. This group of libraries contained a higher percentage of belles lettres than the earlier categories. At the same time the percentage for religious works was smaller. The sixty-four libraries in this category ranged from heavily religious to extremely practical, and include some extensive collections of belles lettres. Just listing their contents would take more than fifty pages. A collection with a larger than usual religious orientation was that of Joseph Shera, a Franklin County farmer. His estate, inventoried in 1832, was valued at $749, and included the following works: a family Bible, several hymn- books, the Methodist Magazine, Wesley's Appeal, Fletcher's Checks, the Saints Rest, 1 volume of Wesley's Sermons, Clark's Commentaries on Ro- mans, a biography of Reverend Fletcher, Devine Providence, and a selection of unbound tracts [24].

An example of such a library is that owned by William Cook in 1844 [25]. In addition to a Bible, hymnbooks, and several other religious titles, it contained biographies of Jack- son, Franklin, Washington, William Penn, G. F. Morrison, as well as a collection of Jack Downing's Letters. History was represented by Goldsmith's History of Rome, History of Greece, and History of the United States. Liter- ary works included The Children of the Abbey, Jane Porter's popular Scottish Chiefs, and several collections of Tales. Finally, the collection was rounded out by a number of spellers, primers, readers, a geography, and a dictionary. Another example illustrating both the balance and diversity of libraries in this category is the collection of William Patterson, inventoried in Knox County in 1845 [26]. Patterson's estate was valued at more than $1,500 and con- tained some 20 titles, many of them multi-volume works. Included were the Bible Explained and a 2-volume set of the Spiritual Treasury. Literary works included a 15-volume set of British Theatre, 7 volumes of Fielding's Works, 6 of Swift's Letters, 4 of the Tatler, 4 of Shakespeare's Works, and a 6-volume set of the Turkish Spy. History and biography were represented by a 34- volume History of England, and lives of Washington, Fletcher, and Blair. This collection was enriched with several French works, Simpson's Euclid, a med- ical guide, a dictionary, a geography, and the "Travellers Own Book." The final column in table 1 concerns three libraries which numbered more than 75 titles. The owners of these libraries-Thomas Posey, General
BOOKS ON THE FRONTIER: SOUTHERN INDIANA 423 Washington Johnston, and Richard Price-were all prominent lawyers. However, their collections, unlike the collections of other professional men not discussed below, were not narrowly "professional" in makeup, and are pre- sented here as examples of the large well-balanced libraries built on the frontier by men who had the means and the inclination to do so.2 Posey, who was to reach prominence in Kentucky and Indiana politics, was born in Fairfax County, Virginia, on July 9, 1750 [27, vol. 15, p. 111]. During the Revolutionary War he saw considerable action and retired as a colonel in 1783. Ten years later he was commissioned a brigadier general and joined Wayne in the campaign against the Indians that culminated in the battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794. He resigned from the military a sec- ond time in 1794 and moved to Ken- tucky, where he was elected to the state senate, and in 1805 was chosen Speaker. Later he moved to Louisiana where he was appointed U.S. senator in 1812. In 1813 he was appointed by President Madison as governor of the Indiana Territory to succeed William Henry Harrison. In ill health, he lived in Jef- fersonville, which offered more satis- factory medical care than the territorial capital, Corydon. When Indiana entered the Union in 1816, he ran for governor, but was defeated by Jonathan Jennings. Posey was in most respects self- taught and appears to have had a con- siderable interest in books. In addition to gathering a large library he was ac- tive in the Jeffersonville Bible Society, "and did much to distribute the scrip- tures among the poor and the needy of the territory" [28, vol. 1, p. 318]. Posey's estate was probated in 1818 and was valued at more than $1,000 [29].3 The library, which constituted a major part of his personal estate, ranks as one of the largest collections assembled in early Indiana, numbering some 90 titles in 213 volumes. In addition to its size, the library strikes one as being carefully selected to provide balance; it had no particular strengths. Perhaps Posey, always the Virginia gentleman, sought to emulate his English counterpart in his book- collecting efforts. The English model required balance, and as Daniel Boor- stin points out, the gentleman was "per- mitted to be literate but dared not be bookish: pedantry and the squint of the specialist were to be avoided like the plague" [30]. Posey's library contained a number of religious works. For instance, it had a 4-volume Bible, several volumes of sermons, a dozen collections of hymns, the Confession of Faith and Discipline of the Methodist Church, Hervey's Meditations, a collection of family prayers, and a life of Christ. History and biography were also well represented. Historical works included a 12-volume set of Hume's History of England, A History of the American Revolution, and Goldsmith's histories of England and Greece. Biographies ranged from studies of Washington, Philip of Spain, and Louis XIV, to Charles V. He also owned a set of Plutarch's Lives and a 7-volume work entitled the British Plutarch. Literary works are less plentiful, but 2 Some two dozen libraries uncovered in the course of this study are not discussed above. They are narrowly professional collections owned by doctors and lawyers, and their inclusion here would have distorted the statistical presentation. For a discussion of the "professional" libraries see Harris [1, chap. 81. 3 The books in Posey's library are listed in [1].
424 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY nevertheless comprise a substantial por- tion of the collection. Included are a number of multivolume sets of essays, an 8-volume set of Shakespeare's works, 7 volumes of Sterne's works, and 8 volumes of the works of Pope. Posey's interest in political and mili- tary affairs is evident in his library. Works such as a Guide to the Rights and Priviledges of Englishmen, The Rights of Man, Jefferson's Notes [on Virginia?], Peter Porcupine, and Paine's Works testify to his interest in American politics. In addition he owned 11 volumes of the Journals of the House, and 15 volumes of the State Papers. Several works on military tactics and a volume of Military Exer- cises remind us of his record as a soldier. A number of utilitarian items form what might be termed the miscellaneous portion of his collection. Included are an 18-volume encyclopedia, several dictionaries, works on medicine, garden- ing, surveying, mathematics, astrology, and navigation. Finally, one last book -the catalogue of the Washington li- brary, a local social library-provided its owner with access to a second large collection of useful books. Another Virginian, General Washing- ton Johnston (General was his first name and not a military title), was the owner of a library which ranked next to Posey's as one of the largest private collections located in the state prior to 1850. Johnston was born in Culpepper County, Virginia, near where George Washington had lived for many years. He moved west to Vincennes. Indiana Territory, in 1793 at the age of seventeen. George Wilson has summa- rized Johnston's extensive contributions to his adopted state: "He was the first postmaster of Vincennes (1800), the first lawyer in Vincennes, the organizer of the Knox County Bar Association, a member of the first territorial legisla- ture (elected April 2nd, 1810), a mem- ber of the first board of trustees of Vincennes University, adjutant-general of Indiana Territory, three times chair- man of the borough of Vincennes, twice president judge of the court, a member of the state legislature for several terms, and during the seventh session was speaker of the house of representatives" [31] .4 In addition to these activities, Johnston was also a founder and active user of the Vincenines Library Com- pany, compiler of one of the first col- lections of laws to be printed in the Territory, and a prominent Mason [31, 32]. Johnston's record of service and in- terests suggests a man dedicated to the life of the mind as well as public service. Unfortunately, no record of his formal education has come to light, but an analysis of his speeches suggests that he read widely in history, the classics, and law [31]. Further evidence of Johnston's exposure to books can be drawn from the list of titles owned at his death. General Washington Johnston died on October 26, 1833, and his sizable estate was inventoried on November 18 [33].5 Those responsible for taking the inventory were careful in their work, and as a result their inventory provides a detailed list of the contents of John- ston's large library of over 300 vol- umes.6 4 Johnston's life is described in detail in [311. 5 Johnston's library is listed in [1]. 6 There is one puzzling aspect of Johnston's life. While none of his biographies mentions the fact, it appears from contemporary evidence that he was, in addition to his other occupations, a general store owner or a bookseller. The picture is unclear, but on January 16, 1807, he sold 13 titles to the Vincennes Library Company for $18.70, and on
BOOKS ON THE FRONTIER: SOUTHERN INDIANA 425 Like Posey, Johnston owned more books relating to theology than any other subject. In addition to the Bibles, one English and one French, he owned some 40 religious works. To aid the Bible reader were reference works such as Buck's Theological Dictionary, Horne's Introduction to the Study of the Scriptures, and Adam Clarke's 6- volume Commentary on the Old and New Testaments. Also present were half a dozen collections of sermons and a number of well-known doctrinal tracts such as the Reverend John Fletcher's Checks on Antinomianism and Robert Owen's Opening Speech and His Reply to the Rev. Alexander Campbell in the Recent Public Discussion in Cincinnati, to Prove That the Principles of All Re- ligions Are Erroneous, and That Their Practice Is Injurious to the Human Race. The religious portion of his li- brary also included a number of popular historical and inspirational works such as John Foxe's Book of Martyrs, Jose- phus's History of the Jews, and Richard Baxter's Saint's Everlasting Rest. Johnston's professional and political interests are amply evidenced in that part of his collection which might be classed as law. He owned over half a dozen works on the practice of law as well as the Declaration of Indepen- dence, The Acts of Congress, Acts and Journals of Indiana, and a 10-volume set of the Laws of Indiana. His library also contained a number of literary works. In addition to sub- scribing to the Spectator on a regular basis, he owned the works of Shake- speare, Milton, Sterne, Cervantes, and Virgil. Johnston appears to have been well read in history and biography. The list of historical works in his library in- cludes Rollin's popular Ancient History in 10 volumes, David Ramsay's History of the United States to 1808 and a History of England. Biographies in- clude lives of Napoleon, Clay, and Weem's best-selling life of Washington. Finally, he also owned a book consid- ered basic to a gentleman's library: Plutarch's Lives. Johnston's library seems to have been carefully planned to provide the same kind of balance found in Posey's col- lection. For in addition to the works mentioned above, it contained a num- ber of reference works such as Abel Boyer's English-French Dictionary and William Nicholson's 12-volume British Encyclopedia, or Dictionary of the Arts, a number of texts such as Lindley Mur- ray's Grammar, works on medicine; and several almanacs and gazetteers. A third library which illustrates the nature of the large private collection on the frontier is that owned by Richard P. Price. Very little biographical infor- mation is available on Price. It is known that he was a lawyer, and that in 1823 he was commissioned Associate Judge May 18, 1811 according to the minutes: "The Board purchased of General Washington Johnston the following books for the prices thereto annexed Viz: Rambler 4 vol. $ 4.00 Adventurer 4 " 4.00 Denon's Travels 2 " 5.00 Tookes Catherine 2 " 7.00 Volneys View 3.50 Washingtons Monuments of Patriotism 2.50 Duncans Logic 1.00 Lavater on Physiognomy 1.00 Essay on Crimes 1.00 Charms of Literature 1.00 $30.00" [32, pp. 336, 3591. Further evidence of his book- selling activities appears in the form of an adver- tisement in the Western Sun (Vincennes), July 15, 1815, which reads simply, "I have a number of good new books which I will sell cheap for cash."
426 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY of Knox County. His commission was renewed in 1830 for seven years, and he died in 1834 possessed of an estate valued at $8,000 [34]. Price's library evidences much of the same kind of balance found in the col- lections owned by Posey and Johnston, although he owned fewer religious titles and slightly more titles in the belles lettres and history categories. One of the most noteworthy char- acteristics of the 469 libraries analyzed in the preceding pages is their emphasis on utility. The Hoosiers were not espe- cially bookish, and like their ancestors they tended to buy those works which Cotton Mather had recommended to an earlier generation as "Devout and Use- ful" books. Religious works describing God's relationship with man, and works trac- ing the path to eventual salvation were considered essential by many nineteenth- century Christians. Sectarian beliefs tended to influence the selection of many works on divinity, but certain pious works weighed heavy on the book shelves of early Hoosiers. The Bible was cited 209 times in the 469 book collections analyzed. It is re- markable that so few of the collections contained this most popular work. Pos- sibly, the absence of Bibles in many inventories stems from their value as cherished family heirlooms and record books. The pioneers were in the habit of recording their genealogies in their Bi- bles and sometimes used them as diaries. For this reason they were often passed on to the children or other relatives when the owner's death seemed immi- nent [35]. Numerous examples of Bi- bles used as genealogies and diaries are extant in southern Indiana, and perhaps this theory explains the lack of Bibles in many of the inventories examined for this study. A further reason for their absence, at least after 1843, may have been a law exempting them from certain inventories. However, of some seventy- five inventories filed after 1843, thirty- three contained Bibles, nearly 50 per- cent. A companion piece to the Bible in many pioneer homes was the hymnbook. The one most frequently listed was writ- ten by England's first significant writer of hymns, the Reverend Dr. Isaac Watts. Watts published his first collec- tion of hymns in 1707, and for over a century his works were the most popular sources of American hymnody [36, p. 71. One further book, the theological dictionary, was important in those homes where serious Bible study was a consistant and significant part of every- day life. Forty of the collections an- alyzed for this study contained such dictionaries. By far the most popular was Charles Buck's Theological Dic- tionary, Containing Definitions of All Theological and Ecclesiastical terms; an Impartial Account of the Several De- nominations That Have Subsisted in the Religious World; Remarkable Transactions and Events in Ecclesiasti- cal History, and a Biographical Sketch of Writers in Theological Science, which was first published in 1802 and went through numerous editions [37, vol. 3, p. 198]. Most people were satisfied to glean what little religious history they needed from the Bible and theological dic- tionaries like Buck's. However, a con- siderable number also owned 1 or more of the popular religious histories of the day. The works which ranked among the 10 most cited titles in the 469 libraries studied were Josephus's His- tory of the Jews and John Foxe's Actes
BOOKS ON THE FRONTIER: SOUTHERN INDIANA 427 and Monuments of the Church, or as it was more commonly known, Book of the Martyrs.7 Flavius Josephus, usually shortened to Josephus, was born in Jerusalem in A.D. 3 7 and died some time between A.D. 95 and 100. His famous work, Antiquities of the Jews, which originally appeared in 20 books, traces the history of the Jewish people to the year A.D. 66. It was a work highly recommended to all who were interested in biblical history, and it sold widely in the United States in a 1-volume translation by Whiston [38, p. 59]. John Foxe, the famous martyrologist, wrote his Actes and Monuments of the Church about the middle of the six- teenth century. First published in English in 1563, it was an immediate success. The tales of Christian martyr- dom emphasized the role of the Roman church. It enjoyed wide popularity in this country, and no one "can calculate the enormous influence of Foxe's de- scriptions of persecutions by Catholics in keeping alive hatred of Romanism in the breasts of American Protestants" [6, p. 133]. The purposeful nature of the books purchased by early Hoosiers is further illustrated by the large number of items intended to aid in the instruction of youtlh. Grammars, arithmetics, geogra- phies, and readers abound in the inven- tories. In addition to these works many a small family library contained a language dictionary. Thirty of the 49 language dictionaries cited were copies of John Walker's Critical Pronouncing Dictionary and Exposition of the Pnglish Language, which first appeared n 1791. While Hoosier pioneers often brought )nly the most utilitarian of books, they it the same time displayed the aversion For farm books that characterized the rural people throughout the nation [39, ?. 13]. Almost none of the libraries contained works written intentionally is aids for the farmer. Another significant characteristic of the book collections studied was their conservative nature. The books most often owned were those tried and true titles that the settlers had known in the East. But to say that the book collec- tions found in the homes of the early settlers of southern Indiana were con- servative and purposeful does not mean that there were no works of pure enter- tainment among them. Certainly the majority of the libraries studied here contained very few books which could be termed belles lettres. Nevertheless, nine of these libraries contained the works of Shakespeare, and many of the popular English poets are also repre- sented. One fact that does emerge from an analysis of the belles lettres found in private libraries in southern Indiana is the almost total neglect of novels, and more specifically, American novels. Jane Porter's Scottish Chiefs is cited five times, Sterne's Tristam Shandy is found in three libraries, as is Cervantes's Don Quixote. Half a dozen other English novels, including Fielding's Tom Jones, and Smollett's Roderick Random, are cited once each. Not a single novel by Sir Walter Scott was located in the 469 libraries, although his Lady of the Lake was cited once. The only American novel listed was Hugh Henry Bracken- ridge's Modern Chivalry, which was 7 That best-seller list would read as follows. Out of 469 book collections analyzed, the Bible appeared 209 times, dictionaries were cited 133 times; hymnbooks were cited 118 times; arithme- tics were cited 44 times; Josephus's History of the Jews and Foxe's Actes and Monuments were each listed 19 times.
428 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY listed twice. The Hoosier pioneers evi- dently were not impressed by the pleas of the literary nationalists who called for support of American literary works.8 Of course, no one can say with cer- tainty that the absence of novels from the inventories means that the individ- uals involved did not read such works. Some of the early settlers in southern Indiana, like Posey, had access to local subscription libraries which often owned novels [32, 40, 41, 42].' It is also pos- sible that the novels were read so often and so avidly that they were worn out before their owner's death. CONCLUSION The findings of this study do not support the thesis of those scholars who argue that America's pioneers aban- doned books and reading for a primi- tivistic existence in nature's garden. Nor does this study support the Turner thesis, for the Hoosier pioneer's library does not reflect an imaginative, individ- ualistic, or particularily "American" character. Instead, the analysis presented above shows that the pattern of book owner- ship on the southern Indiana frontier was not unlike that revealed by similar studies of earlier American frontiers: a sizable proportion of the estates inven- toried contained books; book collections were generally small, conservative, and "purposeful"; theology was the subject most widely represented in the collec- tions, and the portion of the collections classed as belles lettres increased as the size of the collections increased. Clearly, books were widely available in the homes of Indiana's first settlers. Of course, the fact that a person owned a book does not necessarily mean that he read it, but it does, in a time when books were expensive and fairly difficult to acquire, suggest his reading interests. 8 The neglect of American authors is illustrated by the fact that the dictionary produced by America's most fervent literary nationalist, Noah Webster, was listed in only two of the libraries analyzed while the dictionary prepared by the Englishman John Walker was located in thirty of the collections. 9 Actual records of the books borrowed from libraries in early Indiana are scarce. Fielding Beeler, who lived in Marion County, as a young man kept a record of the books he borrowed from the County Library in 1845 [43]. David Mc- Donald, a Kentuckian transplanted to Daviess County, Indiana, remembered borrowing numerous books from the County Library, including the works of Hume, Pope, and Swift and that, "Morn- ings, evenings, and at noon when the horses were resting from the plough, I devoured these volumes [44, p. 1801." Novels were frequently checked out of the Indiana State Library by members of the legislative and executive branches of government. A number of thick folio circulation books record- ing all loans prior to 1850 are available in the Indiana State Library Archives Division. The early settlers could, and often did, borrow books from one another. There are occasional references in diaries to such practices. Evidence of such borrow- ing is also present in the numerous advertisements placed in local papers requesting the return of a borrowed book. One such note read: "Borrowed Books. The Subscriber requests those persons who have borrowed books from him to return them as soon as their convenience will permit." It was signed William Henry Harrison (Western Sun [Vincennes], July 20, 1811).
