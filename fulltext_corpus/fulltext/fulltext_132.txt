Literature Review Library and information services to Native American populations in the United States have been an issue of concern to librarians and policy makers for the past several decades.2 While there have been studies on library and information centers that serve Native American clientele, no systematic study of the patterns of library use among the Native American population has yet appeared. This article uses data from the U.S. Current Population Survey (October 2002, School Enrollment/Library Use Supplement) to explore how Native Americans are using public libraries and some factors that affect their use [1]. The importance of this study is that it examines both how Native American households use public libraries and what factors contribute to higher use rates. An understanding of these factors could be useful to groups that are working to increase Native American access to library and information services. Historically, Native Americans, particularly those living on reservations, have had insufficient access to library and information resources. About one‐third to one‐half of the approximately 2 million Native Americans in the United States live on reservations, and of those on reservations, one‐half of them live on the ten largest reservations in the western part of the country [2, 3]. Most of the remainder live neither on nor near any tribal government jurisdiction [4]. Many issues pertaining to library services for Native Americans differ depending on whether reservation or nonreservation residents are being discussed. For Native Americans on reservations, a lack of a nearby library is a central concern. For nonreservation Native Americans, the issue is whether mainstream public libraries have taken steps to be welcoming to this population. 2.  The data used in this study are from a branch of the U.S. Census Bureau. The terminology used by the Census Bureau for this racial category is “American Indian, Aleut, Eskimo.” In the literature the terms “Native American,” “American Indian,” and “Alaska Natives” are all commonly used. In this article, “Native American” will be used as a general term to cover all people that fall into this census category, while “Indian” or “American Indian” will be used when referring to native populations in the “lower forty‐eight” U.S. states. To refer specifically to the native people in Alaska, the term “Alaskan Natives” will be used. A Brief History of Library Services to Native Americans Before the 1960s, scant attention was paid in the library literature to the information needs of Native Americans [5]. The general assumption was that Indians not living on reservations were assimilated into the majority population and had no specialized information needs that were not being met and that Indians on reservations were served by libraries in Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schools or mission schools [6]. There was some recognition in the library literature as early as 1935 that reservation libraries were inadequate, for Margaretta Barr noted that Indian school libraries were often neglected and without trained library staff. She also stated that books sent to Indian schools were frequently not on subjects that were interesting to the Indians but were books that were intended to “improve” them [7]. This reflected the ongoing professional debate of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries about whether the purpose of libraries was either to “lift up” the patrons to a higher social standing by providing materials meant to “better” the readers or to provide for readers' actual information and recreational needs [8, 9]. Lucy Ann Babcock’s 1935 assertion that reservation Indians were not the responsibility of public libraries partially stems from the structure of library politics and economics [6]. Public libraries are generally supported by the community tax base. It is not unusual for public libraries to require proof of community residency in order for a patron to obtain a library card. Reservation Indians did not pay taxes to the nearby towns and were not considered members of those communities, so the libraries did not define them as part of their clientele base. In addition, state library agencies did not embrace reservations as part of their responsibility because Indian reservations are politically separate from the states in which they are located; therefore, they were not included in the state library system [10]. Lotsee Patterson states that even now many tribal libraries have no ties to state agencies or library systems [2]. This can be problematic when applying for funding because tribal libraries are often not perceived to be “real” public libraries [11]. It also leads to tribal librarians being isolated from peers and professional support [5, 12]. The development of library services to Indians is linked to the social history of the United States. The Bureau of Indian Affairs was established in 1849, and tribal governments were first recognized in the 1930s [4]. Cheryl Duran states that federal control of Indian education began in 1870, and various attempts at Indian colleges were made in the early 1880s [13]. The education of Indians was predominately controlled by religious institutions, such as mission schools, or the BIA. Some libraries did exist on reservations in the early to mid‐1900s, but those libraries were used almost exclusively by the Anglos who were living on the reservations [14]. The first actual Indian‐run reservation library was established in Arizona in 1958 by the Colorado River Tribe [15–17]. Around this same time period Anglos began to become interested in establishing library service to Indians, and this resulted in a variety of bookmobile services and small deposit collections being established on reservations from the late 1950s and into the mid‐to‐late 1960s [15, 18, 19]. These early efforts were scattered, with no state coordination [10]. While outreach was a step in the right direction, the label of “disadvantaged” patrons continued to marginalize groups of users, and “outreach” defined them as something outside the norm [20]. Additionally, many early collections were established from donations that did not meet the needs and interests of the Indians [21, 22]. Later literature also stated that outside agencies deciding for the Indians what they needed were patronizing and that their efforts were not well received, and it emphasized that librarians hoping to reach Indian clientele must include Indians in the decision‐making processes of establishing collections and programs [10, 18, 20, 23]. Other problems in establishing reservation libraries included a lack of funding, Indians’ justified lack of trust toward Anglos, inadequate facilities, and a lack of trained library staff [15, 23–30]. There were also language gaps between Native patrons and Anglo librarians, a lack of appropriate published material, and literacy issues, particularly among patrons of the older generations [6, 7, 15, 18, 19, 25, 26, 31–33]. The concept of deposits of written material was foreign to cultures that historically relied on oral traditions, and this also contributed to difficulties in early library program coordination [34]. The development of libraries in Alaska for Alaskan Native groups was different from that in other states of the United States. In 1982, Alaska created a State Public Library Assistance Grant program that provided grants to rural communities to start public libraries. The program was not without its own difficulties, but in general it did provide for the establishment of quite a number of village libraries [30]. Many issues with supplying library service to Alaskan Native villages were similar to issues with supplying library service to American Indians in other states; in particular, remote locations, cultural barriers, and language issues made providing information services challenging [33]. In fact, library and information service issues faced by American Indians and Alaskan Natives have much in common with those faced by other indigenous native people around the world. Canadian Indians use libraries on reservations, but “rural off‐reserve and urban public libraries are not used as frequently for reasons including language barriers, exclusion and inadequate collections” [20, p. 254]. Reegan Breu states that band and tribal libraries feel welcoming to Aboriginal people, while mainstream libraries “evoke feelings of alienation” and remind Aboriginal people of their “experiences of marginalization” [20, p. 255]. Indigenous Australians face similar issues in library use and access. Historically excluded from libraries, Indigenous Australians find mainstream libraries to contain much material on Indigenous people and cultures that is offensive, biased, and demeaning [35]. In a study of Canada, Greenland, the former Soviet Union, present‐day Russia, the United States, and Northern Scandinavia, Gordon Hill focused on library development of Native people who come from traditionally oral cultures. These Native people commonly have low social status, endemic economic poverty, and scattered populations, and to them “libraries are, at least initially, foreign, ethnocentric, irrelevant and subversive” [33, pp. xii–xiii]. He notes that Native populations migrating into towns and cities is a worldwide trend, with over one‐half of Native people living in urban centers, predominately in larger cities [33, p. 94]. Library Services to Native Americans Today Public library services to American Indians have greatly evolved over the past several decades [15, 27, 30]. From the early 1970s through the early 1990s, understanding of the information needs of Native American populations matured [15, 24]. This time period saw the founding of a great number of tribal libraries, the establishment of several tribal colleges with libraries, the shifting of responsibility for educational facilities from the BIA to the tribes themselves, and the establishment of the American Indian Library Association. A 1980 survey showed that at that time about fifty of the 300 tribes in the lower forty‐eight states had established tribal libraries, while in 1994 another survey indicated approximately one‐half of these 300 tribes had established some kind of reservation library services [15, 27]. Public library collections on reservations are generally now referred to as tribal libraries. These libraries are often part of tribal community services and are sometimes combined with K–12 libraries or community college libraries on the reservation [12, 36]. Several authors write that tribal libraries have unique ideological frameworks in that their mission includes cultural survival and promotion of the self‐determination of Indians [11, 12, 18, 37–39]. Part of what these authors are emphasizing is the focus of collecting culturally accurate and culturally sensitive materials by and about Native American individuals and concerning tribe‐specific information and customs. Partly they are referring to the cultural preservation mission illustrated by the collection and display of historical photos, pottery, and other artistic works; recordings and videos of elders sharing memories and folklore; story times with Native storytellers; and other involvement with cultural artifacts and the transmission of tribal culture. Tribal libraries are often more than libraries, additionally functioning as cultural and community centers and social gathering places [28]. Preservation of languages is of central concern [21]. Collections reflect the diversity of Native American groups and highlight Native American contributions and Native American life [30]. Tribal libraries’ roles in the knowledge management of tribal history and culture are especially served by preserving the knowledge of the tribal elders who are living libraries of culture, history, and language. It is vital to record and store this knowledge for future generations [36, 38, 40]. Audiotaping or videotaping of traditional storytellers is one advocated way to preserve traditional culture [18, 40]. Tribal libraries also serve an important archival function in coordinating the storage of tribal historical documents, government regulations, treaties, and agreements [38, 41]. As sovereign entities, tribes must have access to legal materials for the tribal lawyers and officials [15]. For Native Americans who do not live on reservations, there are still barriers to library and information services. Published materials on Native Americans, particularly materials published before the Civil Rights Era, are full of biases and inaccuracies [20]. Biases are also inherent in mainstream libraries; for example, circulation policies are based on concepts that are foreign to Native American cultures [15, 30, 40]. Since many mainstream public libraries do not have appropriate materials or cultural sensitivity, Native Americans have found them to be alienating. They perceive that these libraries are not for them, that there will not be materials of interest to them, and that they will not be welcome [20, 28, 42]. To try to serve their Native American clientele, several cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles, and Milwaukee [43, 44], have created programs to make their libraries more welcoming. Decentralization of the Native American population in cities can make reaching these patrons more problematic. Libraries such as the Gallup, New Mexico, library, with its Native American Day, and the Los Angeles Public Library, with its outreach at powwows, have found that linking library services to Indian cultural events is an effective means of appealing to this patron group [44, 45]. For the most part, Native Americans have the same kinds of information needs as other rural and urban residents [25]. They turn to libraries to support their educational pursuits and their hobbies, to improve job‐seeking skills, and to find health‐related information [10]. Much of the earlier literature stated that librarians noticed that Indians, particularly Indian children, had a special interest in materials about Indians [6, 7, 25, 46]. By the 1970s, many articles were pointing out that much of the published literature was inaccurate or biased and that many Anglos did not understand that there were vast cultural differences between different Indian tribes. Nor did they understand Native American library needs [26, 28, 31]. Early programs found it difficult to identify significant numbers of books of interest to Indian children. Irene Peck noted that the books needed to be about familiar things in their lives [19]. There began to be a call for materials written by Indians about Indians [23, 47]. Small presses were more likely to publish this kind of material, and collection development librarians for Native collections were urged to be familiar with these small presses [11, 39]. As early as 1935, Barr mentioned that librarians needed to pay attention to the tribe when providing library service, and Biggs reiterated this in 1998 [6, 7]. In addition to collecting appropriate materials, Barr advocated that library services to Indian children should include storytelling [7]. By the 1990s, many tribal libraries were recording and transcribing oral histories and traditional storytellers to capture culturally accurate information [40]. Libraries are not only important for their ability to provide physical materials such as books, as “Native Americans rank far below the national average in their access to telephones, computers, and the Internet” [48]. For example, in 2000, households with telephones in the United States were 94.6 percent of all households. But in the Navajo Nation the household telephone rate was only 37.4 percent [49]. While many tribal schools have computers, they are often few in number and have limited Internet connectivity [50]. So in addition to using libraries for materials, many Native Americans go to public libraries to use computers and connect to the Internet [28]. A National Telecommunications Information Administration report from 1999 showed that Native Americans were more likely to access the Internet at schools and libraries than any other group [15]. Although public libraries often fulfill the Internet needs of community residents, this is not always the case. In the Four Corners region of the Southwest, the Gates Foundation decided to install the majority of their computer/Internet stations in locations other than libraries, as it was determined that other locations would be more useful for reservation residents [49]. Great strides have been made in the past several decades to rectify inequities of access to information resources for Native Americans. Is there still a need to increase library and information services for Native Americans both on and off reservations? This study compares Native American households to Anglo households on rates of public library use and examines factors that might affect those rates. It also compares which public library services are being used by these groups. Methodology The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a household sample survey that is conducted several months out of the year by the U.S. Bureau of the Census to collect labor‐force data. In addition to these data, other information is occasionally gathered by including supplemental questions. Data for the present study were collected with the CPS October 2002, School Enrollment/Library Use supplement. The sample universe for the CPS is the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population living in households. The sampling method is a multistage probability sample of approximately 56,000 households from all fifty states and the District of Columbia, and data are gathered using a series of structured, closed‐ended questions. Households are selected, and then data are gathered about all persons in the household. One person in the household becomes the “reference person” and answers questions for all members of the household if possible. The reference person must be fifteen years of age or older. Since households are chosen, and not individuals or families, data are gathered about all household members no matter their relationships to each other. Census Bureau summaries are often presented as population estimates. This is achieved through the construction of weighting variables that adjust age, race, sex, Hispanic origin, and state of residence to make the sample population more closely resemble the distribution of these characteristics in the entire population as reflected in the population censuses. In this study the decision was made to not use weighting variables and instead to present these data as percentages and not population estimates. Weighting was done during initial data analysis for comparative purposes, but for most analyses the difference with the weights and without the weights was negligible. The data in this article were analyzed using multilayer cross‐tabulations using various subsets of the data set. It was unknown how these intense manipulations might affect the accuracy of the weights, so in the final analyses for this article the weighting variables were not used. These data are from a probability sample that comes with an assumption of generalizability to the population. However, since weighting was not included in the final analyses, these data are presented as percentages of the sample distribution, and caution is advised in generalizing these results to the entire population. Some of the questions asked by the CPS concerned each individual in the household, such as education level, age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, and relationship to the reference person. Other questions were asked about the household, such as: “Is there a telephone in the household?” All of the library use questions were asked of the household and not of individuals in the household. It is therefore not possible to determine which individuals in a household used the public library in the past month, only whether anyone in the household used the library. These data, however, were recorded in the data set as individual‐level data. So if the reference person reported that somebody in the household used the public library in the last month, each person in the household was marked “yes” on the questionnaire. To apply group data to individuals is an ecological fallacy, so since the library questions were asked at a household level (“Did anyone from your household use the library”), only one person representing the household could be used for data analysis. Otherwise large households would have more weight in the analysis than small households, and the data analysis results would be skewed. Consequently, the information of the reference person was used to represent the household. Library Use Questions Following is a list of the survey questions. The instructions read, “These next questions are about your household’s use of public libraries. This does not include school or college libraries, or special research libraries” [1]. 1. L1. About how far would you say it is from your home to the closest public library? Would you say: Less than 1 mile, 1 or 2 miles, 3 to 5 miles, 6 to 10 miles, More than 10 miles. 2. L2. In the past month, that is since (MONTH), (DAY), has any member of your household used a public library or bookmobile for any reason? Yes (Skip to L4), No (Go to PROBE). 3. PROBE. How about to borrow materials, take a class, to use the computers, or for activities for children? Yes (Go to L4), No (Skip to L3). 4. L3. Has anyone in your household used a public library or bookmobile in the past year, that is since October, 2001? Yes (Go to L4), No. All of the following questions had answer categories of Yes/No and were asked of respondents who answered Yes to L2 or PROBE. 5. L4. Did this person use the library … to borrow books, cds, or tapes? 6. L5. To use a computer or the internet? 7. L6. To learn how to use a computer or the internet? 8. L7.

To get information for personal use, such as consumer or health issues, investments, and so on? 20. L19. For enjoyment or hobbies? Data Preparation The data set contained 159,887 respondents of which 2,102 were Native American. There were 57,148 households in the sample; 43,116 were households of Anglo (white, non‐Hispanic) respondents. In order to facilitate data analysis, a separate data set was created containing households with Native American respondents. These raw data were then examined to determine the character of the households and to create variables such as whether the household was all Native Americans or whether it was a mixed‐race household with some Native Americans. Then this data set was further reduced to one representative person from each household. The full data set was gone through line by line, and households were assigned a race/ethnicity designation that encompassed all race/ethnicities in the household. For this article the designation Anglo was given to households whose residents were all white, non‐Hispanic. In order to set up the data set to analyze Native American households, a definition of what that would mean had to be devised. There were 929 households containing Native American respondents, but some of those households were eliminated from the study as only peripherally representative. Eliminated were households in which both parents were non–Native American but one or more child under age 18 or foster child was Native American. These were eliminated on the justification that adults make the decisions and set the tone for the household. In a few situations, a non–Native American parent and an adult Native American child lived together. Those households were included as mixed‐race households. Mixed‐race households of unrelated roommates were eliminated on the ground that there is no implied unity of actions of unrelated adults living together. However, households of adult roommates of all Native Americans were included since all of the respondents in the household were Native American. Also included were households in which one spouse was Native American and the other spouse was of a different race. After irrelevant households were eliminated there were a total of 839 households in the Native American sample. These were divided into 471 households that were all Native American and 368 households that were mixed race but with at least one adult who was Native American. Both Hispanic and non‐Hispanic Native Americans were included. Of the Native American respondents, 12 percent also reported Hispanic origin. On Race and Ethnic Diversity Race is a social and cultural concept and not a scientific absolute. Examining data from the racial category of Native American implies assumptions about a shared social experience of people listed in that category. There is not a uniform and accepted definition of who falls within the category of American Indian/Alaskan Native [27]. In a study that relies on self‐reporting of race, it is not possible for the researcher to determine “how Native American” the respondent is, so she must take the self‐report at face value. Degrees of assimilation of individuals into the mainstream culture vary [23]. There is a great deal of cultural diversity between Native American tribes [31, 40, 51]. However, in the literature, Native American library experience has been rolled into an overarching general trend of insufficient service due to some combination of the following issues: biased materials, needs for tribe‐specific information, specialized Indian information needs pertaining to legal and treaty issues, needs for cultural preservation and accurate information about Indians, feelings of being unwelcome in Anglo libraries, and—for those living on reservations—long distances to libraries. There has been some literature aimed at specific geographic regions, particularly the Navajo and other tribes living in the Four Corners region of the United States [19, 25, 29, 45, 46, 49]. It has also been pointed out that Alaskan Natives’ experience has varied from that of Indians in the lower forty‐eight states [27]. California Indians also face special challenges due to urban environments and the migration to California by many Indians from midwestern and southwestern tribes [44]. In the study sample, one‐half of the Native American households were located in just five states: California, Alaska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. Since three of these states were also highlighted in the literature as areas with quite specific library situations for their Native populations, some analysis examines responses from those areas. The bulk of the analysis examines trends of Native Americans households without regard to geographic region. Anglo households were used as a measure of mainstream public library use against which Native American household use was compared. Without such a point of comparison usage rates would be examined in a vacuum. This comparison gives a framework of what levels of use might be considered average for U.S. society in general. Limitations of the Study This study uses quantitative methods applied to a very large data set of U.S. government data. These data were not originally gathered for this study; therefore, the methodology used is not a perfect fit for the current analysis. The main drawback to these data is that the library use question was asked at the household level and not the individual level. Additionally, there were no questions asking if respondents lived on reservations or with what tribe they were affiliated. No conclusions can be made about any particular tribe or comparing Native Americans living on reservations to those living off reservations. Both qualitative and quantitative methods have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the best research projects include both types of analysis. This study has a strength in its very large sample size and rigorous data collection methods. All responses were closed‐ended, however, and no qualitative analyses were possible. As this is the case, only general patterns are discernible. Analyses of individual motivations or reasoning cannot be determined without a qualitative data component. Data Analysis In the analysis Native American households were compared to mixed‐race households and Anglo households to see if there was a difference in use based on the race of the household. The hypotheses concerning this comparison were created from the literature and were 1. Native American households use public libraries less than do Anglo households. 2. Native American households use some services of libraries more than do Anglo households. Nothing in the literature discussed mixed‐race Native American households, so it was unclear how these households would use libraries. Mixed‐race households were separated out on the hypothesis that 3.  Mixed‐race households’ use of public libraries differs from that of both Anglo and Native American households. The literature also suggested that library use by Native Americans would be different in different geographic regions. This became the hypothesis: 4.  The use of libraries by Native American and other households differs by state. Based on literature not about Native American library use in particular, the following hypothesis dealt with how other independent variables affect library use: 5.  Socioeconomic and geographic variables affect the use of public libraries. Data pertaining to these variables were examined with percentages and chi‐square for independent groups. While percentages give an indication of differences between groups, the chi‐square tests the significance of the difference and is used to reject the possibility that the difference between groups is the result of chance only. Chi‐square is the appropriate statistical test for nominal‐level data and two independent groups. The chi‐square was calculated using frequencies in \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $2\times 2$ \end{document} contingency tables and tested for significance at the .05 level, a chi‐square of greater than 3.841. In the one case where significance was reached when the expected frequency of a cell was less than five, the Yates Correction for Continuity was employed and resulted in a rejection of the significance of that particular comparison [52]. The third kind of analysis that was done was a stepwise multiple regression on Native American household use of public libraries with a variety of independent variables. This type of regression ranks independent variables as to which are the best predictors of change on a dependent variable [53]. Data Analysis Results Analysis revealed that people from Native American households were less likely to have used the public library in the past month or the past year than were people from mixed‐race or Anglo households. Using chi‐square tests for independent groups, the differences in library use between Native American versus mixed‐race households, and Native American versus Anglo households, were statistically significant. About one‐quarter of Native American households (25.3 percent: 119 out of 471) compared to about one‐third of mixed‐race (32.4 percent: 118 out of 364) and Anglo (31.0 percent: 13,298 out of 42,945) households reported library use in the past month, while about one‐third of Native American households (37.4 percent: 176 out of 471) compared to about one‐half of mixed‐race (51.6 percent: 188 out of 364) and Anglo (49.2 percent: 21,149 out of 42,945) households reported library use in the past year. How Native Americans use public libraries and factors that may contribute to their comparatively lower usage rates are discussed below. Use of Public Libraries From the literature it was postulated that Native Americans generally use public libraries in the same ways that other people do, with some exceptions. According to the literature, libraries that serve Native Americans, particularly tribal libraries, participate in cultural preservation by providing materials in Native languages, and tribal members go to the library to use these language resources. Indian children from reservations are more likely to use public libraries for schoolwork because they are often bused long distances to school and cannot stay after school to use the library [28]. Also, tribal libraries sometimes have blended roles that include acting as public libraries, K–12 libraries, and/or college libraries [12, 36]. The literature urges libraries that serve Native Americans to have materials to help them find jobs or improve job skills, so it was expected that this would be an area in which Native Americans would have higher usage rates [10]. Other studies indicate that Native Americans are more likely to use computers and the Internet at the library than are Anglos since they are less likely to have computers and telephone lines in their homes [28, 48]. The literature also states that libraries that serve Native Americans feature Native storytellers in order to pass on tribal oral traditions. Of the households that reported using the public library in the past month, several questions were asked concerning which library services were utilized. The following percentages are only of those households that reported library use, and not of the number of households overall. The sample sizes for this section are 119 Native American households, 118 mixed‐race households, and 13,298 Anglo households. It is not statistically problematic to compare percentages across vastly different sample sizes because it is the percentage that is being compared, not the frequency. As the literature predicted, Native American households were much more likely to use public libraries for non–English language materials than were Anglo households. Of Native American households that reported use of public libraries in the past month, 13.4 percent borrowed materials in languages other than English. Only 2.5 percent of mixed‐race and 3.7 percent of Anglo households borrowed non–English language materials. Using chi‐square, the difference between Native American versus mixed‐race households, and Native American versus Anglo households, on the use of non–English language material was statistically significant. All three household types used English as a Second Language (ESL) programs and literacy programs a negligible amount, from less than 1 to 2.5 percent. The use of ESL programs and literacy programs were not significantly different between household types (see fig. 1). Fig. 1.— Use of public library by household composition As the literature predicted, Native American households (42.0 percent) were more likely to report using the public library for school or class assignments than were Anglo households (26.6 percent). Mixed‐race households (39.0 percent) were closer to Native American households than were Anglo households on this item. Native American households were slightly more likely, about five percentage points, than Anglo households to use the public library for information to help find a job, to do work assignments, or to keep up‐to‐date at work, but none of the household groups reported high rates of using the library for employment‐related reasons. On all three of these uses the difference between Native American versus Anglo households was statistically significant, but the difference between Native American versus mixed‐race households was not significant (see fig. 2). Fig. 2.— Use of public library by household composition Did lack of a telephone in the household correlate with public library use of computers or the Internet? When all households in the data set that reported library use in the past month were examined ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=53,637$ \end{document} ), the lack of a telephone did correspond to a much higher likelihood of using computers or the Internet at the public library.3 For 52,162 households that had telephones, 27.5 percent used computers or the Internet at the public library. For the 1,475 households that did not have telephones, 40.9 percent used computers or the Internet at the public library. Since the question that was asked in the survey combined “computer or Internet,” it is not possible to determine if this increased use was specifically Internet use, or if the lack of a telephone in the household was related to a lack of computer in the household, so patrons were using library computers for purposes other than accessing the Internet. This phenomenon of the “digital divide” of unequal access to computers and the Internet is well known and widely discussed in the information studies literature. What is important to this study is how this divide applies to Native American versus Anglo households. The number of Native American households without telephones that reported using computers or the Internet at the public library was too small to do a meaningful analysis. However, Native Americans overall did use computers or the Internet at the public library at nearly twice the rate of Anglos, at 24.4 percent of Anglo households versus 42.9 percent of Native American households, a statistically significant difference. Additionally, Native American households were less likely to report having a telephone in the household (85.8 percent of 471) than were Anglo households (96.6 percent of 43,116). In some regions this difference was even greater: only 67.2 percent of Native American households in New Mexico reported having a telephone ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=58$ \end{document} ). Overall there was a statistically significant difference in having a telephone in the household between Native American versus Anglo, and between Native American versus mixed‐race households. None of the household types in this study reported a high rate of learning how to use the computer (computer literacy) at the public library (a range of 3.7–7.6 percent across household types), but the difference between Native American and Anglo households was statistically significant (see fig. 3). Fig. 3.— Use of public library and telephone in household by household composition Since programs for children would be unlikely to be attended by households with no children, the question about using the public library for programs for children and teens was calculated only for those households with children ages 17 and younger. The question concerning using programs for persons ages 55 and older was calculated only for households in which the reference person was age 55 or older. There was a negligible difference between the rates at which Native American ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=71$ \end{document} ), mixed‐race ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=78$ \end{document} ), and Anglo ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=5,944$ \end{document} ) households used library programs for children under age 13 in the past month. About one‐fifth (from 16.9 to 21.8 percent) of all household types reported using these programs for younger children. Mixed‐race households were twice as likely (10.2 percent) as Anglo (4.9 percent) and about one‐third more likely than Native American households (7.0 percent) to use programs for teens ages 13–18. Programs for seniors ages 55 and older were used by 16.7 percent of Native American ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=18$ \end{document} ) and 10.5 percent of Anglo ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=4,100$ \end{document} ) households.

None of the differences between household types on these questions were statistically significant; most likely, this is partially because the numbers of Native American and mixed‐race households that answered this question were very small and chi‐square is vulnerable to sample size. The survey question concerning programs for children under age 13 specified “such as a story hour.” While programs for children were more popular overall than other age‐specific programs, Native American households were least likely to have attended these in the past month. The literature emphasized that Native storytellers are an important and utilized resource, especially for tribal libraries, so it was expected that Native Americans would have a higher use of this type of program. It is not possible to determine from these data why this use by Native American households was less than predicted in the literature. Some possible explanations for the lower than expected percentage could be that Native storytellers, while an important resource, are not widespread in children’s programs or that the respondents in this study were using libraries other than tribal libraries—or it could be because the question specified “in the past month.” Perhaps if the question were asked “in the past year” the numbers would be higher (see fig. 4). Fig. 4.— Use of public library by household composition For other types of library use, Native American, mixed‐race, and Anglo households all showed comparable use rates. Over 80 percent of households used the library to borrow materials, over 60 percent used it for enjoyment or hobbies, about one‐third used it to find information for personal use, and a few borrowed materials for people with disabilities or attended meetings, lectures, or discussions. This supports the assertion in the literature that for the most part Native Americans used libraries in the same ways as other groups. In these types of library use the only statistically significant difference was between Native American and Anglo households on use for enjoyment or hobbies, where Anglos were significantly more likely to use public libraries for this purpose (see fig. 5). Fig. 5.— Use of public library by household composition Of the households in the survey that reported public library use in the past month, the use patterns of Native Americans versus Anglos were very similar to what was predicted in the literature. Native Americans and Anglos were equally likely to engage in most types of library use. Types of use in which Native Americans were more likely to engage included borrowing non–English language materials, doing class work, using computers or the Internet, and (slightly more likely) job‐related uses. Overall, however, Native American households were much less likely to have used a public library in the previous month or the previous year than were other households. The next section of the article will discuss socioeconomic and demographic factors that affect the use of public libraries and will compare the distribution of Native American, mixed‐race, and Anglo households on those factors. 3.  This is for all of the households total and is not divided by race. Socioeconomic and Regional Factors That Affect Use of Public Libraries A number of library use studies were conducted in the past approximately fifty years examining demographic predictors of library use. In a comparison of sixteen such studies, education level was the strongest predictor of library use, with other socioeconomic variables such as income and occupation proving to be weak predictors. Sex, race, and marital status were not important predictors of library use, while age was related with use in a curvilinear fashion, increasing to a certain point then decreasing [54]. Other studies found that the presence of school‐aged children, family size, county size, and respondents’ perception that they lived close to a library were effective predictors of library use [55–58]. This study will examine several independent variables that might affect library use, including the education level of the household reference person, family income, the population density of the household location, and the household distance from the public library. According to data from the Statistical Abstract of the United States, Native Americans are nearly three times as likely (25.7 percent) to live below the poverty line as whites (9.1 percent). They have the lowest median family income of any race group and have the lowest rates of high school graduation and attainment of college degrees [59]. How does this affect library use? Education Level of Household Adults.— The head of the household was not identified in these data, so the reference person was used to represent the head of the household. This education question was limited to reference persons 25 years or older. The Census Bureau also uses the age of 25 years when it calculates the highest education attained for adults, so this cutoff is supported by convention. For all of the reference persons in the data set age 25 or older, a very clear correlation can be seen between education level and the likelihood that somebody in the household used the public library in the past month.4 Analysis shows a steady increase in public library use from households where the reference person has less than a high school diploma (16.1 percent) to households where the reference person has a graduate degree (46.0 percent; \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=42,440$ \end{document} ). If education level of the household reference person has such a strong impact on the household's use of libraries, how does the education level of Native American adults compare to that of Anglo adults? When calculated for all the adults ages 25 and older in the data set, one‐quarter of Native American adults (24.0 percent out of 1,088), twice the rate of Anglos (13.1 percent out of 80,187), had completed less than a high school education. Equal proportions of both Native Americans and Anglos had completed high school (32.9 and 33.6 percent) and attended some college (26.3 and 29.0 percent). Anglos were much more likely to have completed bachelor’s or graduate degrees (27.6 percent bachelor’s and graduate combined) than had Native Americans (13.3 percent combined). When the effects of education level on the use of public libraries is applied across racial composition of households, the trend remains constant that the education level of the household reference person strongly affects the household's use of public libraries. The increased use by educational level is dramatic. For Native American households, those with a reference person at the lowest educational attainment had a library use rate of 12.2 percent, but households with a reference person at the highest educational attainment had a use rate of 54.0 percent, a change of 41.8 percentage points. Anglo households showed less gain per education level, from 14.1 percent to 43.4 percent, a change of 29.3 percentage points. Mixed‐race households showed a 29.2 percentage point change. Native American and Anglo households were roughly equivalent in use rates by education level until the bachelor's level and above, where Native American households were about 11 percent more likely than Anglo households to report public library use. This difference among Anglo, mixed‐race, and Native American households was not statistically significant using a chi‐square comparison, so, overall, all households had the same use per education level pattern. In summary, the education level of the household reference person had a strong effect on the likelihood of the household's use of public libraries in the previous month regardless of the race of the household (see fig. 6). Fig. 6.— Used public library in past month by education level and household composition 4.  This is for the entire data set and is not limited by race. Family Income.— The Statistical Abstract of the United States reports that Native American households have the lowest median family income of all racial groups [59]. In the current data set, one‐third of Anglo households reported an annual family income of $60,000 or more. Over one‐quarter of mixed‐race households (28.0 percent) also fell into this category. But only 7.7 percent of Native American households had family incomes of $60,000 or more. Additionally, Native Americans averaged more people living in the household than did Anglos. Only one‐third (35.3 percent) of Anglo households had three or more persons living in the household compared to one‐half (50.3 percent) of Native American households. This means that, per capita, the family income discrepancy between Native Americans and Anglos was even higher. When all the households in the data set were compared on family income and use of the public library in the past month, there was a very clear progression, as family income increased the likelihood of using the public library.5 Of those with the lowest incomes, 18–20 percent used the public library in the past month. For those with the highest incomes, 41.4 percent reported use ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=47,334$ \end{document} ). When family income and library use was modified by the racial composition of household, Native Americans and Anglos reported exactly parallel use rates, from 20 percent for families with incomes of $14,999 or less per year to nearly 40 percent for those making $50,000 per year or higher. Mixed‐race households appeared to vary slightly from this pattern, but chi‐square analysis showed this difference was not statistically significant. It can be concluded, therefore, that the effects of family income on the household rates of public library use are comparable across the race of households. It is important to note that education level and family income are highly correlated, so the effects of these two variables on library use are related (see fig. 7). Fig. 7.— Used public library in past month by family income and household composition 5.  Family income was used since no variables were available with household income. Central City, Metropolitan, and Rural Locations of Households.— Does the population density of the household location have an effect on whether people use public libraries? The Census Bureau identifies three types of population densities: metropolitan area inside central city, metropolitan area outside central city, and nonmetropolitan area. The metropolitan areas are statistically derived categories developed for use by federal agencies. Metropolitan areas consist of one or more central counties and their surrounding areas with a minimum population of 50,000–100,000 depending upon the region of the country [60]. For the following discussion, these areas are called central city, metropolitan, and rural. Native American, mixed‐race, and Anglo households were found at different rates in these three types of locations. Native American households were most likely to be located in rural areas (62.0 percent), and Anglo households were least likely to be rurally situated (34.4 percent). Mixed‐race households fell between at 45.9 percent located rurally. Conversely, nearly one‐half of Anglo households (45.3 percent) were in metropolitan areas, while only 18.6 percent of Native American households were so situated. Households of all three racial categories were about equally likely to be located in central cities—at around 20 percent. Analysis showed that household location in a central city, metropolitan, or rural area had a minimal effect on library use in the past month. Within racial groupings, households had similar use percentages whatever the type of location. There was a small location effect for Anglo households, with library use ranging from 27.7 percent in rural areas to 34.0 percent in metropolitan areas. Mixed‐race households showed little variation, from 32.3 percent for rural households and 33.3 percent in metropolitan areas to 35.1 percent for those in the central city. Native Americans were least likely to have used the public library in the past month in all three locations, ranging from 24.0 percent in rural areas to 27.8 percent in metropolitan areas. Distance from Public Library.— Is distance from the public library a factor in use of public libraries? When these data were examined for all household reference persons, a clear pattern was established that the likelihood of public library use decreased as distance from the public library increased. While 35.6 percent of households located less than a mile from a public library reported use in the past month, only 19.9 percent that lived more than ten miles away used the public library ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=56,873$ \end{document} ). According to the data, Native American households were three times as likely as Anglo (21.7 percent compared to 7.1 percent) and twice as likely as mixed‐race households (10.2 percent) to be over ten miles from the nearest public library. Does the overall trend of lowered likelihood of use for more distant households apply equally to all racial categories? Based on a comparison of percentages, the use of public libraries by Anglo households decreased steadily as distance increased. For Native American and mixed‐race households, use decreased sharply as distances increased but then leveled off or rose slightly at higher distances. When calculated with chi‐square, however, these differences between household types were not found to be statistically significant; therefore, distance from the public library affected use of the public library similarly across the ethnicity of the household (see fig. 8). Fig. 8.— Used public library in past month by distance from library and household composition. Effects of Independent Variables on Library Use by Native American Households in Multiple Regression Analysis In the previous section the following variables were examined to determine their effect on public library use in the past month: the education level of the household reference person, family income, the population density of household location, and distance from the public library. Three of these variables were found to have an impact on public library use: education level, family income, and distance from the public library. In this section, multiple regression analysis will be conducted to determine the predictive value of these variables on the likelihood of public library use of Native American households. The population density of household location was not used in the regression analysis as it was previously determined to have little correlation to rates of library use. A fourth variable was suggested by the literature and used in the regression: the number of persons in the household. This was coded as a dichotomous variable: one to three persons or four or more persons in the household. Education level was recoded into up through high school versus education beyond high school, family income was recoded into up to $14,999 versus $15,000 and above, and distance to the public library was coded as up to two miles and over two miles. In the regression analysis the variable with the strongest predictive value on the use of public libraries was the education level of the household reference person, which was significant at the .000 level. The next most important variable was distance from the public library. This variable was also significant at the .000 level. The third most useful variable was the number of persons in the household, significant at the .001 level. While income was a significant predictor when calculated independently with library use, it did not add significantly to the regression equation probably because of its high correlation with education level. The R 2 for the prediction equation with education level, distance from the library, and household size was 14.0 percent. Adding family income only raised the R 2 to 14.4 percent. While number of persons in the household was a significant predictor of library use, it is postulated that this is merely because it results in a larger number of potential library users and likely is related to children in the household. When a variable for children ages 17 and under in the household was used in the regression equation instead of number of persons in the household, the children variable was a significant predictor at .016 level but was not as strong of a predictor as the number of persons in the household. It also added less impact to the regression equation than did the number in the household variable. Location of Household and Effect on Use of Libraries Limited analysis can be done of households at the state level because the number of households in the sample gets too small for complicated comparisons to be made by state. However, there are enough Native American households in a few key states to allow a simple look at use of public libraries. The states with the largest number of Native American households in the sample were Alaska ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=71$ \end{document} ), New Mexico ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=58$ \end{document} ), South Dakota ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=40$ \end{document} ), Oklahoma ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=34$ \end{document} ), and California ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=30$ \end{document} ).

New Mexico had only six mixed‐race households in the sample, and South Dakota had thirteen. As Native Americans were the focus of this study, the five states with the largest number of Native American households in the sample were compared, using their public library use in the past month and in the past year. In the literature, Alaska, New Mexico, and California were particularly singled out as states that had special circumstances applying to their Native American populations and library access. For the calculations in the discussion below, the numbers of Anglo households in these states were Alaska (533), California (1,895), New Mexico (293), Oklahoma (600), and South Dakota (875). See figures 9 and 10 for this section’s discussion. Fig. 9.— Used public library in past month by state and household composition Fig. 10.— Used public library in past year by state and household composition For the previous month, Alaska had the highest use rates for all household composition types, at about one‐third for each group. When use for the past year was examined, however, the percentage of Native American households was about the same as that for the past month, slightly over one‐third. However, both mixed‐race and Anglo households increased their use rates dramatically to 64.4 percent for mixed‐race households and 58.3 percent for Anglo households for the previous year. So, while Native American households used the library in the past month at a higher rate than did the other households, if they had not used it in the past month they were unlikely to have used the public library in the past year. In fact, the differences between households in Alaska on library use in the past month were not significant with chi‐square, but the difference on use in the past year was significantly different between Native American versus Anglo, and Native American versus mixed‐race households. Of these five states, Native Americans in Alaska were most likely to live less than a mile from the public library: 50.7 percent of households. It is likely that their monthly household use rate is so high because of library proximity. Of the Alaskan Native American households, 84.5 percent of them were situated in rural locations. This, coupled with the high rate of library use, might suggest that they were in villages with village public libraries [30, 33]. A smaller percentage of Anglo and mixed‐race households (62.2 and 56.8 percent, respectively) were located in rural areas compared with Native American households. In California, Native American households were about 10 percent less likely to have used the public library in the past month than were other households (20.0 percent compared to 29.4 percent for mixed‐race and 30.5 percent for Anglo households). However, in the past year in California all household types were equally likely to have used the public library at a rate of nearly one‐half of all Native American, mixed‐race, and Anglo households reporting use (46.7, 44.1, and 47.7 percent, respectively). Using chi‐square, the difference between household types was not significant for library use in the past month or the past year. California has a vastly different population density pattern than Alaska. In California, only 3.6 percent of Native American households, 3.4 percent of mixed‐race households, and 2.0 percent of Anglo households were in rural areas. For all household types, about two‐thirds lived in metropolitan areas and one‐third lived in central cities. In New Mexico there were not enough mixed‐race households to include in the comparison, but about one‐fifth (20.7 percent) of Native American households compared to slightly more than one‐quarter (26.6 percent) of Anglo households had used the public library in the past month. Similar to Alaska, if Native American households had not used the public library in the past month they were unlikely to have used it in the past year, for only one‐quarter (25.9 percent) reported library use in the year. However, Anglo households nearly doubled their use rate when the time span was expanded from a month to a year, with nearly one‐half of households reporting library use in the past year (45.1 percent). The difference between Native American and Anglo households was not significant on use of the library in the past month, but it was significant on library use in the past year. According to the literature, American Indians in New Mexico are likely to live in more isolated, rural settings and have the lowest telephone and electricity rates of anywhere in the nation. In these data, 43.1 percent of Native American households reported living more than ten miles from a public library, compared to 14.7 percent of Anglo households. Also, Anglo households were less than a mile from a public library at nearly twice the rate as Native American households (22.5 percent for Anglo and 12.1 percent for Native American). However, New Mexico is a heavily rural state for both Anglo and Native American households. About one‐half of Anglo (51.2 percent) and two‐thirds of Native American (68.5 percent) households were located rurally in this state. Native American households in Oklahoma used the public library in the past month less than Native American households in any of the states under consideration except South Dakota (17.6 percent in Oklahoma), and, annually, only New Mexico Native American households reported less use (29.4 percent in Oklahoma). Anglo households in Oklahoma both monthly and annually used the public library least often of Anglos in all the states under consideration (25.0 percent monthly and 42.2 percent annually). Anglo and mixed‐race households were approximately 10 percent more likely on a monthly and annual basis to use public libraries than were Native American households in Oklahoma, but this difference was not statistically significant. Oklahoma Native American households were less likely to be located in rural locations than Native American households in Alaska, New Mexico, or South Dakota. One‐half of Native American (50.0 percent) and mixed‐race (52.9 percent) households were rurally located, while one‐third (35.7 percent) of Anglo households were rural. One‐fifth of Native American households (20.6 percent) versus 17.1 percent of mixed‐race and 13.0 percent of Anglo households were more than ten miles from the public library in Oklahoma. South Dakota is an even more rural state than New Mexico. In South Dakota, a full 94.3 percent of Native American and 76.5 percent of Anglo households were situated in rural areas. It is interesting to note, however, that while 72.5 percent of Native American households reported being over ten miles from the closest public library, only 14.6 percent of Anglo households were correspondingly far from their libraries. South Dakota Native American households had the lowest public library use rate for the past month in the states under comparison (15.0 percent) but had the second highest rate of use for the past year (37.5 percent). So on an annual basis, Native Americans in South Dakota seemed to be overcoming their library distance disadvantage, even though their use rate was still lower than that of Anglo households (past month 30.6 percent, past year 48.8 percent). Mixed‐race households for South Dakota were not calculated as there were too few. The comparison by state verifies the assertion in the literature that there is a great deal of diversity in the Native American situation concerning access to library and information sources. Not only do figures 9 and 10 show that Native American household use rates vary by state, but Anglo use rates vary by state as well. More detailed studies concentrating on select geographic locations could give a more complete picture of how family income, education level, distances to libraries, and other regional specifics affect availability and the use of public library and information services. While the rates of use in the past month and in the past year do vary by state, in every instance Native Americans reported less use of public libraries than do Anglos. In some cases this usage difference was only a few percentage points, but in other cases Native American households reported one‐half as much library use as Anglo households. The conclusion that can be drawn is that library services to Native American populations are still lagging behind services to Anglos in all states, when the household is located farther than a mile from the public library, regardless of whether the household is located in a city, metropolitan, or rural area. The effect of state of residence is a complex variable that cannot be adequately explored with this data set since the number of Native American households per state is too small to examine complicated interactions. It is recommended that studies similar to this one be conducted individually in the states with the largest Native American populations and with large sample sizes per state. Those studies can then be compared for a fuller picture of state effect. Conclusions The literature accurately predicted that for many types of library use Native Americans used public libraries similarly to other patrons. Areas in which Native Americans had higher usage rates than Anglos included materials in languages other than English, using the library for schoolwork or class work, and computer/Internet access, and they had marginally higher rates of the use of resources related to jobs and employment. Contrary to predictions in the literature, Native Americans did not attend children’s story times at a higher rate than Anglos. Socioeconomic conditions that are part of larger societal dynamics interact with geographic factors to result in lower library use rates for Native Americans versus Anglos. Native Americans are disproportionately represented in demographic groups that are less likely to be public library users. Two interrelated variables for which lower rates of library use are correlated include education level and family income, and Native Americans have demonstrably lower rates on both of these variables than do Anglos. Geographic factors such as distance from the library and state of residence also affect rates of library use. Tendencies to live far from libraries coupled with the socioeconomic factors mentioned exacerbate the low public library use rates of Native Americans. Solutions to socioeconomic inequity are broader than the venue of public libraries, but as education and income levels increase for Native Americans it is postulated that levels of public library use will also increase. It is difficult to draw conclusions about mixed‐race households from these data. In some of the above analyses—for example, overall public library use in the past month and in the past year—rates for mixed‐race households were similar to those for Anglo households. The family income of mixed‐race households was also more similar to that of Anglo households than to that of Native American households. But in other analyses—for example, using libraries for school and class assignments—mixed‐race household rates of use were closer to those of Native American than those of Anglo households. In some situations or states, mixed‐race household use was higher than that of Anglos and elsewhere was lower than that of Native Americans. The conclusion must be drawn that mixed‐race households introduce a variety of factors that do not fit single‐race social patterns and so affect use of public libraries in unpredictable ways. In this study, in addition to the Native Americans and Anglos who made up the focus of the study, mixed‐race households also included African American and Asian respondents, and that might have introduced additional social factors that were not analyzed here. The character of library use for mixed‐race households has certainly not been predicted by the literature on Native American households. Further research would need to be done on mixed‐race households before any kind of meaningful conclusions could be drawn. Bringing library services closer to Native American households would likely increase usage rates, and in fact groups have been working on this goal of providing convenient library services to Native Americans for decades. Advocates for library services to Native Americans have worked hard and accomplished much in advancing the state of such services over the past thirty‐five years. Federal backing toward accomplishing that goal has been substantial and ongoing. In 2006, the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) awarded over $1.3 million in federal grants to improve Native American library services [61]. In 2007, IMLS is again offering its special grant program Native American Library Services Basic Grants. Continuing advocacy for federal and state funding aimed at supporting libraries on reservations and other programs to bring library services to Native American populations may help to alleviate some problems related to long distances to libraries if received funding is used effectively toward improvement. Additionally, as the literature pointed out, it is also highly desirable for librarians to work with local Native American leaders and community members to design the services and collections to make their libraries responsive to Native American patron needs. Whether library access is an unquestionable good for any population is a philosophical issue. As information agencies libraries have the potential to act in a support capacity for educational endeavors, whether they are independently pursued or more formal types of education. They offer places where people can seek information, entertainment, or a sense of community. If libraries are not equally available to all segments of the population then the opportunities that libraries have the potential for providing are also unequally distributed. The theoretical social value of the library is that it provides everyone with basic access to information. This social value is predicated on the availability of the library, for, with too many barriers to use, potential patrons do not have the option of deciding whether or not to avail themselves of library services. Increasing Native American access to library and information services is part of equalizing opportunities to a population that has experienced unequal and biased treatment at the hands of the dominant society. Recommendations for future research include conducting surveys similar to this one within states with large Native American populations so that large sample sizes within states could be obtained. Studies on Oklahoma and South Dakota would be particularly useful since the literature on Native American library use in those states is slim. Future studies could include questions concerning whether respondents live on reservations. Questions should be asked on an individual, rather than a household, level. Supplementing such quantitative studies with qualitative methods would strengthen and enhance the studies by adding depth and richness. This study and future similar studies can provide librarians and policy makers with information concerning how to continue to improve library and information service to Native Americans.
