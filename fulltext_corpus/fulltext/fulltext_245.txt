Research Record MARY KIM, EDITOR Doctoral Dissertations in Progress For the past two years, the Research Re- cord has reported on the Doctoral Student Research Poster sessions held at the an- nual ALISE conference to highlight doc- toral student research at ALISE-affiliated institutions. This column revives the Re- search Record's initial function: the an- nual listing of dissertations-in-progress. In March 1998, copies of a dissertation- in-progress survey form were mailed to all schools listed as having doctoral programs in the ALISE directory. Messages were posted on JESSE, ASIS-L, and DOCDIS lists announcing the availability of this form; a Web version [http:// www. personal. kent.edu/-mkim/resrecord/dissertc.htm] was also available. Faculty and students were asked to respond and to pass the word. This column contains the first round of responses received from thirty- four doctoral candidates through June 15, 1998. There is relatively little overlap be- tween this listing and the last two poster session columns. Twenty-four of the can- didates providing dissertation-in-pro- gress information had their proposals ap- proved in 1997-98. As the listing grows, trends in methods used will be summarized in this column. Some general observations can be made about these thirty- four dis- sertations in progress. Research ap- proaches are evenly divided: fourteen studies employ quantitative designs; fourteen, qualitative; and six, mixed methods. At least ten of the proposals describe their method as one or more of the following: theoretical, philosophi- cal inquiry; action research; descriptive research; case study; or grounded the- ory. Of the twenty studies employing naturalistic techniques, twelve propose the inductive approach employed in the constant comparison technique as their data analysis strategy. Twelve will use computer software to assist in the quali- tative data analysis, with half of these employing QSR Nud*ist. In this listing, principal data collection techniques are interviews and direct observation. Of the twenty-three employing interviews, sixteen will use semistructured inter- views. Among the fifteen studies using direct observation methods, ten rely on unstructured observation documented by field notes. Ten entries propose a mailed questionnaire. Entries are arranged by program and include the following information, when reported: candidate's name, dissertation title, term/year of proposal approval, chair or cochairs, proposed research method, proposed data collection method, pro- posed data analysis technique, computer- aided qualitative analysis software to be used (italicized), subject headings, e-mail address, and home page address. Doc- toral students and dissertation chairs are encouraged to submit information on approved proposals as soon as avail- able. Students may revise their entry as the research progresses. As more re- sponses are received, they will be added to the Web version of this listing at the Fall 1998 343
344 Journal of Education for Library and Information Science Research Record Web site [http://www. personal.kent.edu/-mkim/resrecord] and will also be listed in a future col- umn. In some cases, entries in the elec- tronic version may have additional in- formation provided by the candidate. University of California, Los Angeles Benoit, Gerry.
