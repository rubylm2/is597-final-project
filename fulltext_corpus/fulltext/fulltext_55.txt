SUBJECT VARIETY IN ADULT READING: I. FACTORS RELATED TO VARIETY IN READING ELIZABETH WARNER MC ELROY The adult reader must, by the nature of our society and of our reading scene, be one to whom reading is an individual matter, directed by his personal interests, his personal needs, his time limitations, his purse, and his skills. . . . Obviously, even the best of readers, with time limited only by his life span, could not read all that is worth reading and available today. Reading must, therefore, be an individual affair, a matter of constant choice and rejection.' T HIS study is an attempt to de- scribe the subject preferences of a national sample of adult book readers as the readers themselves stated them and to relate those preferences to the reader's age, sex, education, em- ployment, sources of books, and past and present reading habits.2 Since reading preferences are the re- sult of such a large number of complex influences, the readers do not fall neatly into a few well-defined slots; and clear- cut cause and effect relationships do not emerge. But trends and tendencies can be shown that help to describe adult book readers and, to a limited extent, how they developed. The data for this study were provided by an amalgam survey made in 1965 by the National Opinion Research Center. The NORC amalgam surveys are peri- odic surveys that include items on sev- eral subjects. "The universe in the NORC amalgam studies is the total non-institutional population of the United States, 21 years of age or older. ... The sample is a standard multi-stage area probability sample to the block or segment level. At the block level, how- ever, quota sampling is used with quo- tas based on sex, age, race and employ- ment status."3 A preliminary report issued September, 1965, described some of the results of this survey and related them to earlier studies on reading.4 Of the 1,469 adults who were ques- tioned, 712 (48 per cent) were readers. They answered "Yes" to the question, "Have you read any book either hard cover or paper back, within the past six months? (If you've started, but not finished a book, that counts too.)" These 712 readers were then asked how many books they had read in the past six months and where they obtained their books. They were asked whether they had read each of ten categories (subjects) of books frequently, occa- sionally, hardly ever, or never. Both readers and non-readers were asked whether they had read a great deal at 1 Lou LaBrant, "Reading Interests and Tastes: An Individual Matter," in H.

Ennis for his help in the conception and development of this study and to the National Opinion Research Center for the use of their fa- cilities and the data on which this study is based. 3National Opinion Research Center Amalgam Survey, "Sample Design for NORC's Amalgam Surveys," (June, 1965), p. 1.

SUBJECT VARIETY IN ADULT READING 155 any time in the past, and they were asked about income, education, age, and employment. Each of the 712 readers said he had read no type of book frequently or from one to ten types frequently. This number of books read frequently was used as an index of the variety in that person's reading, and this index was related to the reader's other character- istics. "Persons who read do so for many different reasons, as different as types of their book reading are sum- marized in Table 1. These provide a subject measure of reading interest rather than of reading accomplishment because there is no way of knowing whether the respondents actually read books of the types they said they did. The thoughtfulness of their responses is indicated by the selectivity with which they answered. Only twenty-six people (4 per cent) said they read six or more types frequently. Although the men are different from one another."5 In this limited study of a group of readers we were not able to determine why they read, but we could determine what kinds of people read what kinds of books. From this we can infer some of the "many different reasons" why they chose the types of books they did. FACTORS RELATED TO VARIETY IN READING The answers of the 712 readers to questions about the frequency and first two categories, mysteries and fic- tion, are closely related (and indeed have the largest combined number of frequent readers), forty-five people said they read one frequently and never read the other. This type of selectivity was shown by nearly all the readers. The definitions of "frequently," 'occasionally," and "hardly ever" were also subjective ones. Since every reader put each subject into one of the four categories, he had to establish relative values, even if no absolute values were assignable. A reader's definition of fre- quency of reading a subject undoubted- ly depends on the amount of reading he does. If four out of five books he reads TABLE 1 FREQUENCY OF TYPES OF BOOK READING (N = 712)* (Per Cent) Type of Book Fre- Occa- Hardly Never Total qtiently sionally Ever Fiction-classic or current ............... 37 33 20 10 100 Mysteries, Westerns, science fiction, humor 21 32 24 23 100 Social science, business, politics .......... 15 26 26 33 100 Plays, poetry, art, music .13 25 24 38 100 Science or technology .10 20 24 46 100 Histories or biographies .26 41 16 17 100 Religious books (other than the Bible) 24 30 21 25 100 Books on health or family care. 16 36 21 27 100 Self-improvement books .15 33 20 32 100 Hobbies, sports, gardening, cookbooks, home repair, home decoration, travel. . . 31 36 13 20 100 * This table (in slightly different form) was first published in Ennis, op. cit.

If four out of the twenty read by someone else are fiction, that person would probably say he reads fiction occasionally or perhaps hardly ever. Even if "frequently" had been defined quantitatively, it is unlikely that the reader's memory would have been reli- able enough to provide a precise answer. Each reader did his own subject classification. Apparently the ten cate- gories were easily identifiable, and it TABLE 2 DISTRIBUTION OF READERS AMONG NUMBER OF TYPES OF BOOKS READ FREQUENTLY (Per Cent) No. of T pes Those Who No. of Types Readers Read of Books Read (N = 712) Frequently Frequently (N =582) None....... 18 ....... 1......... 27 31 2......... 21 25 3......... 16 20 4......... 10 12 5......... 5 7 6......... 2 3 7 or more .... 1 2 Total. 100 100 was possible for the reader to fit his reading interests into them. And we have the reader's own estimate of his reading, rather than an indirect esti- mate based on circulation statistics, book sales, or a classification system superimposed on the titles listed or se- lected by the respondent. The variety index created from the number of books the reader said he read frequently ranged from zero to ten. The distribution of readers in the variety levels is shown in Table 2. Eighteen of those who said they had read at least one book in the past six months read no subject frequently; 18 per cent read four or more. Another 25 per cent read one type frequently, and the remainder read two or three types. We find that the readers are distributed through the whole range and are not aggregated at any particular level. In relating the number of types of books read frequently to the other characteristics of the readers, no at- tempt was made to differentiate the sub- jects or to weight them in any way. There was no regard to the differences in form-novel, poetry, essay, and so forth-except as it was implicit in the question, nor was there any attempt to ascribe value judgments in terms of in- tellectual level. Obviously some of the categories are closely related to one an- other, but a reader who read only mys- teries and fiction was considered to have as much variety in his reading as one who read only science and poetry. Any attempt to classify the subjects-high- brow and lowbrow, for instance-was not successful. The variety index was used to deter- mine the relationship between variety and the other characteristics of the read- ers-amount of past and present read- ing, sources of books, number of types of books read frequently, education, in- come, age, and sex. The readers were divided into five groups-those who read one, two, three, four, or more types frequently and those who read nothing frequently. PRESENT READING PATTERNS The readers were asked three ques- tions about present reading habits: (1) "How many books have you read in the past six months?" (2) "Where did you get the book(s) you read?" (3) "Where do you obtain most of the books you read?" The answers to these questions
SUBJECT VARIETY IN ADULT READING 157 were related to the number of types of books read frequently. Table 3 shows that variety increases sharply with the number of books read. The largest percentage of readers in each column jumps into a higher row as the number of books read in the past six months increases. Half of those who read one book in six months read noth- ing frequently, but half of those who read eleven or more books in the past six months read three or more types fre- quently. The differences are most pro- nounced among those who read only one book in six months. This is to be expected, because it is possible to read many books on one subject but impos- sible to have many subjects spread over a few books. (Actually, a number of readers must have felt that it was pos- sible-105 people said they had read three or more subjects frequently but had read fewer than six books in six months.) Another significant characteristic of readers is the source of the books they read. Respondents were asked to name the one major source and all the impor- tant sources of the books they had read in the past six months. Tables 4 and 5 show the answers to these questions and their relation to variety in reading.

158 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY The patterns in both of these tables are irregular, but a few trends stand out. Libraries and stores are the major source of books for all readers. But the relative importance varies. Libraries are utilized more by those who read with the most variety. Loans from friends and relatives are less important for the person who reads many subjects than for the person who reads nothing frequently. When readers are asked to greater degree; and since variety and quantity of reading are closely asso- ciated, we can assume that he is acquir- ing a relatively greater number of books as well as a more diversified collection. We could speculate that he buys current books (including reprints of older ones) and uses the library for those he cannot purchase or may not wish to own. We see evidence of increasing independence of judgment as the reader's variety in- name all their major sources, these gen- eral trends are intensified, with a few exceptions. Table 5 shows that the number of sources which were named by the read- ers increased with the variety of read- ing. These increases are most pro- nounced in the sources which are also named as the single major sources- libraries and stores. Loans from friends and relatives are actually mentioned by fewer of those who read four or more subjects frequently than by those who read with less variety. The reader who reads many subjects acquires his books through many channels. He apparently tends to rely on his own judgment to a creases. Loans from friends or relatives and reliance on book clubs decreases, while use of libraries, stores, and the reader's own collection increases. The reader's collection, which was men- tioned as the major source by only 3 per cent of those who read four or more types of books and by 6-9 per cent of those who read fewer types, is named as one source by 28 per cent of those who read four or more types. It is interesting to note that the great- est reliance on book clubs is by those who read two or three subjects. This is evidence of an interest in reading that is reflected by a moderate variety and quantity but is not evidence of the inde- TABLE 5 VARIETY IN READING AND TOTAL NUMBER OF SOURCES OF BOOKS (Per Cent)* No. OF TYPES OF BooKs READ FREQUENTLY ALL SOURCCE READERS None 1 2 3 4 or More (N =712) (N=130) (N=182) (N=146) (N=117) (N=137) Stores . .29 36 43 57 51 43 Libraries ........................ 25 42 38 49 61 43 Loans from friends or relatives .. 42 28 44 37 34 36 Book clubs . .14 18 21 23 18 19 Own collection . .17 19 24 21 28 22 Gift. 11 10 12 15 18 13 Other . .9 7 8 12 7 8 Average no. of sources .......... 1.5 1.6 2.0 2.1 2.2 1.8 * Totals equal more than 100 per cent because respondents could name more than one source.

Since the question concerned sources of books the respondent had read recently, it can be assumed that he reads the books he is given. These books may come from professional or business colleagues or from members of the reader's family who are conversant with his interests. These books of course be- come part of his own collection and also increase that source of reading mate- rial. There are an almost infinite number of factors which influence reading in- terests-schooling, family, institutions, personality structure. Many are diffi- cult if not impossible to measure quan- titatively. But education is one which can be measured-in terms of years at least-and Table 6 shows that there was a consistent increase in the variety of reading as the amount of education increased. Thirty-two per cent of the college graduates read fewer than two subjects frequently; 68 per cent of those with no high school education Variety and quantity of reading go hand in hand. Those who read a number of subjects tend to read more books in a given period of time than those whose reading has less variety. Those who read with more variety use more sources to obtain their books and exercise more independence of judgment in making their choices. PAST INFLUENCES ON PRESENT READING The kinds of neighbors we have, the kinds of institutions to which we belong, the kinds of schools which we attend-all play their part in determining the interests we develop.6 read with this degree of variety. The differences between the three groups which have more than eight grades, but fewer than twelve, are small, but the tendency persists. Those with eighth- grade education or less stand out par- ticularly, but it must be remembered that the amount of education of these people varies from one to eight years- TABLE 6 EDUCATION AND VARIETY IN READING (Per Cent) EDUCATION No. OF TYPES OF 4 Years 1-3 Years READELRS BooKcs READ FREQUENTLY 4 Years 1-3 Years 4Yas 13ers 1-8 RDR College College High High Grds (N = 712) NCollege C g ( e = c8) Shool School =rades (N=124) (N=158) (N =22 1) (N =13 1) =8 None ................ 9 16 19 21 32 18 1 ................ 23 25 24 24 36 27 2 ................ 28 19 18 27 10 20 3 ................ 18 15 20 15 9 16 4 or more ............. 22 25 19 13 13 19 Total ............... 100 100 100 100 100 100 6 Jacob Getzels, "The Nature of Reading Inter- ests," in Helen M.

Table 7 shows how many people in each educational level in the whole sample have read at least one book in the past six months. We see that the proportion quadruples as education in- creases from eight grades or less to four years of college. It is obvious that edu- cation has much more effect on reading itself than on the variety in the content of that reading. Early reading habits bear a relation- ship to present ones in several respects and specifically to diversity in subject TABLE 7 DISTRIBUTION OF READERS AMONG EDUCATIONAL LEVELS Education Readers N (Per Cent) 4 years college ........... 89 150 1-3 years college ......... 72 220 4 years high school ....... 54 409 1-3 years high school . .. .......40 323 1-8 grades ............... 21 366 Total N .............1 ...... 1,468 matter. Thirty per cent of the readers said they had never read heavily, but they had read at least one book in the preceding six months. The remaining 70 per cent had read heavily at some time in the past, and one-third of them have always read heavily. When the readers were asked when they read intensively, 26 per cent said they had always read heavily, and the others named one or more periods of heavy reading (Table 8). We can separate the readers into four groups: ( 1) the consistent readers (those who have always read heavily and those who read heavily after school and during at least one school period), (2) the during-school readers, (3) the after-school readers (those who did not read heavily until after their schooling, and (4) the light readers (those who said they had never read heavily but had read a book recently). Table 9 shows the distribution of these four types of readers. When we examine the reading variety of these four groups of readers (Table 10), we see that the consistent readers TABLE 8 PERIODS OF HEAVY READING IN THE PAST (N = 712) (Per Cent)* Always, Since Before During During After Childhood High School High School College School Other Never 25 9 17 4 23 7 30 * Since more than one period could be mentioned by those who had read heavily at some time, percentages total more than 100.

SUBJECT VARIETY IN ADULT READING 161 tend to have the most variety. Those who read during or after school follow in that order. The light readers (those who never read heavily) have the least variety. The consistent reader is more likely to read a range of subjects than the spasmodic reader. A period of heavy reading during school increases the like- lihood of variety more than a period of heavy reading which occurs after schooling. The reverse of this is also true-the light reader is four times as likely as the consistent reader to read AGE, INCOME, SEX, AND EMPLOYMENT STATUS Age, sex, family income, and employ- ment status are all characteristics re- lated to reading. The controlling factor is likely to be education, and we have seen that education itself does bear a relationship to reading variety. The dis- tribution of the variety index for sev- eral age groups, income groups, and em- ployment status were tabulated. There was little divergence from the distribu- tion of the whole sample for sex and nothing frequently. However the person who read heavily during or after school is three times as likely as the consistent reader to read nothing frequently. Di- viding these four groups by educational level would give further clues to the relationship between education, early reading habits, and present variety, but the cells are too small. Variety in reading is positively related to education, and reading itself is even more closely related. Early and con- sistent involvement in reading is likely to increase the subject breadth of adult reading. One period increases the like- lihood of subject variety, but not to the same degree. age. Income and, to a greater extent, employment did show some relationship to reading variety. We see in Table 11 that there is a slight tendency for the oldest people (sixty-five and older) to read with more variety than younger people. This trend is not strong, but 45 per cent of the read- ers over sixty-five read three or more types frequently; only 30-40 per cent of those under sixty-five read with this much variety. We find a better picture of the effect of age if we compare readers to non- readers. As Table 12 shows, the propor- tion of readers in each age group de- creases steadily and markedly with age TABLE 10 PAST READING HABITS AND PRESENT DIVERSITY (Per Cent) READERS No. OFTYPESOF ALL BOOKs READ Con- During After Light READERS FREQUENTLY sistent School School Readers Other (N = 712) (N = 187) (N = 137) (N=139) (N =214) (N35) None ........... 7 20 22 26 ......... 18 1 ........... 19 18 29 32 ......... 27 2 ........... 21 22 19 20 ......... 20 3 ........... 23 20 11 12 ......... 16 4 or more ........ 30 20 19 10 ......... 19 Total .......... 100 100 100 100 ......... 100
162 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY -from 60 per cent of those under thirty-five to 25 per cent of those in the sixty-four to seventy-four-year-old group. There is a slight increase for those over seventy-five, but it must be remembered that the number of persons in this group is small, and a few per- centage points may not be significant. So we see that relatively few older people read, but those who do read with more variety than younger people. When the incomes of readers and non-readers are compared (Table 13), we see that the proportion of readers in- creases as income increases. One-third of those in the lowest income group are readers, but the proportion doubles in the $8,000-$15,000 group and is still larger for those whose family income is over $15,000. Undoubtedly this in- crease in the proportion of readers as income increases is related to educa- tion. To further demonstrate the rela- tionship between these three character- istics, education was held constant, and the proportion of readers in three in- come levels who read two or more types of books was determined (Table 14). The general trend is one of slight in- crease in the number of people reading with this degree of variety as the amount of education increases. The high school graduates with incomes un- der $5,000 are an exception to this trend. No explanation can be offered for this, but it should be noted that the cell is small.

Forty-five per cent of the readers are male, and this proportion of males and females persists through all of the vari- ety levels, with only a few percentage points variation and no observable trend. However the employment status of women does seem to be related to their reading variety, as we shall see when we compare working women to housewives. Occupational status varies so widely in a broad sample that no meaningful correlations are possible. Income and education are much more meaningful measures of achievement, and we have seen how they are related to variety in reading and to reading itself. However, it is possible and useful to contrast the reading variety of full-time and part- time workers, housewives, and those who have retired. Table 15 shows this distribution, and we find that part-time workers tend to read with more variety than full-time workers and with con- siderably more variety than housewives. When we contrast readers and non- readers (Table 16), we see that 47 per cent of the housewives are readers but that 53 per cent of the part-time work- TABLE 14 EDUCATION, INCOME, AND VARIETY IN READING: PERCENTAGE READING Two OR MORE TYPES OF BOOKS FREQUENTLY* EDUCATION ANNUAL FAMILY Less Than Four Four Years INCOME Years High School High School College Per Cent N Per Cent N Per Cent N $0}$4J999 ......... 43 (107) 68 (41) 56 (45) $5,000-$7,999 ..... 50 (68) 51 (87) 63 (92) $8,000 and over.... 47 (34) 60 (90) 65 (65) * Fifty-five per cent of all readers read two or more types of books frequently.

164 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY ers read at least one book in six months. Only one-third of the retired persons are readers-not surprising in view of what we have seen in Table 12. Retired people who do read tend to read with less variety than those who are still working. As we have seen, there is a slight tendency in the other direction for all people over sixty-five. Apparent- ly those people over sixty-five who are still working read with significantly greater variety than those who have re- tired. If we compare women who work full time with those who work part time and with full-time housewives, we find that these differences are even more pro- nounced (Table 17). Men who work TABLE 16 READING AND EMPLOYMENT Employment Status Readers N (Per Cent) Full time .52 691 Part time .53 143 Housewives .47 410 Retired .32 152 Unemployed, student, other .53 73 Total N ............. ...... 1 ,469 full time are included in the table to show the comparison between them and the various categories of women. There are not enough men in the sample who work part time to provide a meaningful comparison. The levels of reading variety of the men and women who are employed full time are similar, but there are consider- able differences in the variety of the reading of the three groups of women- part-time workers have the most vari- ety and housewives the least. We might suspect that education is an important contributory factor, and we find that it is for some of the readers. When we tabulate the reading variety of the three groups of women (Table 18), we find that those with some college read with more variety than those with no educa- tion beyond high school. This is to be expected on the basis of our findings for the readers as a whole. The striking fact is that education makes so little differ- ence for the housewives. Only a few of the college-educated housewives read with more variety than the housewives who had less education. For the women who work full time, the difference is re- markable-three-fourths of the college- TABLE 17 VARIETY IN READING OF WOMEN BY EMPLOYMENT STATUS (Per Cent) WOMEN No. OF TYPES OF MEN BooKcs READ WoRE FULL BOOKSUENTLY Keep House Work Part Work Full TIME FREQUEN7TLY Full Time Time Time (N=246) (N = 191) (N = 5 7) (N = 112) None ............ 24 9 17 18 1 ............ 26 31 25 26 2 ............ 18 7 22 22 3 ............ 16 23 15 17 4 or more......... 16 30 21 17 Total .......... 100 100 100 100

Education seems to make no difference-all part-time workers read with more variety than housewives. These results lead us to wonder whether the same patterns are true for the amount of reading. We have seen that reading variety and quantity of reading are closely related, and Table 19 shows how quantity of reading is re- lated to employment status when edu- cation is held constant. For housewives the pattern is the same-college-edu- cated women tend to read very little more than those with less education. Part-time workers and full-time work- ers have similar patterns of reading quantity-in both cases college educa- tion is likely to mean considerably more book reading. While we found that edu- cation did not seem to affect the reading variety of the part-time worker, it defi- nitely affects the reading quantity. And the part-time worker with high school education is no more likely to read a large number of books than is the housewife with comparable education. There are a number of possible ex- planations which might be offered for these findings. Education does not seem to have much effect on the number of books a housewife reads or on the vari- ety of subjects. It must be remembered that by housewife we mean full-time housewife; in this sample 80 per cent of the working women with high school education and 66 per cent of the work- TABLE 18 EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT STATUS, AND VARIETY IN READING OF WOMEN: PERCENTAGE READING TWO OR MORE TYPES OF BOOKS FREQUENTLY EMPLOYMENT STATUS EDUCATION Keep House Work Part Time Work Full Time Per Cent N Per Cent N Per Cent N High school or less ....... 48 (144) 59 (34) 46 (59) College .................. 53 (47) 61 (23) 74 (53) TABLE 19 EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT STATUS, AND QUANTITY OF READING OF WOMEN: PERCENTAGE READING SIX OR MORE BOOKS IN SIX MONTHS* EMPLOYMENT STATUS EDUCATION Keep House Work Part Time Work Full Time Per Cent N Per Cent N Per Cent N High school or less ..... . 40 (144) 38 (34) 32 (59) College ................. 45 (47) 56 (23) 62 (53) * Forty-five per cent of all readers read six or more books in six months.
166 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY ing women with college education are presently married. Education does make a considerable difference in both the quantity and variety in the reading of full-time workers. Although the read- ing variety of part-time workers does not increase with education, the amount of reading does. The high-school-edu- cated part-time worker reads with more variety than the housewife with the same education, but she reads no more books in a given period of time. Apparently, increased education does not stimulate the housewife to read more books or more subjects than the woman with less education. The house- wife may be too busy to read, or the concerns of running a household may have superseded the interests which she acqiuired in school. Or perhaps she never expanded her interests beyond those she had in high school. In her case college had little effect on her reading habits-to the extent that they are re- flected in the answers to these ques- tions. Those who work present quite a different picture. Both variety and quantity of reading are considerably greater for college-educated women than for those with less education. Probably the same factors influence these women to read as influence them to work-energy, both physical and in- tellectual, and a desire for activity out- side their homes. Their reading may re- flect a desire for job-related knowledge or information on the world around them, or perhaps it reflects a wider range of recreational reading, or all of these. The part-time worker apparently has both the time and the inclination to read more subjects, but not more books, than the housewife with comparable education. Since the part-time worker is probably working because she wants to rather than because she must support herself or her family, her working is likely to be a manifestation of the same interests that induce her to read. Still another factor in the relatively limited reading of the housewives may be the loneliness of housekeeping-in terms of opportunity for discussion of books. Reading itself may be a solitary activ- ity, but in general it requires conversa- tion if interest is to be sustained. Jan Hajda discusses this in his study of readers and reading. Book reading in adult life is sustained not only by the existence of appropriate social ties with- in the proximate social structures, but also by the recurrence of interpersonal situations which minimize the individual's isolation from others. To persist over the years, the act of book read- ing must be incorporated-at least intermit- tently-into a social context. Reading a book becomes meaningful when after completion, it is shared with others or acted upon in the com- pany of others. Social integration which gen- erates engagement with others also sustains a persistent engagement with books. Social isola- tion, in contrast, is likely to lead to the aban- donment of books.7 This type of social isolation may be one cause for the limited reading of retired people. Education and physical difficul- ties in reading or in obtaining books are undoubtedly more important, but the lack of stimulation of conversation with working colleagues and friends may be a contributing factor. SUMMARY In many of the characteristics of readers we have considered we cannot be sure what is cause and what is effect. The persons who read many subjects read many books, and this in turn leads to greater intensity.

SUBJECT VARIETY IN ADULT READING 167 woman reads and works for many of the same reasons, and her education stimulates both activities. The reader who reads heavily at some time is likely to read heavily again. As a reader be- comes more involved in reading, he is likely to use more sources for books and to exercise more independence of choice; exposure may stimulate further interest. If he continues to read until he is sixty-five, he will read with a little more variety than younger people. In any event, early involvement in reading is likely to lead to later variety and quantity of reading. On the average this has a greater effect than later in- fluences. The more books a reader reads in a given period of time, the more likely he is to read a number of different sub- jects. Heavy reading that begins early and continues through the reader's life is more likely to be associated with variety than light or spasmodically heavy reading. The more education he has had, the more likely he is to read a number of different subjects. Education seems to make little difference in the reading variety of housewives, but it significantly increases the reading vari- ety of working women. Part-time work- ers read with more variety than those who work full time. Variety in reading increases slightly with income, even when education is held constant. The proportion of people who read at all decreases sharply with age and increases with income. Sex dif- ferences are not significant. Libraries surpass bookstores as the more important source only for those who read many types of books; the more types of books a person reads, the more sources he is likely to use. Lester Asheim summed up a discussion of these factors as follows: "We know that the readers are the ones with the most edu- cation. Education is the major correlate of reading, no matter how you approach it. It is clear that in each of the other groupings mentioned above-age, occu- pation, and economic status-education is a hidden factor. And within each group the difference between those who read much and those who read little is education."8 We could add to this that the differ- ence between those who read many subjects and those who read few sub- jects is also education.
