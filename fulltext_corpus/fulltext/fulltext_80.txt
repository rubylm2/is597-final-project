Library School Faculty Doctorates: A Statistical Review RAYMOND KILPELA This study was undertaken to determine whether or not there was an over-all discernible trend either downward or upward in the percentage of earned doctorates held by the faculties of the accredited library school programs during the period from 1960 to 1978. The over-all percentage of faculty members with doctorates increased from 32. 1 percent in 1960 to 65.9 percent in 1978. The largest over-all gain was made at the assistant professor level. Although women have made a more spectacular gain in the percentage of doctorates held than men, men throughout the period have held a larger percentage of doctorates than women. Women in 1960 filled a majority of the positions in the accredited schools. Men constituted a majority in the 1978-79 academic year. The Ph.D., first with a major in library science and then followed by majors in other disciplines - most frequently the humanities or education - is the most common type of doctoral degree held by library school teachers. Eight schools - located in the Great Lakes region and the east - are primarily responsible for granting the library science doctorate to library school faculties. IN THE 18 YEAR PERIOD from 1960 to 1978, the number of accredited library school programs has almost doubled. In the fall of 1960, there were 32 schools offering master's programs accredited by the American Library Association. By the fall of 1978, the number had increased to 63. This period also saw a tremendous increase in library school enrollments as a result of which came a large increase in the size of the library school faculties.

JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP With growth of such magnitude, the question arises if the educational quality of the faculties among the accredited programs was maintained. In most graduate programs, the doctorate is considered as a prerequisite for teaching. A number of earlier studies have been made in which the possession of a doctorate, academic rank, and sex of the accredited library school facul- ties have been among the characteristics selected for analysis. In 1962, Leontine D. Carroll made a study of both the full and part-time faculties of the accredited library school programs. Of the full time teachers who responded to her questionnaire, 46.5 percent were men; 52.9 percent were women; and 0.6 percent failed to indicate sex. Doctorates were held by 41.4 percent of the full-time teachers. An analysis was not made of the sex of the respondents holding doctorates. No information was given regarding the respondents' academic rank.1 In 1974, J. Periam Danton conducted a survey of the faculties of British and (accredited) American library school teaching staffs regarding selected characteristics. In the case of the American schools, the results were based on a return of about 48 percent. Of the American respon- dents, 63.7 percent were men and 36.6 percent women; 15.6 percent of the Americans held a subject Ph.D. and 43.3 percent a library science doctorate, or a total of 59 percent held either a subject or a library science doctorate. Danton did not analyze the academic rank nor the sex of the respondents who held doctorates.2 Prior to the July, 1974, Preconference on the Status of Women in Librarianship sponsored by A.L.A. Social Responsibilities Round Table Task Force on the Status of Women, Elizabeth Futas collected statistics from 27 of the 58 library schools. Based upon these data, she reported at a general session of the preconference that "about three of these schools have over 50 percent women on their teaching staffs." She further stated that "... even in these cases, a large number of women are lecturers or part-time faculty." Beyond this, she furnished no details regarding the findings of her survey as to the percentage of women within each academic rank nor the percentage of doctorates held by women com- pared to men.3 Russell E. Bidlack has been conducting an annual review of library school salaries since 1973. Over the years, he has gradually expanded the amount of statistical data included in his survey. His first survey was based entirely on academic rank. In the 1974-76 survey, he included sex for the first time. He found that 58.2 percent of the faculties of 62 of a total of 65 accredited programs encompassed by his survey were men, and 41.5 percent were women.4 240
Library School Faculty Doctorates: A Statistical Review In the 1976-77 survey, Bidlack analyzed not only sex but also the number of doctorates held. He found that the faculties of the 64 library schools holding accreditation on January 1, 1977, were made up of 59 percent men and 4 1 percent women. Of the men, 69 percent held doctor- ates and 5 1 percent of the women. Calculating from the data in his survey, the over-all percentage of faculties holding doctorates was 61.8 percent.5 In his 1977-78 survey, Bidlack reported that 59.2 percent of the facul- ties in the 62 of the 64 accredited programs responding to his question- naire were men, and 40.8 percent were women. Based upon calculations made from the data set forth in the report, 73.6 percent of the men held doctorates compared to 53 percent for women. The over-all percentage for both sexes was 65.2 percent.6 Bidlack's 1978-79 survey was based on returns from 67 programs accredited as of January 1, 1979. Males held 58.6 percent of the faculty positions as compared to females' 4 1 .4 percent. Sixty-seven percent of the faculty members held doctorates. With Bidlack's data as the basis for calculation, 75.4 percent of the men held doctorates as contrasted with 55.2 percent of the women.7 The major purposes of the present study were to determine: 1. Whether or not during the period of unprecedented growth in the number of accredited library school programs and in the size of the faculties during the 1 8-year period from 1 960 to 1 978 there was a discern- ible trend either upward or downward in the precentage and types of doctorates held by the faculties of the schools collectively as a group. 2. Whether or not there was a significant difference in the percentage of doctorates held based upon academic rank and sex. None of the earlier studies had attempted to accomplish either of these purposes. The primary source used to obtain the names of the full-time faculty members of the library schools was the directory issue of the Journal of Education for Librarianship, which has been published annually beginning with the 1960-61 academic year. The directory is based upon materials submitted by the schools in the early fall of each academic year. Each issue with the exception of the 1967-68, 1968-69, and 1969-70 academic years specified whether or not a faculty member was full or part time. However, at times listed among the full faculty were visting, acting, and adjunct faculty members and even full-time personnel of another administrative unit of the university or college such as the library or another institution such as the local public library. Inasmuch as the study was limited to regular full-time faculty members holding an academic rank of professor, associate professor, assistant professor, instructor, and lecturer, every 241
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP effort was made to eliminate the names of teachers who were not mem- bers of the regular full-time faculty, and whose principal professional responsibility lay outside of the library school. In order to determine a person's principal area of professional respon- sibility, names were searched in biographical, library associations' mem- bership, and library directories such as Who's Who in Library Science, Who's Who in America, American Library Association's Membership List, and American Library Directory. Biographical sketches located through Library Literature and library schools' catalogs and annual reports were also used for this purpose. To ascertain whether or not a faculty member held an earned doctorate and the year in which and the university where it was conferred, all names were searched in Charles H. Davis' Doctoral Dissertations in Library Science, Titles Accepted by Accredited Library Schools, 1930-1975; Gail A. Schlachter's and Dennis Thomison's Library Science Dissertations, 1925-1972, an Anno- tated Bibliography; index volumes of Dissertation Abstracts; Library Literature; The National Union Catalog; and the listings of dissertations found in Library Quarterly. No one of these publications singly or collectively pro- vides complete coverage of all dissertations in library science or another discipline. Information regarding doctorates earned by faculty members was often gleaned from the biographical sources listed above. A written request was made to every accredited library school program for a copy of the listing of its current faculty and its catalog in order to determine with as much accuracy as possible whether or not a faculty member held a doctorate. Most schools responded. Microfiche copies of catalogs were searched for schools failing to supply the requested mate- rials. Older catalogs and annual reports, whenever they were available, were also searched for this type of information. Letters for further infor- mation were written to faculty members for whom doctorates were listed in their schools' catalogs, but for whom no entry was located in one of the above sources verifying the degree. Data were collected for each time faculty member for the 18-year period from 1960 to 1978. Since the primary purposes of this study were to determine whether or not there was an over-all discernible trend either downward or upward in the percentage of earned doctorates held collec- tively as a group and also by academic rank and sex of the faculties, a detailed analysis of the data was made at six-year intervals. In doing so, the over-all trends were detected without the inclusion of a huge mass of additional details in this report. The years chosen and the number of accredited programs included based on the directory issue for the corres- ponding year in the report are as follows: 1960-61, 32 schools; 1966-67, 38 schools; 1972-73, 57 schools; and 1978-79, 63 schools. 242
Library School Faculty Doctorates: A Statistical Review Findings of the study are show in Table 1 . Because of the small percen- tage of faculty members who held the ranks of instructors and lecturers, no textual analysis has been made of the data for these two ranks which are found in Table 1 . Any further analysis of these data would have little if any, significance for this report. As is obvious in the summary at the end of Table 1, the over-all percentage of faculty members with an earned doctorate increased steadily from 32.1 percent in 1960 to 65.9 percent in 1978 - more than doubling within a period of 18 years. The over-all percentage of faculty with a doctorate in the ranks of professor, associate professor, and assistant professor, including dean, showed a progressive increase for each year included in the survey with the exception of 1966 when a slight drop occurred in the over-all percentage at the professor level. A comparison of the statistics rank by rank reveals that there was a correlation between the percentage of earned doctorates and academic rank for each year analyzed in this report with one exception (in the case of deans for 1960). A greater percentage of doctorates was found in each ascending rank. Thus, the over-all percentage of deans with doctorates was higher than that of professors with doctorates for each year except 1960. Similarly, the over-all percentage of professors with doctorates was higher than that of associate professors, and a higher percentage of associate professors held doctorates than assistant professors for each of the four years included in this report. From an analysis of Table 1 , it would appear that a doctorate had almost become one of the prerequisites for advancement in academic rank during the period covered by this study. The largest over-all increase in the percentage of doctorates held was made at the assistant professor level. The percentage has increased from 13.9 percent in 1960 to 62.1 percent in 1978 - an increase of four and half fold. The over-all percentage of doctorates at the associate professor level had more than doubled in the same period. In 1960, 32.1 percent of the faculty members with the rank of associate professor held doctorates. By 1978, the percentage had reached 69.4 percent of the total. The increase in the percentage of women holding doctorates has been more spectacular than that of men. However, at the same time there has been a steady over-all increase in the number of men and conversely a decline in the number of women on the faculties. In 1960, a majority - 55.4 percent - of the faculty positions were filled by women of whom 19.4 percent held doctorates. Men held 44.6 percent of the positions. Of the male faculty members, 48 percent had earned their doctorates. In actual numbers, there were 18 women and 36 men with doctorates as 243

Library School Faculty Doctorates: A Statistical Review compared to 75 women and 39 men without. Men with doctorates out- numbered women by two to one, but on the other hand women without doctorates almost outnumbered men by two to one. In 1966, the division was almost even between women and men, 19.9 percent of the women held doctorates and 46.3 percent of the men. Even though there was a slight increase in the percentage of women with doctorates and a slight decline in the percentage of men with doctorates, 76 of a total of 164 men as compared to 32 of a total of 161 women had completed their doctorates. Men with doctorates continued to outnumber women at more than two to one. In 1972, men held a majority (57.3%) of the positions and women 42.7 percent; 56.4 percent of the men had earned their doctorates and 33 percent of the women. By 1978, the over-all percentage of faculty posi- tions staffed by men reached 59.1 percent, surpassing the 1960 percen- tage of 55.4 percent held by women. Women filled the remaining 40.9 percent of the library schools' positions. Three hundred male faculty members of a total of 407 among the 63 accredited schools had earned their doctorates or 73.7 percent of them as compared to 1 54 females from a total of 282 or 54.6 percent of them. Male faculty members with doctor- ates outnumbered their female counterparts by a ratio of almost two to one. One of the most significant increases in the percentage of doctorates held by women has been made at the deanship level. In 1960, ten (33.3%) of the schools were headed by females and 20 schools (66.7%) by males, a ratio of one female dean to every three male deans. There were two vacant deanships. Two (20%) of the female and eleven (55%) of the male deans had completed their doctorates. In 1978, the number of accredited pro- grams had risen to 63. Thirteen (22%) of the schools were headed by females, and 46 (78%) by males. Four deanships were vacant. The percen- tage of female deans with doctorates reached 92.3 percent, slightly sur- passing the male deans' percentage of 91.3 percent. From 1960 to 1978, the percentage of female deans having earned doctorates increased more than four and half fold while the percentage of males had doubled. Similarly, the percentage of females staffing the two senior ranks - professor and associate professor - has shown a steady drop during the years included in this survey and the percentage of men in these ranks has constantly increased while at the same time there has been almost a constant increase in the percentage of women and men in these two ranks with doctorates. During none of the years included in the survey did women hold a majority of the professorships. From 1960 to 1978, the percentage of professorships filled by women declined from 43.3 percent to 29.6 percent, and conversely the percentage staffed by men rose from 245
Library School Faculty Doctorates: A Statistical Review 56.7 percent to 70.4 percent. At the same time, the percentage of doctor- ates held by women on the professor level rose from 38.5 percent in 1960 to 63.8 percent in 1978, and by men from 70.6 percent in 1960 to 80.4 percent in 1978. In 1978, there were 90 of a total of 1 12 male professors and 30 of a total of 47 female professors who had earned doctorates. For every female professor with a doctorate, there were three males. At the associate professor level in 1960, a substantial majority (71.4 %) were held by women and a minority (28.6%) by men. Of the women, 22.5 percent had earned doctorates and 56.3 percent of the men. In 1972, men held a slim majority (52.3%) of the positions and women (47.7%). Sixty- seven percent of the men had completed the doctorate and 36.1 percent of the women. By 1978, 58.7 percent of the positions at the associate professor level was filled by men and 41.3 percent by women. Nearly 72 percent of the men had doctorates and 66 percent of the women. The percentage of female associate professors with doctorates had almost tripled since 1960. In the ranks of professor and associate professor, men with doctorates were apparently replacing women without doctorates. The most spectacular increase in the percentage of doctorates held by both sexes has been made at the assistant professor level. Over-all, the percentage of doctorates held on this level has risen from 13.9 percent in 1960 to 62.1 percent in 1978 - an increase of more than four fold. However, the percentage of females with doctorates at this level has increased more dramatically than the percentage of males while concur- rently the percentage of females filling positions at this level has fallen off less sharply. In 1960, females staffed a majority (55.6%) and males a minority (44.4%) of the assistant professorships. Of the females, 5 percent had a doctorate and the males, 25 percent. In 1966, males formed a majority (51.4 percent) in the assistant professor positions, and females filled 48.6 percent of them. Thirty-one and half percent of the males had completed the doctorate as compared to 15.7 percent of the women. In 1972, 54.8 percent of these positions were staffed by men and 45.2 percent by women. More than 37 percent of the men held doctorates and 31 percent of the women. The gap between the two sexes in the percen- tage of doctorates earned appeared almost ready to close. In 1978, the total number of assistant professor positions dropped to 214 in 63 schools from 221 positions in 57 schools in 1972. However, females made a slight gain in the percentage of positions held although they did not regain a majority on this level. In 1978, females filled 48.6 percent of the assistant professorships and males 51.4 percent. The 1978 percentage of positions held by each sex was identical to the 1966 percen- tage. Both sexes made substantial progress in the percentage of doctor- ates held. Almost 52 per cent of the female assistant professors and 246
Library School Faculty Doctorates: A Statistical Review nearly 72 percent of the males had completed their doctorates. Since 1966, the percentage of females with doctorates had increased more than three times, and males had more than doubled. In spite of a substantial increase in the percentage of doctorates made by females at the assistant professor level, the gap in the percentages between the two sexes which had appeared to be ready to vanish in 1972 became larger in 1978. A difference of almost 20 percentage points existed between the sexes - the largest difference found at any rank. Table 2 provides data regarding the type of doctorate held. During each of the years included in the survey, more than 53 percent of the faculties held either a Ph.D. or a D.L.S. and approximately 30 percent a Ph.D. in a discipline other than library science. The Ed.D. is the least frequently held doctorate. rn.u. ru.u. Library Other Year Science D.L.S. Subtotal Fields Ed.D.

Type of Doctorate Table 3 indicates the library schools at which the faculties holding library science doctorates earned their degrees. The University of Chicago dominated the production of Ph.D. 's in library science from the inception of its program in 1932 to the early 1950's when the Universities of Illinois and Michigan in 1948 and Columbia University in 1952 estab- lished their doctoral programs. Later, they there followed by a host of other schools. By 1960, seven schools were awarding the library science doctorate, by 1972, 19, and by 1978, 29 of the 63 schools (46%) had a doctoral program. Based upon a review of the catalogs of the schools with doctoral pro- grams in September, 1978, all the schools with the exception of four offered only the one degree - the Ph.D. Columbia University maintained only the D.L.S. program. The University of California and the University of Southern California offered both the Ph.D. and D.L.S. programs. The option of the D.L.S. which was formerly offered by the University of Illinois is no longer listed in its current catalog. Simmons College pro- vided a doctoral program leading to the Doctor of Arts degree. In 1960, 19 of the 29 faculty members with a library science doctorate had earned their degrees at the University of Chicago. In 1 966, one school could no longer be identified as having been primarily responsible for 247

However, almost 84 percent of the teachers had received their degrees from one of four schools. The University of Chicago had been the sponsoring school for 20 or 32.6 percent of the faculty members with a library science doctorate. Fifteen (24.2%) were graduates of the University of Michigan's doctoral program, nine (14%) University of Illinois, and eight (12.9%) Columbia University. Between 1966 and 1972, there was almost a three fold increase in the number of faculty members with a doctorate in library science. Their number had increased from 62 in 1966 to 184 in 1972. Although 14 schools had been responsible for awarding these degrees, six of the 14 schools had granted 149 (81%) of these degrees. The schools with the number and percentage of degrees awarded by each were as follows: University of Michigan, 38 (20.7%); University of Chicago, 29 (15.8%); Columbia University, 24 (13%); University of Illinois, 24 (13%); Rutgers University, 20 (10.9%); and Case Western Reserve University, 14 (7.6%). By 1978, the number of faculty members with a library science doctor- ate had grown to 291, a ten fold increase since 1960, and the number of schools responsible for having granted these doctorates had grown from 248
Library School Faculty Doctorates: A Statistical Review five to 17; eight schools of which had sponsored 242 (83.5%) of the 291 doctorates. Five of the eight schools are located in the Great Lakes region and three in the east. The schools were: University of Michigan 42, (14.4%); Columbia University, 39 (13.4%); Case Western Reserve Univer- sity, 34 (11.7%); University of Pittsburgh, 33 (11.3%); University of Il- linois, 27 (9.3%); Rutgers University, 25 (8.6%); University of Chicago, 22 (7.6%), and Indiana University, 21 (7.2%). Table 4 shows data regarding the fields in which Ph.D.'s in disciplines other than library science were earned by the faculty members. The fields represented are the same as used by the National Research Council in compiling the 1979 survey of doctorate recipients from U.S. universities.

Major Fields for Ph.D. Degrees in Disciplines Other than Library Science Based upon the years included in this survey, there has been a steady decline n the percentage of Ph.D.'s in the humanities. The percentage has dropped from a high of 68.4 percent in 1960 to 33.8 percent in 1978, representing a 50 percent decline within the 18 year period. On the other hand, education has shown a steady increase from a low of 1 5.3 percent in 1960 to a high of 33.1 percent in 1978. By 1978, the number of teachers with a Ph.D. in education and the humanities was more or less equal. Sciences, engineering, and social sciences represented less than 3 1 per- cent of the Ph.D.'s during the 18-year period of this survey. Thus, from 1960 to 1978, the number of accredited library school programs rose from 32 to 63 almost doubling in number while the number of full time teachers increased from 168 to 689 or from an average of slightly more than five full-time teachers per school in 1960 to almost 11 teachers per school in 1978. With growth of such magnitude, the question arises whether or not the educational quality of faculties were maintained within this period of unprecedented growth. Admittedly, the educational quality of any faculty, including a library school faculty, is a rather elusive characteristic, difficult to judge, espe- cially in terms of doctoral degrees alone. Specified in the Standards for Accreditation as one of the bases for evaluating the faculty is evidence of "advanced degrees from a variety of academic institutions."8 A commonly 249
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP accepted practice in academe in the United States is to evaluate the educational quality of the faculty by the percentage of doctorates held. This practice has also become common in library education. As a part of their study of the "Impact of the Increase of Library Doctorates," Herbert S. White and Karen Momenee checked advertise- ments placed by library schools over a six-month period from June, 1976, to December, 1976, in selected higher education and professional library journals. They found that of the 17 positions advertised by A.L.A. accre- dited library schools with doctoral programs, 15 required a doctorate, four of which were willing to accept a subject doctorate in place of a library science doctorate. The other two advertisements showed a decided pre- ference for a library science doctorate without, however, absolutely de- manding one. White and Momenee further found that of the 19 positions advertised by the schools without doctoral programs, 1 8 made the doctor- ate a firm requirement even though 12 would accept the non-library science doctorate as an alternative. The one remaining school preferred, without requiring, a subject doctorate rather one in library science.9 In their study, White and Momenee concluded that "the importance of the earned doctorate for faculty in library schools in establishing and retaining status for the school within its own academic setting is recog- nized, cannot be ignored, and is probably behind much of the recent upgrading in educational requirements for faculty in library schools. In fact, schools that have recently undergone A.L.A. accreditation visits recognize the stress placed by the accreditation teams on both the number and diversity of earned doctorates as an indication of faculty compe- tence."10 In using the doctorate as the single criterion forjudging the educational quality of the faculties, there has been a significant improvement since 1960. In 1960, 32.1 percent held doctorates as contrasted by 65.9 percent holding doctorates in 1978, thereby, representing a percentage point gain of 33.8 or almost a doubling of the percentage points within a period of 1 8 years during which the number of teachers increased four fold. The question may be asked how do the library school faculties compare in their academic training with their counterparts in academe. The most recent statistics showing the percentage of doctoral degrees held by uni- versity faculties in the United States are for 1972-73 compiled by Alan E. Bayer based on a sample survey for the American Council on Education. With one significant difference, his data reveal that the library school faculties were more or less on an equal par with their fellow colleagues in terms of the doctorate. Based upon these statistics, 44.5 percent of the university faculty members held doctorates as compared to 46.6 percent of the library school teachers. Of the men, 59.3 percent of the university 250
Library School Faculty Doctorates: A Statistical Review faculty members held doctorates as against 57.3 percent of the male teachers in the library schools. The most significant difference was found in the percentage of women holding doctorates: 20.1 percent of the women university members held doctorates as contrasted to 33 percent of the female library school teachers.11 In spite of the fact that the percentage of women holding doctorates in the ranks of professor, associate professor and assistant professor among the faculties of the accredited library school programs has shown a greater increase than their male counterpars, the over-all percentage of women has shown a steady decline since 1960. Women in 1960 filled 55.4 percent of the faculty positions and of them, 19.4 percent held doctorates. By 1978, the percentage of women teachers had fallen to 40.9 percent and the percentage of women with doctorates had risen to 54.6 percent. Men by comparison in 1978 held 59.1 percent of the positions, and 73.7 percent of them had completed their doctorates. During the years included in this study, women were better represented on the library school faculties than they were in academe in general. In 1972, women held 42.7 percent of the library school faculty positions as contrasted with 22.7 percent of the faculty positions among the institu- tions of higher learning in the United States.12 For the purpose of com- parison with library schools, the percentage of women is somewhat over- stated since included are women in not only the universities but also the two and four year colleges. Based upon an estimate made by Saul D. Feldman on a "sample of 60,000 faculty, women constitute 13% of the American university faculty, (9% in high-quality universities), 25% of college faculty, and 26% of junior college faculty."13 The most recent, available statistics show that in 1976-77 the percentage of women among the faculties of academe stood at 24.7 percent. Bidlack in his survey of salaries for 1976-77 placed the percentage of female faculty members at 41.2 percent.15 In using the closest corresponding year found in this study, women in 1978 held 40.9 percent of the faculty positions in the accredited programs. Thus, in 1978 a difference of at least 16 points existed in the percentage of women found on the library school faculties and on the faculties of academe as a whole. For a teaching field like library science so heavily dominated by women in the past, an interesting explanation for the recruitment of men which began in the sixties has been given by Lillie S. Hornig, a member of the National Academy of Sciences' Commission on Human Resources and chair of its Committee on the Education and Employment of Women in Science and Engineering, and Executive Director of Higher Education Resource Services at Wellesley College, which conducts research on women in higher education. Hornig suggests that the "simple logic has . . . 251
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP to 'upgrade' traditionally female professions - nursing, librarianship, and elementary education - by recruiting more men into them." Her hypothesis is based upon the following premise: "It is statistically obvious that the quality of faculties must improve if the recruiting base of equally qualified personnel is broadened while total numbers of those selected must remain constant or decrease." She claims that there is some evidence that this reasoning has now been applied to male dominated teaching fields. Based upon her investigations, "women on science faculties in- creased about three times faster than total faculty growth between 1973 and 1977 and growth in the proportion of women at all ranks was fastest in research universities which traditionally had the fewest women."16 Hornig's explanation as applied to the increase in the percentage of male library school faculty members may be disputed on several points. Her explanation fails to take into account the fact that in the late sixties and up to the middle of the seventies there was a large increase in enrollment in the library school programs throughout the country. With this increase in enrollment came also an increase in the number of library school teachers. Therefore, the number of teaching positions in library science did not remain constant nor did the number decrease as suggested in Hornig's explanation. Schlachter and Thomison in their study of "The Library Science Doc- torate: a Quantitative Analysis of Dissertations and Recipients" for the period from 1925 to 1972 found that women received on average less than one-third of the library science doctorates in any given year.17 Using the statistical data provided in George H. Brown's study of Degree Awards to Women: an Update for the National Center for Education Statistics, women received an average of 42.2 percent of the library science docto- rates awarded between the years 1971-72 and 1975-76.18 Contrary to the implication contained in Hornig's explanation, the "recruiting base of equally qualified personnel" as judged in terms of the doctorate did not exist in library science. Males constituted a decided majority within the recruiting base. The supply of women with doctorates was not available from which women teachers could be selected. Libra- rianship has been dominated by women for a long time in this country. Based upon the 1970 census, 81.5 percent of the librarians were women and 19.5 percent men.19 In its 1980 survey of professional staffs in academic and public libraries, the A.L.A. Office of Library Personnel Resources found from an 86 percent return that women represented 72 percent of these staffs and men 28 percent.20 Leigh S. Estabrook and Kathleen M. Heim, using the annual placement and salary surveys in Library Journal between 1972 and 1980, calculated that the percentage of women receiving master's degrees from A.L.A. 252
Library School Faculty Doctorates: A Statistical Review accredited programs was 79 percent compared to men's 21 percent.21 Brown in his study of degree awards made to women for the National Center for Education Statistics reported almost the identical percentages. He found that women in 1971 were awarded 81.3 percent of the master's degrees in library science, and in 1977, they received 79.6 percent.22 The decline of female representation among the accredited program faculties for a professional field so heavily dominated by women poses a problem requiring the attention of the entire profession and the library school administrators along with their faculty selection committees. Women librarians are aware of the problem. At times, their frustrations have given way to remarks that may be exaggerated. In the March, 1980, issue of Working Woman included in Sue Hubbell's article entitled "Dis- quiet in the Stacks" was a statement attributed to Jenrose Femley, a member of the A.L.A. Committee on the Status of Women claiming that "men sit in the deans' chairs at all graduate library schools."23 As is obvious from the data included in this report, that statement is not true. Neverthe- less, heed must be taken of such remarks since expressed in them are the concerns of women librarians. One of the workshops at the July, 1974, Preconference on the Status of Women in Librarianship directed its attention towards women and library education. These discussions have resulted in changes being made in the A.L.A. Standards for Accreditation. Specifically cited at the workshop on education as one of "the ways in which library education had failed . . . women in the profession" was "the lack of feminist women on library school faculties," thereby, depriving "women of role models." It was further claimed that "the low percentage of women in high faculty rank within library schools contributes to their psychological scarring." Men- tioned also as "prominent examples of problems" were the lack of "access to doctoral programs" and lack of encouragement "to persue [sic, i.e. pursue] degrees beyond the master's level."24 Earlier at the second general session of the preconference, Sherrie Bergman in her discussion of career development noted that "there are few feminist role models in administration." She charged that "discrimi- nation prevents women from moving in administrative positions." She placed the responsibility for this situation squarely upon "Library school professors, mostly male, who act as sponsors for male students." As a result, she claimed that "male students generally received higher initial appointments than do women with corresponding achievements. The 'oldboy' system perpetuates the tendency for men in the higher level jobs."25 Thus, a feeling exists among many women of the need of a larger number of women faculty members to act as role models for other women 253
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP in the same manner that male faculty members have done for male students in the past. In their capacity as role models, women faculty members can encourage other women to seek and can sponsor them for positions of leadership in the profession and encourage them to pursue doctoral studies and assist them in obtaining financial aid for these studies. Directly as a result of discussions held at the preconference, a resolution was introduced by Futas on behalf of the workshop on education and subsequently adopted by both the participants in the preconference26 and the A.L.A. membership meeting at the 1974 Annual Conference resolv- ing that "the membership of the American Library Association directs the Committee on Accreditation to evaluate the positive implementation of affirmative action law as one of the criterion [sic] for accreditation or a re-accreditation of the library schools."27 In the course of the discussion of the preconference's workshop on education, it had been suggested that accreditation and re-accreditation might be used as a strategy. "The first target" would be the "schools where the faculty was heavily male, where the stress was on getting male doctoral students and where scholarship and fellowship aid went predominately to male candidates."28 Just prior to the announcement by the U.S. Supreme Court of its decision in the Bakke case, the A.L.A. Council at the 1978 Annual Con- ference passed a resolution encouraging "all A.L.A.-accredited library schools in the United States to continue affirmative action programs in admissions and employment."29 The substance of this resolution had been discussed earlier by the Task Force on Women at the 1978 Mid- winter Meeting.30 At the 1980 Annual Conference, the Committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship sponsored a preconference on "Women in a Woman's Profession - Strategies II," from which culminated a number of motions for consideration by the Council and A.L.A. membership. Among them was a proposed motion that "the A.L.A. Council direct the Committee on Accreditation to include affirmative action reports on faculty, staff, and students." The motion was passed by the membership. The Council, which approved it in principle, voted to refer the motion to C.O.A. for a report at the 1981 Midwinter Meeting.31 At the time, the Council asked C.O.A. "to revise its Standards by removing sexist language and adding affirmative action statements."32 The second printing of the Standards was published in April, 1981. A comparison of the second printing with the original printing reveals that the sexist langauge has been removed from the document and inserted within the last sentence of the last paragraph of the introductory sections just before "Section I. Program Goals and Objectives" a provision that "in 254
Library School Faculty Doctorates: A Statistical Review appointment, promotion, or pay of faculty and support staff "discimina- tion because of age, race, color, creed, religion, physical disability, or sex . . . shall be a violation of these Standards." In the original printing, the anti-discrimination provision applied only to "recruitment, admissions, or financial aid."33 Nowhere in the second printing of the Standards is made any specific mention of affirmative action. C.O.A. does not view itself as an enforcement agency for federal and state laws. C.O.A. believes that the responsibility for fulfillment of the Standards lies with the parent institu- tion of which the library school is a part.34 Whether or not the inclusion of an anti-discrimination provision in the Standards will result in a larger percentage of women faculty members remains to be seen. Success depends on a number of rather intangible factors. Foremost are the efforts made and the pressure applied on the part of the parent institutions and their affirmative action agencies and library school deans and their faculty selection committees to pursue similar goals. In re-accreditating library school prorams, C.O.A. can in its purview evaluate the extent to which library schools have been successful in fulfilling the anti-discrimination provision of the Standards and can make written recommendations for further implementation. It must, however, be pointed out that "While the Committee, as a part of its evaluation, examines each of the component factors, the final judgment is concerned with totality of the effort and the environment for learning in which it is carried on. The decision regarding accreditation is approached from an assessment of this totality, rather than from a consideration of isolated factors." The Standards further state that "the aim of the Standards for Accredita- tion is to provide guidance for the present which is sufficiently flexible to allow for future developments. The Standards are indicative but not pre- scriptive. As with the former Standards, the meaning and meaningfulness of the present Standards must lie in their application."35 Thus, in the final analysis, therefore, the anti-discrimination provision found in the Stan- dards is one but one of many factors tobe considered by C.O.A. A decision to accredit or re-accredit a library school program does not rest solely upon any one factor. The meaning given to the anti-discrmination provi- sion depends on future events and the interpretation given to it by C.O.A. at a given point in time. The effectiveness of this anti-discrimination is uncertain. In the interests of objectivity, it must be pointed that there is not unanimity as to the need for women to serve as role models in education. Hornig found that "there is only scattered evidence to suggest that pre- dominantly male faculties may not be able to provide an optimal educa- tion for the female half of the student body; this area needs further 255
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP investigation."36 There are feeble indications that women may be on their way toward re-establishing an equilibrium with men in their numbers among the library school faculties. Based upon this study, the number of male assistant professors, usually the entry level for most new faculty members, had declined from 121 in 1972 to 1 10 in 1978, and women had just slightly increased their numbers in this rank from 100 to 104. A similar trend is found in Bidlack's statistical survey for 1978-79. He reported that 60 new faculty members were hired of whom 29 were males and 31 females. Of these, 16 males and 15 females were appointed to assistant professorships.37 In his report on degree awards made to women, Brown singled out library science as the field which had the largest gain in doctorates awarded to women. From 1971 and 1977, the percentage of doctorates awarded to women had increased from 28.2 percent to 53.3 percent or a point gain of 25. 138 However, the statistics for 1978-79 as reported by the National Research Council in its survey of earned doctorates showed that this incease has not sustained itself. For this latest year, men received 56. 1 percent and women 43.9 percent of the doctorates in library science.39 In their analysis of 435 recipients of library science doctorates, com- pleted between 1953 and 1972, Schlachter and Thomison found that "although the majority of all doctorates go into teaching, proportionately more women are currently serving as faculty and more men are working as library administrators."40 Whether or not this past trend has and will continue in the future requires further research.41 Presently, women are seeking careers in professions and types of work which in the past have been largely closed to them, and they are turning away from fields in which they were found in greater numbers in the past. As a consequence, fewer women may decide to seek careers in librarianship, and women with library science doctorates in increasingly larger numbers may decide to seek administrative posi- tions in libraries rather than to enter teaching. Summary. The Ph.D. in library science, then followed by the Ph.D. in another discipline, is the most common type of doctorate held by library school faculty members. Trailing far behind the D. L.S., the Ed.D. is the degree least frequently held. A host of 17 library schools have been responsible for providing faculty holding an earned library doctorate with their education. Based upon the years included in this survey, eight schools - five located in the Great Lakes region and three in the east - have been responsible for granting the library science doctorate to more than 80 percent of library school teachers. Of these eight schools, Colum- bia University has awarded almost all the D. L. S. degrees. Other than 256
Library School Faculty Doctorates: A Statistical Review library science, the fields found most frequently pursued as majors for the Ph.D. were the humanities and education. The least frequently found fields were science, engineering, and social sciences. In spite of the noteworthy progress that has been made since 1960 in raising the over-all educational level of the library school faculties as judged in terms of the percentage of earned doctorates held, there still exists a need for a more equitable balance in the representation of men and women and a need to raise the over-all educational quality of women teachers as judged in the percentage of doctorates held to approximate that of men more closely. The gap in the representation of men and women and in the percentage of terminal degrees held by the two sexes is too wide. Men in 1978 maintained an edge of 18 points in the percentage of faculty positions and an edge of 19 points in the percentage of docto- rates held by them over women. Men in 1978 held 65.8 percent of the library school deanships and professor and associate professorships. As a rule, these positions are generally tenured in most institutions of higher learning. Faculty mem- bers in these ranks usually serve as role models encouraging students to pursue doctoral studies, assisting them in obtaining financial aid for their studies, and sponsoring for them for teaching as well as administrative positions in libraries. The crust of the problem appears to lie in the need to recruit more women with an interest in teaching into the doctoral programs. Women constitute more than 70 percent of the student bodies of the library schools and the profession as a whole. With this vast reservoir of human resources, library schools should be able to recruit a sufficient number of academically qualified women interested in teaching into their doctoral programs. Additional women teachers serving as role models can encour- age yet other women to pursue doctoral studies and to sponsor them for teaching positions. As is obvious from an analysis of Table 4, there has been a significant increase from 1960 to 1978 in the number of library school faculty members with Ph.D.'s in the social sciences, sciences, and engineering. In spite of this increase, the total number remains rather miniscule when viewed from the universe of the accredited library school programs. In 1978, there was an average of less than one teacher with a doctorate in these three fields combined per school. Admittedly, there were other faculty members who held master's degrees in these fields. However, it is well known that the profession since its inception in this country has been more closely tied to the humanities than to the social sciences, sciences, and engineering. There yet remains a need to obtain greater representa- tion of teachers with doctorates in these fields. 257
