Diversity in LIS Education Resources Compiled by Rong Tang School of Library and Information Science, Simmons College, rong.tang@simmons.edu Denice Adkins School of Information Science & Learning Technologies, University of Missouri, adkinsde@missouri. edu Contributors Janet Ceja School of Library and Information Science, Simmons College, janet.ceja@simmons.edu Nicole Cooke School of Information Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, nacooke@illinois.edu Robin Fogle Kurz School of Library and Information Management, Emporia State University, rkurz@emporia.edu Cecilia Salvatore School of Information Studies, Dominican University, csalvatore@dom.edu Laura Saunders School of Library and Information Science, Simmons College laura.saunders@simmons.edu In light of events in several countries that were instigated by values that are contrary to those held by the Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE), the ALISE Board of Directors reaffirms its commitment to, and promotion of, diversity, equality and inclusion in the library and information science (LIS) education and profes- sional community, and condemns racism, hate, bigotry, and violence. Diversity and inclusion are core elements of the LIS curriculum. To help LIS instruc- tors teach and promote diversity, equality, and inclusion in their curriculum, we have compiled a list of recent works. This list is intended to serve as a living document. We encourage LIS educators, professionals, and students to use these resources in relevant learning settings to further promote these values within the communities we serve.
