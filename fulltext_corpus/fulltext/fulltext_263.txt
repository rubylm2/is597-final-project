NEGRO LIBRARY WORKERS WALLACE VAN JACKSON TAST September marked the beginning of Hampton Institute Library School's fourteenth year of service to Negro .A...librarians and to librarianship. During these years many changes have been made in library service in the United States. City and county library facilities have been increased throughout the country, especially in the South. A study of library service would probably show that one of the greater advances has been in extending the service of books to Negroes and to residents of rural areas. Although a Negro was graduated from a library school as long ago as i0oo and since the early years of the twentieth century a few Negroes have been employed in libraries in the United States, the race had few workers in the field until the second decade of this century. By 1937, Negroes had entered library work in such large numbers that the Columbia Civic Library Association, a group of Negro librarians in Washington, D.C., decided to publish a directory of Negro graduates of accredited library schools.' As a result of the increasing importance of the Negro librarian and the extension of library service to Negroes in public and educational libraries, the author felt that a study of the Negro library workers was justified. Accordingly, he sent question- naires to 4oo Negroes employed in library service in capacities other than janitorial. The material collected relates only to paid workers in school and public libraries and is not concerned with NYA or other student help. The names of the persons to whom questionnaires were sent were taken from the dccredited secondary schools in the United I Columbia Civic Library Association, Directory of Negro graduates of accredited library schools, I9oo-t936 (Washington, D.C.: Columbia Civic Library Association, 1937). 95
96 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY States,2 from Public secondary schools for Negroes in the southern states of the United States,3 from The educational directory,4 from Report of the Library Institute for Negro Librarians,5 from lists of graduates and former students furnished by all the library schools in the United States and Canada which had admitted Negroes, and from correspondence with all city systems of the country which were thought likely to employ Negroes. The questionnaires were sent out during I936 and 1937, and by February, 1938, answers had been received from 326 per- sons. Although this proportion of responses would seem suffi- ciently large to make the study authentic, the information in our hands is not as full as it could be. Since the tabulations from the questionnaires were completed several library schools have graduated Negroes. We have received only partial infor- mation concerning the present occupations of these graduates and students. Some shifts in positions have occurred, and some Negroes have been employed in city libraries where pro- fessional training outside the library is not necessary for ap- pointment. We do not believe that these factors materially change the main features of this study. Unlike the study made by the Columbia Civic Library As- sociation, this survey included the training and work of all Negroes employed in library work above the position of janitor. In order to include all phases of library work the questionnaires made provision for these occupations: cataloger, classifier, order librarian, circulation librarian, reference librarian, administra- tor, periodical librarian, teachers' reserve librarian, curator or librarian of special collection, departmental clerk, general serv- ice assistant with Grades V-I, senior assistant,junior assistant, page, senior clerk, junior clerk, principal clerk, and part-time 2 U.S. Office of Education (Bull.

NEGRO LIBRARY WORKERS 97 assistant with no special classification. The class "other" was included for those whose positions could not be classified. The questionnaire provided for all essential information con- ceining the worker except that pertaining to salary and age. These items were deemed too personal and were considered un- necessary to make the study valuable. This was especially true with respect to age, because provision was made to ascertain the length of time the worker had been in the library field. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION According to the United States Census, 2IO Negroes were employed in library work in 1930.6 Of these, i8o were women. As previously stated, by February, I938, responses to our ques- tionnaire had been received from 326 Negroes employed in libraries and doing work other than janitorial. Over half of this number (i86) were in southern states, North Carolina leading with 29 and Arkansas reporting 2. The colleges and junior col- leges of the United States employed 9i Negroes as librarians and assistants of various ranks. All these were in Negro insti- tutions, and, in most cases, one librarian performed all the work. The survey showed that in five colleges for Negroes the libraries were headed by white men and women. Eighty Ne- groes served as librarians in the high schools of the country and 2 in elementary schools. The South claimed the largest num- ber of high-school librarians. It was estimated that 175 Negroes were employed by public libraries,7 although only 146 returned questionnaires. This statement is made because correspondence with the two largest cities in the country brought the information that a larger number of Negroes were employed than the returns showed. Of the number employed in public libraries over 6o per cent were in the North. The Library of Congress employed 44 Ne- groes in positions above that of janitor, i5 of whom were in the subordinate messenger service. Two librarians were with CCC 6 U.S. Bureau of the Census, Negroes in the United States, 1920-32 (Washington: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1935), p. 320. 7 Library of Congress employees included.

NEGRO LIBRARY WORKERS 99 in several cities the public branch library was located in the Negro high school and that the library workers were respon- sible to the city system, to the board of education, or to both. Where the information received indicated that the library was a branch-e.g., stayed open when the school was closed and was under the supervision of the public library-it was put with public libraries. Otherwise, it was classed as a high-school li- brary. POSITIONS HELD A variety of occupations in many branches of library work were reported by 308 Negroes. Administrative positions in col- lege, school, and branch libraries were held by I25; and 36 said they were general service assistants.

ioO THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY West furnished employment for i 8 teacher-librarians. In Table 2 is given the distribution by position of those who answered this part of the questionnaire, 177 of whom have the rank of librarian. In addition to the usual occupations of librarians and workers in libraries, 2 were employed as heads of the Colored Department, i as a teacher-registrar-librarian, i as a clerk-librar- ian of a branch, i as the dean of women and librarian in a college, i as head of the photostat division of the Library of Congress, and I as assistant chief of the division of Orientalia in the Library of Congress (he reads and writes Chinese, which he learned under the former chief, Dr. Arthur W. Hummel). The I3I workers were employed as assistants in the usual library occupations. In some city systems Negroes were em- ployed as general service assistants for all the grades from V to I, and some were departmental clerks. From the reports on daily schedules of work it was shown that 252 Negroes were employed full time and 65 for part time. The returns showed that Chicago public libraries and high schools had 25 Negro full-time employees and 6 part-time. The state of North Carolina had i9 for full time and io for part time.

In Table 3 is shown the number of Negro library workers employed full and part time, by type of library. TRAINING OF LIBRARY WORKERS Negroes employed in library work seem to have academic and professional training comparable to that of persons of other races in the profession in America. Of the number answering our questionnaire 170 reported academic degrees earned at 6i colleges and universities of the country; I34 had received the degrees of B.A., Ph.B., or B.Th.; and 3 held LL.B. degrees. In addition, 2 workers held certificates of graduation from nor- mal schools, and I librarian had received the L.I. (Licentiate to instruct) certificate. Of the 61 colleges and universities from which degrees were taken, 34 were Negro institutions. Two librarians reported degrees but did not state the school grant- ing them. In Table 4 we have listed the colleges and universities from which 2 or more Negro library workers received their first de- gree. Schools reported to have conferred degrees on only I Negro library worker include: Alcorn A. & M., Bates College, Bennett College, Boston University, Colorado College, Florida A. & M., Indiana Central University, Indiana State Teachers College, Knoxville College, LeMoyne Teachers College, Lin- coln University of Missouri, Monmouth College, New Orleans University, New York State College, Northwestern University, Oberlin College, Philander Smith College, Samuel Huston Col- lege, Simmons College, South Carolina A. & M., Southern Uni- versity, Stowe Teachers College, Straight College, Tougaloo College, Tufts College, Winston-Salem Teachers College, and the state universities of California, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, and Pennsylvania. The de- grees of A.B. or B.S. were granted in every case except at the University of Michigan, which granted the A.M. degree.

NEGRO LIBRARY WORKERS 103 sum of this information is that 562 persons have spent at least four weeks in training for library work; 307 students have at- tended summer schools; 192 have received first-year degrees in library science; 29 have been members of training classes; 26 library workers have certificates of library science; 8 have di- plomas from library schools; 7 have advanced degrees in li- brary science; and 2 have been special students. A list of schools which have granted library-science degrees to Negroes is given in Table S. In order to simplify the ter- minology of the table, all first-year degrees are entered under "B.S." and the advanced degrees under "A.M.L.S." Some li- brary schools have given diplomas to students at the comple- tion of the first year's work in library science, these diplomas to be superseded by a degree when the required amount of academic credits have been earned. In the case of one gradu- ate of the group from the New York State Library School the entry is under "B.S." although a diploma was granted.

104 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY done because Columbia University has absorbed the New York State Library School. As in Table 4, the schools are listed in descending order of the total number of degrees granted. LENGTH OF TENURE The length of time in library service for the 237 persons who answered the question regarding tenure ranged from less than one year to forty-one years. There were I22 (Si per cent) who had worked five years or less, and 69 (more than 29 per cent) who had worked longer than five years but not more than ten years. When these figures are added to those of recent graduates from library schools, undoubtedly the number of Negroes who are being attracted to library work at present will be rather large. In Table 6 is indicated the length of service in years of these 237 Negro library workers. PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE The reports showed that one-half of the I68 workers who reported upon their experience previous to entering their pres- ent positions came to the library from other fields: 65 were employed in education; I3 were in some phase of business; 4 came from social work; and 2 came from government service. The rest came to their present positions from other libraries, the largest number coming from college libraries. The range of experience of some library workers in previous positions was large. Two librarians were formerly high-school principals; another was an elementary-school principal; I left the deanship of a college; 2 were journalists; I was clerk in a government department in Washington; I was stenographer for TABLE 6 LENGTH OF SERVICE IN YEARS Years ~~Number of Yer Number of Years WVorkers ears Workers Less than i .......... 3 i 6-20 ...... i6 I-5 .................

NEGRO LIBRARY WORKERS los a large insurance company in the Middle West. Several had worked their way up in city systems from low-grade clerk to branch librarian, and a few were departmental assistants in the main libraries of city systems. SIZE OF LIBRARIES EMPLOYING NEGROES Negro libraries and branches employing Negroes are rela- tively small. From 173 reports we found that only i library contained ioo,ooo volumes, i had from 6o0ooo to 75,000 vol- umes, and 3 had from so,ooo to 6o,ooo volumes. Most of the libraries employing Negroes had from I,OOO to 5,ooo volumes; 30 had from 1,ooo to i,50o volumes; and 29 contained from 4,ooo to 5,ooo volumes. The approximate size (by number of volumes owned) of 174 libraries employing Negroes is shown in Table 7. The Library of Congress is listed as having 5,ooo,ooo volumes. Since the questionnaires have been received, several libraries have added hundreds of books to their collections, and some college libraries have entered upon ambitious expansion pro- grams, some of which extend over as many as five years. In several southern states the high schools are increasing their book collections steadily through the aid of Rosenwald and state assistance. Private schools and colleges are putting forth special efforts to increase the book collections of their libraries. The next few years promise large increases in book collections as well as expanded service and larger personnel in Negro li- braries.

io6 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK Although this study of Negro library workers is incomplete, sufficient information has been gathered to warrant some ob- servations. The writer believes that the facts show that more Negroes are employed in library work in positions above that of janitor than is generally known. In northern cities having large Negro populations the public libraries are beginning to employ Negroes in a few branches and, in some cases, in main library buildings. Checking the number of graduates from library schools against those employed in the profession has shown that most Negroes who are qualified have found positions. Approximately 98 per cent of these graduates have been employed in library work since leaving school. Whether we consider the graduates of library schools or training classes, the largest number of Negroes received their training in so-called Negro schools. Al- though Hampton Institute Library School was not opened until September, i925, 184 students have completed courses there. By January, I937, the school had 123 living graduates with de- grees or diplomas, over ioo of whom were in positions in twenty- one states, chiefly in the South, in the District of Columbia, and in the Virgin Islands.8 About 70 per cent of these graduates were in college libraries, i5 per cent in high-school libraries, I2 per cent in public libraries, and a few in other positions. Of the 562 Negroes who received training of any nature in library work 34 per cent studied at Hampton, i i per cent at Columbia University, 9 per cent at Fisk University, 8 per cent at Atlanta University, 8 per cent at Prairie View State Col- lege, 6 per cent at Morehouse-Spelman Summer School, and 4.8 per cent at the University of Illinois. It is understood that the library training here considered includes degree, diploma, certificate courses, and special work and that it is not a picture of the professional librarian but of the library worker. Under- graduate library degrees were received by 197 Negroes from eleven library schools, Hampton leading with I38 or 70 per 8 "Accredited library school histories," Library journal, LXII (I937), 27.
NEGRO LIBRARY WORKERS I0 cent. Columbia University graduated 23 students or I2 per cent, and Illinois is or 8 per cent. A study of the questionnaires shows that Negroes who at- tended the northern schools have generally found work in the North. Library students from southern schools are working mainly in the South, although several are now in the Middle West. Many of the Negroes employed in library work who do not have a degree from a library school are attending school in summer. Those employed in the high schools of many southern cities expect their degrees soon. The summer schools held yearly at Atlanta University, Hampton Institute, Prairie View State College, and Fisk University are preparing many persons now employed for more efficient work. The number of Negro library workers enrolled in these schools during the summer of I938 is shown in Table 8. Several state colleges are giving courses for teacher-librarians in order that those states may prepare librarians for the high schools of the state. All these summer schools may be consid- ered the descendants of the original summer schools held at Hampton and Morehouse-Spelman-the latter registered 34 students for its only session in 1930. A picture of the Negro library worker cannot be easily drawn, but one of the college librarian may be sketched. The average Negro college librarian might be described as a woman with a TABLE 8 NUMBER OF NEGRO LIBRARY WORKERS ENROLLED IN FOUR SCHOOLS DURING SUMMER OF I938 Number of Number of School First-Year Advanced Total Student.

io8 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY B.S. degree from an accredited library school; she adminis- ters, with part-time assistance and student help, a library of from 5,ooo to IO,OOO volumes. She has been in the library field from six to nine years, and the chances are even that she worked in another occupation prior to entering the library field. At the conclusion of this study of Negro library workers, the author finds himself with one thought-the Negro is becoming increasingly important in the library profession. Just as the Negro is receiving more library service, members of his group are being prepared to serve him. In I935 twelve southern states had a Negro population of 8,633,437. Of these, 1,494,982 were within the service area of 77 libraries. This latter number was a large increase over the number served in I926 but still leaves 7,I38,455 or 83 per cent of the Negro population without access to public library service.9 Each year more Negroes are coming within the area of library service with trainied Negroes serving them. In addition, several southern states are raising standards of high schools to require trained librarians or teacher-librarians for high schools accredited by the state. As the Negro enters the library field in larger numbers, he will seek to participate in the professional activities of librar- ians. Already Negro colleges and universities are becoming members of the American Library Association, and the number of individual memberships is increasing. Attendance at annual meetings of the association has doubled in the past year. It is safe to say that in the future Negroes will join the association and will attend the conference in larger numbers. In the past few years workers of this group have become members of several state associations in the North and in the South, where they attend the regular meetings of at least two states. In other states the Negro library workers have separate organizations or have library divisions of state teachers' associations. In all these cases the Negro library worker is forging ahead to take his place by the side of other workers in library service. In the future, complete participation in the professional affairs of the library field may be expected. T. D.
