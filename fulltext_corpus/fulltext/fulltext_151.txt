ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE PERMANENCE OF LIBRARY MATERIALS CARL J. WESSEL1 I. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Protecting library materials against the dangers of environment is a critical problem. Inadvertent misguidance on the subject could hasten damage to val- uable library materials. Most librarians realize this and agree on the need for deep study of the protection of library collections against deteriorative envi- ronments. One of the more encouraging signs in the recent past is the Library of Con- gress brittle book project [1]. The rec- ognition of the importance of the library materials deterioration problem at the level of the Library of Congress, the Association of Research Libraries, and the Council on Library Resources, places the matter at the echelon where adequate attention may be brought to it and the required national effort made to provide the restoration, conservation, and preventive measures required if we are to leave behind us library collec- tions usable in the distant future. This discussion will attempt to inves- tigate environmental factors affecting the permanence of library materials and will try to draw some concepts from the information developed that will length- en the life and usefulness of library collections. It is the objective of this paper to emphasize that deterioration of library materials can arise from inferior operating and storage conditions over both short-term and prolonged periods. It will review some pertinent evidence relating to deterioration originating with air pollution, heat and humidity, light, and biological agents. Focusing for the most part on the environments encountered in American urban research libraries, it will emphasize the effects of temperature, humidity, and such air pol- lutants as ozone, sulfur dioxide, and the nitrogen oxides. Since biological attack is not usually a widespread danger in these libraries, it will be discussed brief- ly. These points will lead to suggestions regarding how librarians may lengthen the useful life of library materials through environmental controls includ- ing some of the details of modern air- conditioning practices, criteria, and specifications. II. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IM- PORTANT IN THE LIBRARY A brief insight into the underlying causes of materials deterioration should prepare us to understand what happens to library materials when they are kept in hostile environments. The term "en- vironment" is used these days in so many connotations that I shall define it as the physical, chemical, and biological 1 I acknowledge with thanks the kind cooperation and assistance of the following people in the prep- aration of this paper: Frazer G.

40 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY elements which make up the space we live and work in and in which we carry out life and civilization as we know them. Usually these physical, chemical, and biological environmental factors bring their degrading effects to bear at a fairly slow rate. Some factors now in- cluded in our broadened concepts of en- vironment damage our library heritage much more rapidly, such as riots, fire, and deliberate destruction.

The factors we are dealing with are energy forms-some of very high pow- er, others of fairly low level. All are capable of bringing about physical or chemical reactions in materials. Usually the reactions are undesirable and de- crease the stability of library materials. Obviously the reason we have libraries is to preserve man's historical records and his thoughts and intellectual crea- tions. Some recorded material has little importance and it does not matter a great deal whether it lasts any longer than the people or events about which it is written. On the other hand, some recorded material has very great impor- tance and should be preserved indefi- nitely. But often we cannot predict the importance of recorded material in ad- vance. Thus, in the past, and even now, we have usually attempted to preserve all records for at least a moderate length of time, or as long as we practically are able, by utilizing the most stable mate- rials known to the art and science of the times. Then we gamble that what is im- portant will be recognized in time to take extra precautions to extend the useful life of the material on which it is recorded or of which it is made. The materials on which we record events or print all manner of things vary greatly in properties and form. Some are rather fugitive in nature and even under good environmental condi- tions are soon unusable. Examples in- clude some of the cheap papers. Other materials are extremely stable and even under rather undesirable environmental conditions will persist for long periods of time-as, for example, certain types of rock. But even the most stable mate- rials are susceptible to some forms of environmental degradation. In the long run it becomes a matter of compromises -choices of materials of practical sta- bility, available in amounts and at costs that can be afforded, and with proper- ties that can be tolerated, and environ- ments for use and storage which tend to reduce physical, chemical, and biologi- cal changes to a minimum. The subject of this discussion is the factors of environment, their composi- tion, the energy properties of environ- mental components, and the ability of these components to react advanta- geously or disadvantageously with the materials of our library collections. In- cluded will be some examples of the effects of poor combinations of mate- rials and environments on the valuable records of our civilization and history. Duncan Cameron in 1968 [2] listed the environments he considers impor- tant to museums. These are shown in table 1. Table 2 shows Cameron's con- cepts of the ideal environment for the museum. His sanguine humor is un- doubtedly shared from time to time by many librarians. The ideal environmen-
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 41 tal conditions for museums approximate those for libraries. If anything, museum people have to consider more environ- mental factors than librarians do be- cause of the greater variety of objects and materials for which they are re- sponsible. In addition, in many cases the museum objects are often much old- TABLE 2 THE IDEAL ENVIRONMENT FOR THE MUSEUM a) Pollutant-free air b) Total darkness c) Constant temperature of 60-68?

For the purposes of this paper the en- vironmental factors of greatest impor- tance to libraries are shown in table 3. Atmospheric environments: Pollu- tants.-The atmosphere is commonly thought of as the gaseous envelope, that is, the air that surrounds the earth. Air has the properties of a mixture rather than those of a compound. A representa- tive composite analysis of dry air is shown in table 4 [3]. The analysis of air is usually made after it has been freed of solids such as dust, spores and bac- teria, and water vapor. Water vapor, or humidity, represents a very important constituent of atmosphere. It will be discussed in this paper as a separate topic because of its great independent influence on library materials. The com- position of air varies with altitude and certain constituents such as ozone may vary considerably. The figures in table 4 may, however, be regarded as repre- sentative of the common components. The atmosphere, especially in our in- dustrialized urban areas, contains a host of other substances, termed pollutants. These pollutants are widespread be- cause the United States is rapidly be- coming almost completely urbanized. In 1920, less than one-half of the 106 mil- lion people of the United States lived in cities. In 1960, city-dwellers made up 70 percent of the 170 million total.

Further- more, the problem of permanence of li- brary materials is made more serious since the largest library collections nat- urally tend to be concentrated in urban areas to serve the greatest concentra- tions of people.

Most pollutants occur in very small concentrations compared with the "nor- mal" atmospheric constituents. Even so, some of these abnormal constituents occur in concentrations high enough to pose serious problems. The subject of air pollutants has been widely docu- mented, especially in the past few years because of the upsurge of governmental and public interest in the subject as it affects man, animals, crops, and mate- rials of all kinds. Stern's 3-volume trea- tise on the subbject of air pollution [5] is authoritative. A recent general review of the subject of pollution is that in Chemical and Engineering News [41; an excellent review of technical infor- mation resources in the air pollution field is presented by Searle [6]. To provide an idea of the dimen- sions of the air pollution problem, the emissions of the principal pollutants in- to the atmosphere in the United States have been estimated by the National Research Council of the National Acad- emy of Sciences to be about 125 million tons per year at the present time [7]. The amounts by types and sources are shown in table 5. Other estimates [4] are as high as 300 million tons per year. Some estimates of particulate matter are considerably higher than those shown in table 5. Haagen-Smit [9] quotes figures for the United States as high as one million tons of pollen, thirty million tons of natural dust, five million tons of smoke (carbon), and ten million tons of industrial dust and ash. Haagen- Smit quotes other interesting figures pertaining to the magnitude of the air pollution problem. For example, he states [10] that dustfall per month per square mile in Los Angeles amounts to twenty to thirty tons, although Los An- geles is considered to be a comparative- ly clean city in this respect; other high- ly industrialized cities receive several times this amount. Carbon monoxide, produced in automobile traffic, reaches concentrations of ten to thirty ppm (parts per million) (vol/vol) and on heavily traveled streets 100 ppm is nor- mal [10]. The worldwide emission of sulfur dioxide from smelters, refineries, and fuel burners would require one mil- lion tank trucks of twenty-ton capacity to transport. This procession would stretch twice around the earth [10]. A complete listing of all substances found as contaminants or pollutants in the atmosphere would require several pages. The Guide and Data Book of the
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 43 American Society of Heating, Refriger- ating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) [ 11, 12] provides an excel- lent listing of the various air pollutants as well as a wide discussion of the prob- lem of air contaminants in general. Table 6 presents a partial listing of pol- lutants. Those representing the greatest known hazard to library materials for the most part are those which are either acidic or oxidizing. Notable deleterious substances in the library and museum fields are sulfur dioxide, the oxides of nitrogen, and ozone. These substances play roles in a rather complicated sys- tem of photochemical atmospheric pol- lutants which are seriously damaging to man, animals, vegetation, and mate- rials. The subject of photochemical air pol- lutants has been reviewed by a number of investigators. For example, Jaffe [13] and Haagen-Smit [9, 10] provide help- ful summaries of a very extensive litera- ture on the subject. Sulfur dioxide, or pollutants containing sulfur dioxide de- rived from coal burning, has been rec- ognized for more than six hundred years as a damaging pollutant in the atmo- sphere [14]. Photochemical air pollu- tion is a fairly recently recognized phe- nomenon, first recognized about twenty- five years ago because of its effect in causing cracking of rubber products and damage to plant species. One of the symptoms of photochemi- cal pollution is the presence of high concentrations of oxidizing substances in the air. Photochemical smog consists of mixtures of gaseous and particulate (aerosol) products resulting from at- mospheric photochemical reactions of gases evolved primarily from the com- bustion of organic fuels [13]. Ultravio- let radiation from sunlight is respon- sible for the initiation of a series of at- mospheric reactions between the oxides of nitrogen and such photochemically reactive substances as olefins, aromatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes, and, to a lim- ited extent, some paraffins [13]. The photochemical oxidants consist of a dynamic complex of oxidizing sub- stances which are not yet completely defined chemically. Because of the prac- tical difficulty of measuring the various oxidizing substances separately, they are usually measured as total oxidant values in the atmosphere. Total oxidant TABLE 6 ATMOSPHERIC SUBSTANCES CONSIDERED AS POLLUTANTS Particulate Matter (Aerosols) Gases Dust, dirt, smoke Carbon monoxide Coal and coke dust Nitric oxide Fly ash Nitrous oxide Salt particles Sulfur dioxide Calcium and ammo- Ozone nium sulfates Olefins Nitrates Aromatic hydro- Chlorides carbons Solid oxides Aldehydes Soot Paraffins Tars Hydrogen sulfide Spores Halogen com- Bacteria pounds Ammonia values as high as 100 parts per hun- dred million or one part per million have been reported in dense photochem- ical smog [ 13 ]. Although it is not a purpose of this discussion to become involved in the de- tailed chemistry of atmospheric oxi- dants, it is interesting to note a few as- pects of present knowledge on the sub- ject. Jaffe's review explains that a num- ber of products are formed in the photochemical smog-forming process through the initiating photo-dissociation of nitrogen dioxide with the concomi- tant formation of atomic oxygen. This permits ozone formation, already pres- ent normally to some extent in the at- mosphere, and known to be a principal oxidizer. In addition, there is formation
44 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY of the strong oxidants, the organic per- oxides, of which the peroxyacyl nitrates have been identified. These comprise a homologous series of organic peroxide nitrogen compounds which have been designated as PaNs compounds; to dis- tinguish the originally discovered per- oxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) from the se- ries, the group designation is now com- monly PaNs. In addition to the fore- going, other unidentified oxidants are formed, oxygenated compounds such as carbonyl compounds (aldehydes and ketones) and certain degradation prod- ucts, such as carbon monoxide and car- bon dioxide. Thus the principal identifi- able photochemical atmospheric pollu- tants are thought to be ozone, the PaNs, and the oxides of nitrogen, chiefly nitro- gen dioxide. The latter, comprising usu- ally about 10 percent of total oxidants, are relatively weak oxidants. Tables 7 and 8 are taken from Jaffe [13]. In these compilations, he presents summaries of values measuring the total oxidizing power of polluted atmospheres in a number of the larger industrialized cities of the United States.

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 45 are the number of days in these cities when the concentrations of total oxi- dants reach the values shown. A seemingly anomalous phenomenon in the air pollution field should be noted. It is especially interesting to the librarian because of the importance of the acidic sulfur dioxide to the degrada- tion of paper. Sulfur dioxide is a reduc- ing substance, while the photochemical air pollutants we have been discussing are oxidizing substances. Ordinarily, one might expect that such oxidants as ozone and sulfur dioxide would react with each other until there is an excess of one or the other. The extreme dilu- tion of these pollutants in the atmo- sphere, however, permits them to co- exist, and one may note oxidizing and reducing degradation phenomena simul- taneously. The situation is rather easily understood when one considers reaction rates in relation to the small concentra- tions of reactants. Whereas in fairly high concentrations, a reaction would proceed in perhaps a few thousandths of a second, in the extremely low con- centrations of air pollutants a similar reaction might require an hour [ 10]. Atmospheric factors: humidity.- Water occurs in all the normal states of matter-solid, liquid, and gas. It also takes many forms-ice, snow, glaze, sleet or hail, ice fog, liquid water, rain, water in the aerosol form of fog or mist, and finally water vapor. Water vapor is water in the gaseous phase and is usual- ly referred to in terms of humidity. For the consideration of the librarian, water vapor is the most important form of water. The materials of the librarian- his buildings, his collections, and prac- tically all that he works with, are pro- tected, for the most part, against all forms of water except water vapor. The following discussion considers water only in the vapor form and will omit the less usual albeit devastating damage which may come about from such phe- nomena as floods or water damage caused by sprinkler systems and the like. Humidity measurements include ab- solute and relative humidity. Absolute humidity is measured in terms of the mass of water vapor per unit volume of natural air. Relative humidity expresses the ratio of the actual water vapor con- tent of the air to its total capacity at a given temperature. The warmer the air, the greater amount of water vapor it is TABLE 9 ABSOLUTE HuMIDITY (g/kg) ? c ?F RH-20% RH=60% RH-100% 0 32 0.38 2.28 3.82 20 68 1.43 8.69 14.61 40 104 4.55 28.30 48.64 60 140 12.50 83.55 152.45 SouRcz.-Plenderleitb and Philippot [15, pp. 243-891. capable of holding. When air holds as much water vapor as it is capable of holding at that temperature, it is said to be saturated, and is at its dew point. An enlightening way of showing the relations between temperature, relative humidity, and absolute humidity is that of table 9 taken from Plenderleith and Philippot [15]. This shows how the ac- tual amount of water in the atmosphere increases, for a given relative humidity, as the temperature rises. The effect of humidity on library materials is more important than on li- brary workers or patrons. Nonetheless, because temperature and humidity con- ditions in libraries are usually chosen with both materials and people in mind, a few remarks should be made about factors of human comfort. Cold air with high humidity feels colder than dry air
46 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY of the same temperature. On the other hand, hot air with high relative humid- ity feels warmer than it actually is. These effects are due to a combination of heat conduction from the body at the temperatures and humidities involved as well as the cooling effect on the body brought about by evaporation of water from body surfaces. The feeling of com- fort or discomfort experienced by man is then a result of both temperature and humidity. The U.S. Weather Bureau has developed a temperature-humidity or comfort index which gives values in the 70-80-range, reflecting outdoor at- mospheric conditions of temperature and humidity as a measure of comfort or discomfort in warm weather. This in- dex, Ith, is measured as follows: Ith = 0.4 (dry bulb temp. F? + wet bulb temp. F?) + 15. When this index value is 70 most people feel comfortable; at 75 about half the population is satisfied; at 80 most peo- ple are uncomfortable. Without unnec- essarily oversimplifying a subject which is complex at best, man is an aqueous creature. In order to exist in his most healthy state he must maintain a proper water balance with his surroundings. This may sometimes require humidity conditions which would be considered a bit on the uncomfortable side. He can- not suffer dehydration of any magnitude for more than short time periods with- out serious physiological effects. The various materials the librarian is dealing with daily also must remain in equilibrium with the proper humidity in order to retain their most desirable properties and endure for long periods of time. These conditions are not neces- sarily the same for all library materials. It stands to reason that conditions must be chosen so that most materials in- volved are in or near some reasonably favorable range of humidity. When considering the matter of hu- midity and temperature with reference to the possible damaging effects of the heat and water on objects (books, manuscripts, museum items, etc.), it is very important to remember that it is the temperature and humidity condi- tions of the object which control dete- rioration reactions. These conditions are not always the same as the measured ambient or atmospheric conditions, ex- cept when they are under constant con- trol. For example, in a library, if an ob- ject such as a book is at a temperature higher or lower than that of the air in the library, the relative humidity of the layer of air close to the book will differ considerably from that of the ambient room air. This has given rise to the term "object humidity" [12], which, of course, refers to the relative humidity of the thin film of air in closest contact with the surface of the book. If the tem- perature conditions in a library vary greatly over the period of a day, relative humidities thought to be in the safe range of perhaps 45-55 percent can rise to much higher humidities conducive to mildew or other damage to books, pa- per, leather, and other objects. The nature of water makes it impor- tant both as a chemical agent and as a physical agent. Often it acts in both roles simultaneously. For example, when water dissolves carbon dioxide, a small amount of the water actually re- acts chemically to form the compound H2C03. Most of the water, however, plays the physical role of acting as a solvent medium for ionization and the production of hydrogen ions, respon- sible for the acidic properties of the so- lution. Water may be regarded as ex- tremely active in promoting reactions between other substances, entering into
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 47 chemical reactions itself, and serving as the medium for the interaction of nu- merous otherwise inert substances. Among its most important roles, wa- ter is required for the hydration of many substances in everyday life. Some of these roles are not completely under- stood, and often not sufficiently appre- ciated. The role of water as a plasticizer for certain materials such as nylon is important in preserving the properties of the substance over long periods. The maintenance of proper water levels in paper, wood, and leather, to mention a few materials, is absolutely required to prevent drying out with consequent brittleness and eventual disintegration. The discovery of ancient records or his- torical and art objects usually poses se- vere restoration problems; at least par- tial rehydration must occur before the objects can be handled to any great ex- tent or studied and exhibited. Although the objects have endured because they were dry and undisturbed, to be of practical value they must (if possible) be restored to a water content conso- nant with usable properties. On the other hand, the presence of excessive water in materials can bring about destruction. Some constituents of materials such as dyes and adhesives may be dissolved out. Other components may become hydrated to the point of becoming pulp as in the case of cellu- losic materials in paper. Excess water may cause some materials to act as ad- hesives, causing pages of paper to stick together almost beyond separation. Excessive water may also bring about the completely different problem of bio- logical attack. This is usually mani- fested as the growth of fungi or mil- dew, and is accompanied by the charac- teristic musty odor, but more impor- tantly by staining of paper, leather, and other materials. Weakening or even de- struction of the materials results if the organisms are permitted to progress too far. To provide some idea of the relative humidity, precipitation, and tempera- ture in typical cities in the United States, table 10 is included. These data are adapted in part from an earlier pub- lication [16]. The cities included are Chicago, Cincinnati, Denver, Los An- geles, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Saint Louis, and Washington, D.C., to provide data on the same cities as in tables 7 and 8. Table 11 summarizes the mean relative humidity conditions for these cities. The data in these tables should be viewed only as generally indicative. A more complete set of data would also in- clude values for the saturated vapor pressure, for vapor pressure, for depres- sion of wet bulb, and for dew point. The original reference should be consulted for those data. There are many other factors which play a part in determin- ing the real significance of the climatic environment of a given location. Ele- ments which are important include local variations in conditions. For example, we all know that rainfall is measured at relatively few spots for a given city. In large cities it may simultaneously be raining in some sections but not in other sections. Humidity and temperature conditions may vary from place to place depending upon such factors as exis- tence of local bodies of water, vegeta- tion, and protection from sun. Daily ranges vary from spot to spot. In ex- treme climates, such as in the desert, precipitation values may not have much significance. For example, there may be long periods of no rainfall at all.

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 49 greatly from spot to spot and from one time to another. The relationship between absolute and relative humidity must also be kept in mind. Trewartha [ 171 makes the in- teresting observation that in compari- son with air at Madison, Wisconsin, air at Yuma, Arizona, contains nearly as much moisture in July and twice as much moisture in January. Yet the rela- tive humidity figures for Yuma are only two-thirds to one-half the magnitude of those for Madison. Evaporation rate, which is dependent not upon actual amounts of moisture in the air but rath- er upon relative humidity, is high in the desert, which accounts in a large part for the dryness of the climate. Nonetheless these data will give an idea of the mean conditions for the cities listed and some insight into the conditions of humidity faced over the year by their library collections. Radiant energy.-Of all of the chem- ical and physical agents of deteriora- tion, sunlight probably accounts for the most widespread destruction of mate- rials outdoors. Materials used mainly indoors for the most part are protected from the powerful effects of solar radia- tion. Nonetheless, they are subject to damage by the radiant energy of nat- ural light entering the building via windows, skylights, and doors, and by artificial sources of illumination. Thus, although light is not regarded as being as damaging to library collections as some other deteriorative factors, it is certainly worthy of considerable atten- tion. The effectiveness of radiant energy as an agent of deterioration is explained by the fact that some portions of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum are able to bring about photochemical reac- tions with the materials being irradiated either alone or in the presence of other agents like moisture or oxygen. For details of the photochemical phe- nomena which are involved in materials deterioration the reader is referred to earlier reviews [16, 18]. The barest de- tails are mentioned here to provide a generalized discussion. Sunlight, or so- lar radiation, and certain sources of ar- tificial light are important in photo- chemical and photosensitized reactions because they are the sources of the radi- ant energy which make the reactions possible. In nonphotochemical reac- tions, the energy is provided by heat. Solar radiations comprise wave- lengths from about 1,500 to 1,200,000 TABLE 11 MEAN RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR SEVERAL CITIES Cincin- Los Phila- San Saint Washing- Month Chicago Denver. . nati _q Angeles delphia Francisco Louis ton, D.C.

50 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY Angstrom units (A) in the electromag- netic spectrum. Figure 1 illustrates the electromagnetic spectrum [19]. Radia- tion is classified according to wave- lengths, the shortest of which are as low as 10-14 cm and the longest are mea- sured in km. The shortest are known as cosmic rays, followed by gamma radia- tion, X-rays, ultraviolet rays, visible light, infrared rays, radio waves, and radiations from power lines, the last having wavelengths measured in kilo- meters. Of solar radiations, about 99 percent of the energy lies between wavelengths of 1,500 and 40,000 A. About half the energy is in the visible region between 3,800 and 7,700 A, and the other half in the invisible ultraviolet and infrared regions. Two fundamental laws of photo- chemistry are at work in photochemical reactions. The first law states that light must be absorbed by the reacting atoms or molecules; the second law states that one molecule of a reacting substance may be activated by the absorption of one light quantum. A light quantum is the smallest amount of energy that can be removed from a beam of light by any material system. Whereas a molecule can absorb multiples of quanta it can- not absorb less than one. The power or energy of this quantum unit is expressed by the term kv, where h is Planck's con- stant or approximately 6.6 X 1027 erg sec and v is the frequency of the par- ticular light. The energy of quanta in long wavelength radiation ranges (low frequency radiation) such as infrared, is much lower than that in the short wavelength (high frequency) radiation ranges, such as ultraviolet. We can now relate to the energy re- quired for chemical reactions to pro- ceed. Most chemical reactions which proceed with reasonably slow rates at room temperature require about 25 kilocalories (kcal) per gram-molecule for activation. Those reactions which go on only at very high temperatures may require as much as 100 kcal per gram molecule or even more. For the break- ing of bonds between atoms such as car- bon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds, 84 and 100 kcal, respectively, are re- quired [18]. Table 12 [20] shows why radiation in the short wavelength re- gions such as blue green to ultraviolet are required to activate the majority of photochemical reactions, and why these wavelengths are so important to the ma- terials deterioration problem. In the longer wavelength (low frequency) ranges of the solar spectrum, as with infrared, the energy of quanta is rela- to * * V 0 z0 0 - - *0 - t,f t K---L X-RAYL-- - _---- --HERTAN-- ---f RAYS;P L-ULTH R INFRARDAW VIOLET VISIBLE FIG. 1.-The electromagnetic spectrum.

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 51 tively small. In this range, quanta can influence vibrations and rotation and thus heat molecules, but they cannot provide enough energy to overcome the forces which hold atoms of the mole- cules together. In the visible and espe- cially the ultraviolet ranges of the spec- trum, chemical bonds can be broken. These reactions are limited in the at- mosphere only by the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere which does not per- mit radiation of wavelengths below 2,900 A to reach the earth's surface [18]. An informative example of the com- parative damaging effect and the lumi- nosity of radiant energy is provided in table 13. This is taken from a report by the National Bureau of Standards [21], describing work done in connection with preservation of the Declaration of TABLE 12 ENERGY IN VARIOUS TYPES OF RADIATION Description Wavelength Fruen Calory/ Descrlptlon (A) Feuny Einstein X-rays....... 1 3 X 1018 2.84X 108 Ultraviolet.... 1,000 3X 106 284,500 Ultraviolet.... 2,000 1.5X10'5 142,300 Ultraviolet.... 3,000 1X 10 94,840 Visible (violet). 4,000 7. 5X 1014 71, 120 Visible (blue green) 5 ,000 6X 1014 57,000 Visible (orange) 6,000 5X 1014 47,400 Visible (red).. 7,000 4.3X 1014 40,600 Visible (red)... 8,000 3. 7X 1014 35,500 Near infrared.. 10,000 3 X1014 28,450 Infrared ...... 100,000 3 X 10'a 2,845 Far infrared. . . 1,000,000 3 X 10" 284 SouRcE.-Duggar [201.

Animal parchment deterioration under light is not as rapid as is the case with this sample of paper. The influence of wave- length of the radiatiQn on ability to de- stroy the paper is clearly demonstrated. In summary, in photochemical reac- tions the energy supplied by radiation must first be absorbed and may result in displacement of electrons in the reac- tants. If the energy of electronic excita- tion displaces atoms within a molecule, TABLE 13 COMPARISON OF DAMAGE AND USEFULNESS FACTORS OF RADIANT ENERGY Wavelength Relative Damage Relative Luminosity (mA) Factors Factors (Usefulness) 360 .145 0.0000 380 .107 0.0000 400 .66 0.0004 420 .37 0.0040 440 .20 0.023 460 .12 0.060 480 6.5 0.139 500 3.7 0.323 520 2.1 0.710 540 1.2 0.954 560 ... 0.7 0.995 580 0.4 0.870 600 0.2 0.631 620 0.1 0.381 640 0 .05 0.175 660 0 0.061 680 0 0.017 700 0 0.004 720 0 0.001 SouacE.-National Bureau of Standards 121, p. 61. chemical reaction may take place. If the atomic displacement is large enough the molecule may dissociate. If atoms are displaced, but not enough to be ex- pelled, molecular reactions may occur. The energy of the particular radiation must be at least as great as or greater than the energy of activation of the re- action. Whether activation and reac- tion occur depends not upon the total amount of energy in a beam of radia- tion but rather upon the intensity of the radiation, that is, the amount of energy per quantum. Radiant energy: keat.-Heat is an environmental factor. It is difficult to visualize any phenomena in the mate- rial world which does not involve heat
52 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY or cold in some way, for the complete absence of heat would be that point at which there is no molecular motion- absolute zero or 01 K. Heat is the ener- gy a body possesses because its mole- cules are in motion. Except at absolute zero, there is always some heat in a body, and for our purposes we should think in terms of how much heat is available rather than whether or not there is heat in a body. Heat, and its correlative, cold, or the absence of heat, act as powerful agents of chemical and physical deterioration for two basic rea- sons. First, the physical properties of almost all materials are greatly influ- enced by changes in temperature, and second, the rates of almost all chemical reactions are greatly affected by the temperature of the reactants. The concepts of heat and tempera- ture are often confused. Temperature, or the degree of heat content of a body, is a function of the speed of motion of the molecules in the body. Heat depends upon both the speed of motion and the number of molecules. Thermodynamically, heat is defined as energy in transmission because of a temperature gradient. Heat then may be viewed as the energy which passes from one body to another because of differences in temperature. These bodies may be gases, liquids, or solids, or any combination of these states of matter. There are three modes of transmis- sion of heat-convection, conduction, and radiation. All three affect the per- manence of library materials. Convec- tion is the process of transmitting heat by means of the movement of heated matter from one place to another, and takes place in liquids and gases. The heating of a building with a hot air fur- nace is a good example of convection. The air heated by the furnace expands, becomes less dense than the cold air above it, rises, and thus causes move- ment of heat throughout the building by currents of heated air. Conduction is the process of transfer- ring heat from one molecule to another. An example of this is heating a bar of metal in a flame. As the molecules near- est the heat of the flame are heated and move more rapidly from the heat, they strike adjacent molecules. These in turn strike more molecules and the heat is transmitted throughout the bar of met- al. Radiant energy was discussed briefly in the section on light. Heat is also transmitted by radiation. Whereas in the cases of convection and conduction, heat is transmitted via material media, radiant energy may be transmitted through space in the form of waves. This radiant energy, falling upon a body causes molecular motion with the resultant heating of the body. As in the case of most other environ- mental factors, heat rarely acts alone. Its deleterious effects are usually ac- companied by other factors such as humidity, sunlight, pollutants, biologi- cal agents, and the like. Changes in temperature are often very damaging to materials because of expansion or con- traction of the materials with conse- quent cracking. The action of heat in driving off water, or other solvents and plasticizers, and the consequent brittle- ness often destroys paper, leather, some plastics, and other materials. Heat plays a very important part in affecting the speed of chemical reactions. An increase of 10? F roughly doubles the rate of many chemical reactions. Included in these may be reactions with air pollu- tants. Holding materials at low tem- peratures is often an acceptable method of prolonging useful life. The influence of heat on the water
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 53 content of materials and of the atmo- sphere is important in the problem of permanence. With a given water con- tent of the atmosphere, a sudden drop in temperature will bring about a rise in relative humidity. If the rise of humid- ity is sufficient, condensation of the wa- ter in the air can occur, covering sur- faces with liquid water. If this occurs often enough or for a sufficient time, water damage to susceptible materials can result. Condensation due to tem- perature changes in air-cooled buildings is discussed in considerable detail by Verrall [22]. This article is recom- mended especially for study by those responsible for libraries in older build- ings or in small wooden buildings and buildings with crawl spaces. Specific recommendations are made for the stor- age of photographic film. Finally, the influence of heat in com- bination with biological agents cannot be overlooked. Although humidity is a much more important environmental factor in occurrence of and damage by microbiological agents, heat does play a part even with these organisms. Heat plays an even more important part with the macrobiological agents-insects and rodents. Biological agents.-Biological agents do not cause great damage in the major- ity of urban libraries in the United States. However, this should not be mis- understood to mean that the biological deterioration problem no longer exists in any urban libraries or is not a serious source of trouble in some libraries throughout the world. The problem of deterioration of books and archival ma- terials caused by biological agents often becomes of great importance in some countries. Certainly if one includes mu- seums along with libraries, biological agents assume tremendous importance in damaging historic and artistic cul- tural works. Museums, of course, com- monly include in their collections many materials rarely (if ever) found in li- braries; many of these are particularly susceptible to damage by biological agents. It is of the greatest importance to be aware of infestations of certain microbiological and biological agents when newly discovered materials are brought into museums and/or libraries. It is essential that such materials be treated to destroy the organisms before they enter the collections. Although many of our modern urban libraries do not have large rare book collections, it is nonetheless essential that newly in- troduced materials of often uncertain history and composition be examined and treated adequately before accep- tance. The subject of biological agents with reference to libraries and museums has been reviewed many times with consid- erable authority [16, 23, 24, 25, 26]. Fungi, bacteria, and actinomycetes are the organisms referred to as microbio- logical agents in libraries and museums. In small numbers, they are usually too small to be studied by the naked eye. In sufficiently large numbers their col- onies are, of course, visible. Theoret- ically, the bacteria could be of impor- tance to libraries. However, few (if any) cases of bacteria damage have been recorded, although there are bac- teria which can attack cellulosic materi- als such as in paper and do considerable damage. Library environmental condi- tions are not conducive to such attack. There are a few cases of actinomycetes being found in libraries [16, 23, 27, 28]. The fungi constitute the most impor- tant of the microbiological agents to the librarian, for the most part because, compared with bacteria, they thrive best in relatively dry conditions. That is to say, although fungi require high
54 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY relative humidities, they do not thrive well in the presence of liquid water. Bacteria, on the other hand, require comparatively aqueous conditions for growth and multiplication. The fungi are extremely numerous in genera and species and are ubiquitous. Spores of fungi are to be found just about anywhere under, on, and above the earth, and await only the proper conditions of moisture, temperature, and sometimes light, to vegetate, grow, and reproduce. It is perfectly safe to state that every library in the world is liberally seeded with perhaps hundreds of genera and species of fungi. Thus, the important idea in control of fungi is to maintain temperature and humidity conditions at levels not conducive to growth of the microorganisms. This does not mean that cleanliness and re- moval of dust and dirt do not assist in reduction of the fungal problem, but it does mean that cleanliness is only part of the story. There are numerous genera and spe- cies of fungi. Table 14 presents only a very approximate idea of the various genera which have been identified on materials in libraries, chiefly on paper. These data have been gathered together from a few of the very large number of references on the subject [16, 24, 26- 37], but probably the most important genera of fungi which endanger libraries are represented. The growth and reproduction of fun- gi are influenced by a number of envi- ronmental factors-temperature, rela- tive humidity, light, oxygen, and nutri- ents. Fungi are more tolerant of rel- atively wide temperature ranges than they are of wide ranges in other envi- ronmental factors. That is, they may be expected to be viable at unexpectedly low and unexpectedly high tempera- tures. Three temperatures are impor- tant to growth and reproduction-the temperature below which growth and reproduction do not occur,;the tempera- ture range at which most rapid growth takes place, and the temperature above which no growth occurs. Fungi have been found to grow at temperatures near freezing as well as those as high as 50-55? C.

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 55 fungi is common as witness events which often occur in your refrigerator. The temperature range for optimal growth and reproduction is variable, depending upon genera and species of fungi but are approximately 15 ?-35 C or about 59?-95? F. The average opti- mum temperature is about 860 F, when the relative humidity is 95-100 percent. The absence of growth and reproduc- tion at low temperature does not signify the death of fungal spores. Many spe- cies will withstand prolonged periods of freezing or subfreezing temperatures and, upon restoration to favorable tem- peratures, they are able again to grow and reproduce. However, alternation of below-freezing and above-freezing tem- peratures is not tolerated well by most species. High temperatures-especially high temperatures combined with moist conditions-will kill most fungi and fungal spores. In order to consistently kill fungal spores, steam pressure at 15 pounds per square inch, or 2500 F, for 15 minutes is required. Relative humidity is very important to growth of fungi. Generally it is be- lieved that below 70 percent relative hu- midity (RH) there is little opportunity for growth. At 80-95 percent RH most forms grow well; above 95 percent RH growth is luxurious. However, the com- bination of temperature and relative humidity is important. Optimum hu- midity at 860 F is between 95 and 100 percent RH. Optimum temperature at close to 100 percent RH is about 1000 F. Optimum temperature at lower hu- midities, for example, 70 percent RH, is considerably lower. Light does not appear to be an essen- tial requirement for most fungi. Gen- erally, fungi will grow either in the light or dark. Certain band-widths of ultraviolet light are injurious or even lethal to fungi. Other parts of the elec- tromagnetic spectrum (X-rays) are ca- pable of causing mutations in fungal organisms, giving rise to new species which may have considerably different characteristics such as nutrient require- ments. The characteristics of light in libraries do not appear, therefore, to be of any consequence to the fungal prob- lem. Certain workers have attempted to use portions of the electromagnetic spectrum to control organisms in li- braries as witness the work of Belyako- va with gamma radiation on fungi in the Lenin State Library [36]. Although there are many bacteria which can thrive under anaerobic con- ditions, most fungi require oxygen for growth. This requirement has no influ- ence on the library problem. Fungi re- quire several nutrients, some of which do have an influence on growth in li- braries. Required are carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus. Some trace elements may also be required such as iron, zinc, copper, manganese, and in some cases calcium. Certain of the vitamins are al- so needed. These nutrients may be pro- vided in many forms; for example car- bon may be provided in the form of carbohydrate. The inorganic require- ments may be in the form of salts of metallic elements. Nitrogen is essential, in the reduced form of ammonium ion, as oxidized nitrate, or in organic form of amino acids or proteins. The fungal nutrient problem is inter- esting to the librarian for several rea- sons. Certain fungi will consume cellu- lose and can therefore do irreparable damage to paper. Others thrive on the nutrients in leather, glues, pastes, and other adhesives, or on binding threads. Some, though not consuming constit- uents of books or other library materi- als, stain surfaces because of metabolic products, such as the red water-soluble
56 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY dye produced by Gymnoascus setosus [35]. As noted in the section on air pollu- tants, many of the constituents of pol- luted atmospheres, especially the par- ticulate matter, are the salts and organ- ic matter needed by fungi. It is impor- tant to control air pollution, not only to prevent soiling or even chemical reac- tion with library materials, but also to reduce provision of microbiological nu- trients. Numerous orders, families, genera, and species of insects are dangerous to libraries. Like the microbiological agents, insects are not considered to be a major problem in most urban Ameri- can libraries. Cleanliness, awareness, and periodic inspections rather easily control insects, and they can be eradi- cated by fumigation or by the applica- tion of insecticides. But they should not be ignored as potential problems. In- sects can be brought in by careless pa- trons and many thoughtless library users leave insect attractants, such as uneaten food, candy wrappers and simi- lar materials in books. The danger of introducing insect infestations into li- braries through acquisitions of old col- lections from poorly kept quarters makes it mandatory to sterilize such materials before adding them to shelves or storage areas. Table 15 indicates the varieties of insects which, from time to time, have been encountered in various libraries around the world. Also shown are types of materials which may be attacked.

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 57 environmental, respiratory, or nutri- tional requirements of these many in- sects. Since these factors vary widely, suffice it to say that insects are found under numerous combinations of cli- matic conditions and occurrence of nu- tritional factors, from extremely dry to hot and humid. Low temperatures, how- ever, discourage most insects. III. THE EFFECTS OF IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTS Atmospheric pollutants.-Atmospher- ic pollutants are important to the li- brarian not only because of their physi- ological effects on himself and his cli- ents but because of their deteriorating effects on the materials in his collections and the great trouble and costs required to protect against them. Thomson [44] recently reviewed the subject of air pol- lution as it pertains to conservation chemists. This article is recommended for review by all librarians and museum curators interested in protecting their collections. The public as well as government officials in the United States have been awakened to the fact that the air pollu- tion problem is of vast importance to all aspects of American life and far-reach- ing programs have already begun to alleviate the problem. However, the problem is still with us and we must be aware of the damage which has already been done and continues to occur. Particulate matter in the air is one problem. Even though some programs successfully reduce or eliminate the emission of particulate matter by in- dustrial emitters such as chimneys and stacks, common dust, dirt, sand, and other finely divided particulates are caught up from streets, buildings, fields, and other sources and blown about by winds. Thus, librarians must always be prepared either to clean up such ma- terials from library collections by dust- ing or use of vacuum cleaners or they must prevent the particulates from en- tering buildings by using high efficiency filters. A glance at table 6 reminds us of the types of particulate matter. Although much flying dust and dirt is quite dry- that is why it is so easily picked up by the wind-it can still soil surfaces such as book pages and bindings. If condi- tions are moist, such dirt can stain the materials and be difficult to remove. If it comprises nutrients for fungi, and if conditions are moist, such dirt can re- sult in the growth of mildew with con- sequent staining and discoloration of paper or other materials. The abrasive action of dust and dirt on paper and other library materials such as leather is also a serious deterioration problem. If dust or dirt carries acidic or al- kaline substances and conditions are moist, it can alter the pH of paper or other materials and cause deterioration. One of the most important deteriora- tion problems facing librarians today and well into the future is the deteriora- tion of book paper as a consequence of improper acid content. This is not sole- ly an environmental problem, since it has arisen primarily from methods of manufacture of the papers which have gone into books all over the world for a very considerable time. Yet, part of the problem is environmental and thus a proper subject for inclusion in this dis- cussion. That is to say, part of the li- brary deterioration problem which oc- curs today, and has for the past several hundred years, is caused by the pres- ence of acidic components in the atmo- sphere, especially sulfur dioxide. The contemporary nitrogen oxide problem in the polluted atmosphere of many of our cities gives rise to some nitric acid. This too adds to the hydrolytic degra-
58 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY dation of paper. This part of the dis- cussion will pertain chiefly to the effects of sulfur dioxide and to the acid-sul- furic acid-which arises through oxida- tion and solvation from sulfur dioxide. The subject of permanence of paper, as well as of many other materials of interest to the librarian, has a very large literature. There are, of course, many reviews and texts on the subject which should be consulted [16, 24, 25, 26, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55]. Some of these works are on the general subject of "aging" and include much more than the effects of acid, such as heat aging, light effects, biological damage, the effect of paper composition, and miscellaneous causes of deteriora- tion of paper, other library materials, and even museum collections. The subject of paper impermanence due to high acid content is treated au- thoritatively by Smith in a recent re- view [45]. There does not appear to be any question that high acidity causes paper impermanence. There have been numerous investigations of the subject and the evidence is overwhelming. The deterioration which occurs is character- ized as hydrolytic and is chiefly an at- tack, catalyzed by the hydronium ions produced from acid substances, on the cellulose which comprises the chief fi- brous ingredient of paper. The rate of deterioration increases with hydronium ion concentration, that is, with a lower- ing of the pH values of the paper as measured on a water extract. The de- terioration is manifested by a decrease in the strength (tear-resistance) of the paper and loss of flexibility (folding en- durance). A very considerable portion of the acidity in papers can come from the materials used in manufacturing, chief- ly the alum-rosin sizing. This is dis- cussed in some depth by Smith [45], who cites the outstanding works on the subject. Among others, the reader is referred to the extensive work of Bar- row [56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63]. Barrow was one of the first modern re- search workers to recognize in an effec- tive way that the acidity which was really built into the paper as a conse- quence of the constituents used in the manufacturing process is more impor- tant than the acidity of polluted atmo- spheres. Some earlier workers had, of course, discussed the matter. According to Smith, at the turn of the twentieth century, experts thought that a mini- mum pH of 4.0 for a hot water extract from first-class, permanent book paper was acceptable. We now know that this is much too acid and that paper with this acid content will embrittle quickly with time. The opinions about the pH value re- quired for stable permanent papers al- tered as time passed. Smith points out that, by 1928, workers claimed that the pH of hot water extracts should be at least 4.5 and preferably above 4.7. By 1936, it was recognized that hot water extracts with a pH of less than 5.0 was a major cause of deterioration in even the best classes of paper. According to Smith, in 1937, Grant claimed a mini- mum hot water pH of 6.0 to be neces- sary for permanent printing papers. Lewis [64] in 1959 reported on a test commenced in 1934 in which the hot water extract pH of the three good pa- pers used were 6.4, 6.3, and 5.7. Smith further discusses the most desirable hy- drogen-ion conditions for permanent paper and leaves the impression that hot water pH extract values should ap- proximate neutrality, that is pH 7.0, or even be on the alkaline side of neutral- ity.2 Although acidic components of paper 'Other considerations in addition to permanence pertain to the pH problem and are discussed by other speakers of this conference.
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 59 play a major role in paper hydrolysis and deterioration, the acidic compo- nents of polluted atmospheres cannot be dismissed. There is excellent evi- dence that atmospheres containing S02 can lower paper-folding endurance as much as 15 percent in ten days, when the S02 concentrations approximate what might be expected in badly pol- luted cities. Slow oxidation of the car- bohydrates of paper with the produc- tion of carboxylic acids and an accom- panying production of hydronium ions or decrease in pH occurs in accelerated aging of papers and presumably in nat- ural aging. Acidity due to sulfur emissions is usually produced by sulfur dioxide. This oxide forms sulfurous acid when in contact with water. In order to form sulfuric acid, a much stronger acid and oxidizing agent than sulfurous acid, it is necessary for sulfur dioxide to be oxi- dized to sulfur trioxide. When sulfur dioxide is emitted from stacks or chim- neys, for example, it is almost imme- diately oxidized to sulfur trioxide, prob- ably catalyzed by ash constituents [5]. The sulfuric acid formed from sulfur trioxide in the presence of water is largely responsible for the bluish smokes typical of what is called "sulfur diox- ide" emissions [5]. In areas where strongly oxidizing materials, such as ni- trogen dioxide, ozone, peroxides, and the peroxy-free radicals are present, more rapid oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide may be expected. Au- tomobile exhaust and also olefins in the presence of nitrogen oxides also appear to cause more rapid sulfur dioxide oxi- dation by the photochemically produced oxidants [5]. The presence of iron and manganese salts also materially in- creases S02 oxidation to S03 [5]. For some time, there was some ques- tion whether sulfur dioxide pollution of the atmosphere could cause paper de- terioration in books. Smith [45] quotes from Jarrell, Hankins, and Veitch who demonstrated, however, that all kinds of paper in books will pick up enough acidity by S02 penetration throughout an exposed book to have devastating effects on permanence. Although the position of the page in the book and the distance from the edge of the page has an influence, no parts of the paper ap- pear to escape deteriorating effects. Hudson [65], using a flat glass elec- trode and a small amount of water for each sample, was able to measure the pH of samples of twenty-five books, varying from 150 to 350 years of age. His results confirmed that atmospheric pollution is one of the causes of low pH values, particularly at the edges of pages. His nondestructive method of pH measurement is easily applied and should be considered by anyone inter- ested in the acidity of the book papers in his library collection. Hudson and his co-workers [51, 66] developed a method for measuring the affinity of sulfur dioxide for paper and for examining the effects of such vari- ables as temperature and humidity on this affinity. The method uses sulfur dioxide containing radioactive sulfur (S85) so that its presence and migration may be detected and measured easily. They found that even good quality pa- pers easily pick up sulfur dioxide, at concentrations which can be expected in the atmosphere of any normal city. The moisture content of the paper is closely related to the rate of sulfur dioxide pickup and this rate is increased by storage under damp conditions. High pickup is also favored by high ambient temperatures. They point out that con- ditions in books would be different than their tests with single sheets, since the paper in books is protected by the edges. Other studies have shown, how- ever, that there is diffusion of acid into
60 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY the body of books. Still other investiga- tions have shown that chemicals can migrate from one page to another or from one document to another [67]. Langwell [50, 52] in his investiga- tions of a simple and effective test for sulfur dioxide, and development of methods for protecting books and other library materials against it, stated that S02 itself is not damaging to paper. But it combines readily, in the presence of metallic impurities, to form sulfuric acid, which is seriously detrimental. These metallic impurities occur in most modern papers and in many papers made after the middle of the eighteenth century. Parchments, vellums, and pa- pers made before or about 1750, may usually be regarded as immune to this attack. The role of the nitrogen oxides in the deterioration of paper and other library materials has not been investigated as extensively as that of the sulfur oxides. In addition to the role of helping oxidize sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide, the ni- trogen oxides can themselves play an important part in deterioration. This deterioration extends beyond paper and into the realm of other polymeric ma- terials used in libraries such as rubber adhesives, and synthetic elastomers used as fabrics, threads, and adhesives. The nitrogen oxides are being investi- gated extensively in modern air pollu- tion problems and it is hoped that they will be investigated at greater length in library problems. Although it is not properly a subject in this discussion for detailed presenta- tion, there are suitable methods for the deacidification of paper. This material has been covered in publications of Bar- row [61] and recent papers of Smith [68, 69]. Sulfur acids also play an important part in the deterioration of leather [16, 33, 70]. Many old leathers are more acidic than fresh leathers. What has been referred to as "red rot" is actually an acidic deterioration. Sulfur dioxide, from polluted atmospheres, catalyzed at the leather surface to sulfur trioxide, subsequently converted to sulfuric acid, is thought to be the degrading agent. This form of deterioration is very dam- aging to the leather and can cause its complete destruction. The leather be- comes dry, reddish brown, porous, and tends to peel or powder. The leather is easily scratched, corners wear easily, and cracks appear. Smith reviewed the subject of pres- ervation of leather bookbindings from sulfuric acid deterioration. This is an excellent review of the literature, with an extensive list of references on all aspects of the subject. He summarized his findings thus [33, p. 55]: 1. Sulfuric acid is a prime cause of leather bookbinding deterioration. 2. Sulfuric acid is introduced into leather directly during certain steps of the tanning process and indirectly by adsorption and oxi- dation of sulfur dioxide from the atmosphere. 3. The chemical mechanism of deterioration by sulfuric acid on leather is hydrolysis. 4. The critical point of leather deterioration by sulfuric acid is approximately a pH of 3. 5. The addition of grease does not protect leather from deterioration by sulfuric acid. 6. Leather bookbindings can be protected to a limited degree by addition of certain salts. 7. Ideal protection for leather bookbindings would consist of isolating leather bookbindings from contamination by sulfunrc acid and re- quiring storage in air-conditioned areas. Temperature and humidity.-There appears to be a close relationship be- tween the chemical and physical deteri- oration caused in paper by light, heat, and moisture. All three environmental factors occur simultaneously to some extent in library stacks, storage, and reading areas and are grouped together as "aging." The concepts of stability,
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 61 permanence, and durability of paper are often grouped under the term "aging." Wilson and Hebert [54] dis- cussed this matter succinctly in a recent paper. They stated that permanence is basically a function of the chemical sta- bility of paper. Durability on the other hand, they say, is primarily a function of the physical properties of the fibers and the way they are compounded to form a sheet of paper. A paper which is intended to receive rough treatment for a short lifetime must be durable but not necessarily permanent. There is obvi- ously a relationship between perma- nence and durability and the proper balance must be achieved. The phenomena which occur in pa- per as time passes and which are some- how involved in demonstrating durabil- ity and permanence can be classed to- gether as aging. Librarians are more interested in permanence than in dur- ability. Many properties of paper seem to be involved during the aging process and the determination of these proper- ties gives some idea of how papers measure up to expectations. Some of these measurements are reflectance (color and brightness); pH (acidity); folding endurance (brittleness); tear, burst, and tensile (strength) measure- ments. The commonest measures of permanence are folding endurance and pH. It is not my intention to explore prop- erty analysis methods but only to men- tion them briefly, as terms which will be used from time to time in discussing de- terioration. It is appropriate to mention in passing that Hebert, Tryon, and Wil- son [71] have added a new method- differential thermal analysis-to those available for investigators and find it appears to be promising as a technique for evaluating stability. There appears to be high correlation with pH values. In another study, however, Wilson and Hebert [54] did not find high correla- tion between pH and the rate of dete- rioration of physical properties of pa- per. High temperature exposures of pa- per, even for short periods, cause yel- lowing and brittleness. Moderate heat over long periods has a slow aging effect on paper. Low temperatures are regard- ed as preservative to paper. A combina- tion of moderate to high temperature and low humidity will cause paper to dry out and become brittle. The mois- ture content which is in equilibrium with 30 percent RH represents about as low as is -safe for paper; if humidity is held above 75 percent RH for long periods mildewing will occur. General- ly, it is recommended that temperature be about 70?-80? F and relative hu- midity 45-55 percent for effective pres- ervation of paper [16, 72]. James Gear (personal communication, May 1969) at the National Archives states that they maintain temperature at 74? + 40 F and relative humidity at 50 per- cent ? 4 percent. Werner [73] recommends for archi- val materials-chiefly paper and parch- ment-that the atmospheric humidity should be controlled between 50-60 per- cent relative humidity at a temperature of 60'-75' F. As will be recalled from an earlier part of the discussion, the new National Agricultural Library at Beltsville, Maryland was built to speci- fications equivalent to 50-60 percent RH, in the temperature range of 74?- 78? F. At the same time, Werner gives 68 percent RH as the critical value, above which mildew and mold growth will occur. Plenderleith [25] also states that 68 percent RH is the absolute dan- ger limit in the temperature range of 60?-75? F. In actual practice, he states that 65 percent RH is preferable as the
62 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY permissible upper limit of relative hu- midity to guard against mildew. In view of the importance of "object humidity" as discussed elsewhere in this paper, a permissible value of 68 percent appears to be a bit high. Fur- ther, the recommendation of permitting ambient humidities as high as 60 per- cent RH seems to be skirting the danger zone; somewhat lower relative humid- ity values, perhaps 45-55 percent, ap- pear to be safer for library materials. Launer and Wilson [74] found that a temperature of 1000 C for three days will cause extensive damage to paper. Mild heating will cause yellowing of pa- per made from new-rag, refined sulfite, old-rag soda-sulfite, and newsprint pulps, especially those bleached by light. They found that the yellow color caused by heating could be bleached out by light and the bleaching caused by light could be nullified by heating, depending upon which process predomi- nated. The effects of heat on paper vary greatly depending upon the quality of the paper and the nature of the various constituents used as fillers. Shaw and O'Leary [75] found that rag papers characterized as good book paper were not appreciably affected in heat tests. Purified wood pulp also produced a fairly stable paper. Paper made from a mixture of sulfite and soda pulp was less stable than those made from the purer fibers. There was a close relation- ship between the purity of the cellulosic fibers used and the stability of unsized papers made from them, but only a small amount of alum and no rosin size was used. In other tests, the acidity of the paper has had a great bearing on ability to withstand heat. In his review on paper permanence associated with acidity and storage con- ditions, Smith [45] makes several good points with respect to the effects of heat. He points out that a good deal of our past history shows deplorable lack of interest in the effects of high heat on books and paper. Several cases of ex- tremely high storage temperatures are cited which must have resulted in great- ly abbreviating the useful life of the books. Smith observed that we should not be surprised that many of our books are useless, but rather that the majority of books in libraries can still be used. And it is probably true that today many libraries and book storage areas still have excessively high temperature con- ditions, especially in the summer. Tem- peratures of 135?-140? F are normal in the summertime in warehouses and box- cars. Values taken from Barrow [59] are of interest in that they show the effect of temperature on a paper's rate of de- terioration. Folding endurance was measured on new book paper after heat- aging at 1200 C, 1000 C, 800 C, and 600 C and the data plotted as regression lines for each temperature. The values obtained in the Barrow study indicated that it takes 7.5 times longer to reduce this paper's folding endurance to a given value for each drop of 200 C in temperature. The times required to re- duce the paper from 219 folds to sixty- five folds by heating at temperatures from 120? C to 60? C, and by extrapo- lation, the times required to produce the same result at temperatures below 600 C are shown in table 16. Smith [45] adapts the data of Brown- ing and Wink [76], using calculations with the Arrhenius equation8 to develop sThe logarithmic form of the Arrhenius equation is as follows: k2 Ea T2-T1 logio-= - * ki 2.303R T2. T, where logio k,/kl is the ratio of the rates of re- action k2 at the higher temperature (60? C) and
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 63 a table showing the effect of storage temperature on paper impermanence. This approach utilizes the concept of paper half-life, an idea similar to the concept of half-life in the decay of ra- dioactive elements. Thus, for example, a paper with an original fold value of 100 folds would, after expenditure of its half-life, have a fold value of 50, after the second half-life a fold value of 25, and so on. The ideal, high quality pa- per, is defined as one with a folding en- durance half-life of one year when stored at 60? C (1400 F). The values obtained are shown in table 17. The ac- curacy of the prediction increases at the higher temperatures or as the tempera- ture of the experiment is approached. The low temperature predictions would be low because the reaction rates caused by water would be reduced.

Luner [53], in a recent article on pa- per permanence, also discusses the Browning and Wink application of the Arrhenius equation for developing values for predicting paper aging. He points out that there are a number of difficulties inherent in the use of the Arrhenius equation which are not read- ily apparent. Further, the characteris- tics of the various papers have a strong influence on the results. More informa- tion is needed on the chemical and physical reactions which contribute to TABLE 17 EFFECT OF STORAGE TEMPERATURE ON PAPER IMPERMANENCE AVERAGE STORAGE AVERAGE STORAGE TEMPERATURE TEMPERATURR PAPER Diff.

Nonethe- less, the equation appears to be a very useful tool in studies of paper perma- nence properties in libraries. Smith brings together the effects of both temperature and acidity on paper permanence, using considerations simi- lar to those he used with reference to storage temperature. For this purpose, he defined a paper as having a half-life of 100 years at a pH of 6.0 and a tem- perature of 68? F (200 C). He then varied the pH and temperature to ob- k1 at the lower temperature (20Q C); E. is the en- ergy of activation estimated at 30,000 calories per mole; R is the gas constant, 1.986 calories at 1 C per mole; Ts is the higher temperature and To is the lower temperature in degrees Kelvin.
64 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY tain values of half-life. The effect of pH change on half-life was estimated at 53.2 percent and 10.0 percent half-life retention for an increase in acidity of 1 hot and 1 cold water extraction pH unit, respectively. The effect of temper- ature change on half-life was estimated as he did in the previous example.

Smith discusses the situation with its several variables in details which should be sought in the original article. In any case, the method of prediction indicates that both pH and storage temperature have had strong influences in producing the de- teriorated condition of books in many libraries. Smith [45] rates humidity, or rather the water contained in paper, as the third most important factor in paper deterioration in libraries, after pH and storage temperature. While excessive dryness will cause paper to become brit- tle and excessive wetness is conducive to mildew or fungal growth, apparently the role of moisture is not that easily dismissed. Some water in paper, as in many materials, is in a bound form- not easily freed to enter into or catalyze chemical reactions as free water. Water in paper in equilibrium with 50 percent RH has been reported by Browning and Wink [76] to hasten the rate of deterioration during accelerated aging by ten times that of a bone-dry paper. Smith cautions that our usual pres- ent-day recommendations of a relative humidity of 50 percent for storage and for library stack and reading room values may emphasize current physical properties of a paper at the expense of its future properties. However, it is very difficult to recommend the opti- mum value when sufficient definitive in- formation is unavailable today, particu- larly for values below 50 percent RH. He suggests that paper permanence should improve with reduction of rela- tive humidity but also admits that costs for achieving low relative humidities with air-conditioning systems are high. The effect of relative humidity and temperature on paper is discussed at some length by Wink [77], who shows that properties such as folding endur- ance are extremely dependent upon hu- midity control. Mason [78], in discuss- ing the effects of low humidity climates on brittleness in paper, suggests that water should be added to the atmo- sphere since for every 10 percent rise in relative humidity, the folding strength of paper doubles. Obviously, this curve levels off fairly rapidly. In making rec- ommendations for rare book collections, Mason [78] suggests a separate air-con- ditioning machine-a system capable of
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 65 maintaining a constant temperature of 700 F (or lower if personnel can stand it) and 50 percent relative humidity. This would introduce costs, however, which many libraries might not be able to afford. Storm [79], making recom- mendations for preservring rare book collections, stipulates 683-750 F and 45-50 percent RH. Storm states, how- ever, that 650 F would be better for books of all ages and kinds, but is a little chilly for people. Noblecourt [80] suggests the follow- ing relative humidities for storage of li- brary materials at temperatures of 600- 750 F: 45 to 63 percent RH for news- papers, leather, buckram, printed books, maps, music, manuscripts, parch- ment, engravings, prints, and drawings; and 50 to 63 percent RH for postage stamps, adhesive labels, and acetate and celluloid base photographic films. Raistrick [81 ] emphasized the effects of heat and moisture on leather, stating that a common cause of deterioration is the combined action of these factors. Such damage is manifested in loss of strength and hardening of the leather. Storage at temperatures about 400 C (1040 F) and 100 percent RH results in a considerable loss of strength in most types of leather. Increased stiff- ness and cracking, loss in area, and fall in shrinkage temperature are also re- ported. In tests Raistrick performed, all leathers tested lost about 50 percent strength after five weeks at 600 C (1400 F) and 100 percent RH. Light.-Recalling the admonitions of the many people who have written on the subject of materials deterioration by light, Stolow [82, p. 302] summed up the matter succinctly for museum curators as follows: The deteriorating effects of light on museum collections depend on the intensity of the radi- ation; the time of exposure; the spectral char- acteristics of the radiation; and the intrinsic capacity of individual materials to absorb and be affected by the radiant energy. External factors also influence the rate of deterioration -humidity, temperature, and active gases in the atmosphere. We know we cannot consider light as a single danger; high temperature, high humidity, and the presence of oxygen usually speed up the process of deterioration. Essen- tially, we must take into consideration: the characteristics of the radiation, the matenrals exposed, and the condition of their exposure. Until laboratory tests prove to the contrary, any museum curator must assume that the ex- tent of photochemical damage will be reduced in direct proportion to the reduction of the intensity of illumination or the time of expo- sure-no matter what the light source. He must also remember the important factor of temper- ature: for with a ten-degree rise in temperature the rate of chemical change can double. De- priving an object of oxygen . . . can also serve to minimize photochemical change in that oxy- gen is often necessary to propagate intermedi- ate steps in photochemical reactions. Although, if anything, the photo- chemical deterioration problems of the museum curator are more severe than those of the librarian, Stolow's remarks also hit close to home for library col- lections. Practically speaking, librarians usually cannot provide the special envi- ronments for their collections that cura- tors can for unusual objects. But for rare library items, the situations are much the same for the two types of in- stitutions. Although the deteriorating effect of light is not considered so seri- ous for library materials as is that of such factors as pH, temperature, and humidity, it warrants attention and has been known to assume serious dimen- sions under some circumstances. The effects of light and the need for adequate lighting in libraries, archival depositories, and museum collections have been reported on and reviewed a great many times. Several of the refer- ences available to the reader are pro- vided at the end of this paper [16, 26, 47-48, 72, 74, 82-96]. Of the various
66 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY materials found in libraries in large quantities, paper represents the mate- rial most affected by light. Other library materials subject to deterioration by light [16] include textile (cotton) bind- ing materials, binding cords and thread, parchment, and various types of plas- tics, rubbers, and adhesives, inks [97] and many dyes [87, 89]. The effect of sunlight on inks was in- vestigated by Barrow [97]. He found, for example, that the iron-gall inks of the colonial period in America, have either remained black, turned rusty brown, or faded out completely. His tests indicated that sunlight decom- poses the tannic acid in the ink, causing the writing to turn brown or fade. The basic material in paper which undergoes degradation is the polymer, cellulose, the structure of which is shown in figure 2. Cellulose itself does not absorb visible radiation. Thus one might expect that it would not be de- graded by wavelengths longer than about 400 millimicrons. But several in- vestigators have shown it to be affected by wavelengths as high as 460 millimi- crons. Feller [91] suggested that per- haps some components of paper other than cellulose-glue, rosin, or other constituents-absorb the visible violet and blue and sensitize the paper to deterioration. Although the exact mode of action of sunlight on cellulose is not completely known, there appear to be roles played in addition to that of light, by oxygen or ozone, by moisture, and possibly by other reactants. The cellulose structure is considered to be made up of glucose residues united by linkages known as 1,4-glycosidic linkages of the beta type. All the potential reducing groups, ex- cept that on one terminating unit in each chain, are involved in these glyco- sidic linkages. Each glucose unit, except those terminating chains, has one pri- mary and two secondary hydroxyl groups. The main reactions of the mole- cule are those of the hydroxyls and of the glycosidic linkages. Any oxidation of the cellulose molecule by atmospher- ic oxygen will be a complex reaction with several possibilities. For exanple, the primary hydroxyls may be oxidized to aldehydes, which may be further oxi- dized to carboxyls; the secondary hy- droxyls may be oxidized to ketones; oxidative action may cause opening of the ring with aldehyde groups formed; glycosidic linkages may be attacked; and secondary valency forces between individual chains may be broken [98]. The action of ultraviolet light upon cellulose leads to the formation of oxy- cellulose.

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 67 (see the section on pollution, above). The reaction is accelerated by water vapor, and is preceded by absorption of ultraviolet light [98, 99]. Tests used for detecting the degrada- tion of paper by light include measure- ment of copper number, of the amount of alpha-cellulose, of the viscosity in cuprammonium solution, of the folding endurance, and of the bursting and ten- sile strengths. Folding endurance is a measurement of brittleness. Bursting and tensile strength tests measure over- all paper strength. The alpha-cellulose measurement, which determines the amount of cellulose insoluble in a solu- tion of 17.5 percent sodium hydroxide, is a measure of the amount of reducing materials present. A high copper num- ber is a measure of either low grade pa- per or deteriorated paper. Cuprammo- nium viscosity is a measure of degrada- tion, a low viscosity indicating broken cellulosic chains. Carboxyl groups (-COOH) may be measured by titration, by liberation of carbon dioxide, and other methods. An increase in carboxyl content may indi- cate oxidation of aldehyde groups or primary hydroxyls, but differentiation between the two is difficult. For further discussion of measurement of carboxyl and aldehyde groups the reader is re- ferred to investigations of Wilson and co-workers [100, 101]. It is fairly well agreed that the sun- light resistance of paper in general de- pends to a large extent on the composi- tion of the paper and on the kind of cellulosic material present. Yet, all pa- pers are susceptible to damage by sun- light. Launer and Wilson [74] found that photochemical stability of papers is related to the kind and source of ma- terials used in manufacture and they rated different papers in the following decreasing order of resistance: new rag, refined sulfite, old rag, soda-sulfite, and newsprint. The presence of rosin, glue, alum, iron, lignin, or other substances, whether included accidentally or pur- posely, has a strong bearing on degra- dation of paper by light. Although there is no question that unfiltered sunlight is a strong degrader of almost all organic materials, and all kinds of paper are certainly included in that category, the problem of light de- terioration of paper of most concern to librarians, archivists, and museum cur- ators is not that caused by unfiltered sunlight. Rather, it is that caused by the light which enters the building through windows or skylights, and the artificial light used for illuminating the premises. Studies of the degradation of cellu- lose products by radiation have shown that the greatest damage is caused by ultraviolet energy of wavelengths short- er than 360 millimicrons. However, damage is still appreciable for wave- lengths up to 500 millimicrons. This in- cludes all the violet and blue part of the visible spectrum [16, 102]. Launer and Wilson [74], however, demonstrated that the light usually affecting papers is in the range of 330-440 millimicrons. They pointed out that direct sunlight, light from the quartz-mercury arc, and from the unfiltered carbon arc all fail to represent the kind of light to which record papers are normally subjected in libraries and archives. They noted that exposure in these places is limited to in- direct sunlight transmitted by window glass, or to that from the tungsten in- candescent lamp. Launer and Wilson [74] used a light source for a series of tests filtered to eliminate all infrared, as well as the ul- traviolet shorter than 330 millimicrons. Thus they had a light source with wave- lengths of approximately 330-750 milli-
68 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY microns with a strong band at 389 mil- limicrons. In these tests, they showed that discoloration of paper is a com- bined effect of light and heat. The yel- lowing of delignified paper, commonly ascribed to light, is due to heat or age. When heat effects were eliminated dur- ing irradiation by control of tempera- ture of the experiment, the papers actu- ally bleached, and even lignified paper bleached when irradiated in an oxygen- free nitrogen atmosphere. The two ap- parently opposite effects-bleaching TABLE 19 PROBABLE RELATIVE DAMAGE Wavelength Probable Relative (Mp) Damage 300 775 320 450 340 263 360 145 380 107 540 1.2 Sourcz.-Adapted from Judd [861 (Judd's values X 100). and yellowing-may occur simultane- ously. If a white paper turns yellow when irradiated, reactions other than photochemical ones may be involved. Papers containing lignin will, however, yellow in air or oxygen even in the ab- sence of heat effects. Paper scorched brown at high temperatures, or yellowed at 1000 C, as well as a 250-year-old yel- lowed paper, all were bleached by light. Launer and Wilson [74] also showed that water vapor accelerates the effect of light on paper made of cotton cellu- lose, but has the reverse effect on paper made from wood pulp. Free rosin and sulfuric acid increase the effect of light on cotton, rag, and purified woodpulp papers much more than on inferior pa- pers. Work done by the National Bureau of Standards in connection with the preservation of the Declaration of In- dependence and the U.S. Constitution shows the connection between the wave- lengths of light and damage to paper and parchment exposed to this light. Reference is made to table 13 previous- ly shown. The National Bureau of Standards also did studies to extend the range shown in table 13 to 300 millimicrons. Some of these values are adapted from Judd [86] and shown in table 19. Here we can see how rapidly relative damage increases as we get deeper into the shorter wavelengths. Judd [86, p. 4] makes the statement: The probable rate of damage from radiation continues to rise with decreasing waveIengths below 300 millimicrons; but this is of no inter- est in museum lighting because none of the light sources available emits appreciably at wavelengths below the band, 290 to 310 milli- microns, characterized by the value of prob- able rate of damage at 300 millimicrons. Sitni- larly, the probable rate of damage from radi- ation continues to fall with increasing wave- length above 640 millimicrons and is known not to reach zero short of 1100 millimicrons (note that the infrared can be photographed to about this wavelength), but these small probable rates of damage to the average museum object are negligible compared to those associated with the shorter-wave energy emitted by all light sources suitable for museums. What Judd says about museum light sources and damage can generally be considered to hold true for libraries. Judd's study [86] of the radiation hazard of museum light sources con- tains valuable information for librarians seeking advice on the protection of their collections from light. Harrison's report on the deteriorating effects of modern light sources [87] should also be con- sulted for valuable information. Our re- view does not permit us to include many of the details in these two reports but some indicative material should be men- tioned. It should be recognized, of course, that the museum curator's light- ing problem is somewhat different from
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 69 that of the librarian. Museum objects of historical or artistic value vary greatly in their material nature. Also there is al- ways a problem of exhibiting these ob- jects to the best artistic advantage to permit the viewer to see them as the original artist intended. Many of these objects already have suffered consider- able deterioration. Many more of the objects in museums and art galleries must be displayed to the best color ad- vantages, as for example paintings. Judd brings out clearly the dilemma of the museum curator [86, p. 4]: From the estimate of probable relative rate of damage of museum objects from radiation4 it may be seen that every light source giving good color rendition (radiant emittance well distributed throughout the visible range, 380 to 760 millimicrons) is necessarily associated with appreciable radiation hazard. . .. The directors of museums have therefore to make a difficult choice for each museum object. Either they can display the treasure by a light source yield- ing a good approximation to the color rendition of natural daylight, thereby eventually destroy- ing it by photochemical decomposition; or they can seal the treasure in a vault screened from all radiation and filled with an inert gas, thereby preserving it indefinitely but also preventing anybody from ever seeing it; or they can adopt some compromise between these two. By comparison, the librarian's prob- lems of illumination are simpler. He wishes chiefly to provide suitable light by which clients may read or study, al- beit often for extended time periods, without doing damage either to his cli- ents' eyes or to the items in his collec- tions. Studies of damage by radiation to museum collections are quite applicable to library problems. For example, White [88], in discussing library lighting standards, brings out the fact that rec- ommendations for illumination in li- braries has increased considerably over the period of 1931-56. Table 20 shows the recommended values. White also points out that some libraries (Kent State Library and Davenport Public Li- brary) have already gone to levels of 70-100 footcandles in reading rooms. Blackwell [93] reports on the lighting requirements for sample library tasks. His data ranges from 0.9 footcandle re- quired for very easily read print to 141.0 footcandles for reading difficult spirit-duplicated samples. Some of his recommended lighting standards for li- braries range considerably higher than those reported on by White. Judd's report on museum lighting [86] provides interesting data both from the standpoint of relative damag- ing effects per footcandle for a large number of different light sources and for consideration against the increasing levels of illumination being recommend- TABLE 20 RECOMMENDED MINIMUM ILLUMINATION VALUES IN FOOTCANDLES 1931 1932 1937 1938 1941 1947 1949 1952 1956 Reading rooms .......... 10 7.5-10 20 30 30 25 20 30-50 30-50 Workrooms ................... 7.5-10 30 20 30 25 20 30 30 Periodical room . . ........ ...... 7.5-10 20 .. .... ......25 20 ......

He reported on six light sources-an incandescent lamp of color temperature 2,8540 K; a daylight fluo- rescent lamp of 8,0000 K; a warm- white deluxe fluorescent of 2,9000 K; a cool-white deluxe fluorescent of 4,3000 K; natural sunlight with sun at 30? al- titude and air mass of 2 with 5,3000 K; and the zenith sky equivalent to 1 1,000? K." He made combinations of these sources with no filter and with four dif- ferent filters, including window glass, to give a total of thirty combinations. His figures were calculated and expressed as the probable rate of damage per foot- candle. Judd [86, p. 7] states: "It is be- lieved that these computed results indi- cate reliably the relative rates of photo- chemical decomposition of cellulose by these light sources. Furthermore, these computed results are the best estimates of radiation hazard for museum objects generally that we can make from pres- ently available information.

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 71 mates are submitted as guides in the se- lection of light sources for museums." I do not wish to draw any quantita- tive conclusions by combining White's and Judd's reports; rather I wish sim- ply to draw attention to the manner in which increasing values of illumination bring with them increasing probabilities of deterioration. IV. ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS Because we know the effects of im- proper environmental conditions on the materials in library collections, we are in a position to reduce deterioration by adjusting conditions to desirable levels. The adjustment of temperature and hu- midity, the removal of particulate mat- ter such as dust and dirt, and the elimi- nation of damaging air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and ozone are properly the responsibility of the air-conditioning expert. Adjusting these factors to optimum levels for per- manence of library materials helps to insure that the present library collec- tions will remain useful into the far future. Although air-conditioning will not repair the damage of past deteriora- tion, it will appreciably reduce any fur- ther damage. Restoration experts can apply their talents to returning the ma- terials to a useful condition in many cases. It is the responsibility, not of the air- conditioning expert, but rather of li- brary materials research people, to in- form the air-conditioning engineers of the environmental conditions required to keep books in the physical-chemical states most conducive to long life. As will be evident from earlier discussions in this paper, we have fairly good knowledge of temperature and humidity requirements. We know that dust and dirt should be held to a minimum. But we do not yet have definitive knowl- edge of criteria for gaseous air pollu- tants. It is quite important that we de- velop such knowledge, because the cri- teria that must be met determine the cost of providing the service. With costs rising so rapidly today, many library budgets cannot stand extravagant air- conditioning costs and the end result could be a return to improper environ- mental conditions. Although this discussion pertains mostly to long life for books, the air- conditioning problem reaches into the human comfort area. Fortunately, the most desirable ranges for both consid- erations coincide approximately. If any- thing, the most desirable temperature conditions for books are somewhat low- er than for people. It appears that Americans make more of this problem than do Europeans. Europeans appear more willing to dress warmer to be able to utilize libraries at lower tempera- tures than Americans do. The subject of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning libraries is dis- cussed for the layman in Metcalf's book [83] on planning library build- ings. It provides a fine discourse on the general aspects of the subject, chiefly from the standpoint of patron and staff comfort. Some hints on collection pres- ervation are included, however, such as the importance of humidity regulation when moisture conditions are low. For example, in areas where outside temper- atures may be very low, perhaps -20? or 30? F, heating of the same air in- doors to 70? F will lower relative hu- midity to perhaps 10 percent. While people may adjust to these undesirable conditions, albeit with discomfort, books, papers, and old leather bindings will deteriorate. Among numerous other aspects, Metcalf also discusses the problems associated with addition of moisture to library atmospheres, and
72 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY the filtering of air to remove particulate matter. He provides a summary of at least five alternatives the librarian is faced with in deciding upon what type of environmental control his library should have. These are shown in table 22. The technical aspects of air-condi- tioning are discussed in a number of re- cent works. Among these are Merritt's TABLE 22 ALTERNATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS a) Heating only, not recommended for most libraries b) Minimum recommended installation: heat- ing and ventilating with air filtration c) Comfort installation: heating, ventilation, air filtration, and cooling. This is recom- mended if the library is open to the public during long hot and humid periods d) Conditioned installation: heating, ventila- tion, air filtration, cooling and humidity control. This is recommended for situations noted in [3] if the collections have rare and irreplaceable books and manuscripts e) The ideal installation: heating, ventilation, air filtration, cooling and humidity control, all within certain specified narrow limits in order to maintain ideal conditions of tem- perature and humidity the year around, re- gardless of outside conditions Souacz.-Metcalf 183, p. 1981. Building Construction Handbook [103] and the guide and data books of the American Society of Heating, Refriger- ating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers [11, 12, 104]. The latter provide both theoretical discussions of all phases in- volved in the field, as well as practical applications. The general subject of public buildings, specifically libraries and museums, is discussed in detail. Any librarian seriously interested in in- troducing air-conditioning into his pres- ent facilities, or responsible for assist- ing in the design of new air-conditioned facilities, would do well to familiarize himself with these guide and data books. The composition of air, the nu- merous pollutants or contaminants which can be expected, the relation- ships of temperature and humidity, de- sign of systems, criteria for environ- mental factors, and some discussion of the effects of the various environmental factors on library and museum mate- rials are included. Earlier in this paper, the statement was made that the environmental prob- lems of libraries and museums are rea- sonably parallel. The literature indi- cates, however, that museum curators and research people have devoted them- selves more deeply to studying the de- tails of environmental control by means of air-conditioning systems. I was some- what disappointed to find relatively few discussions or reviews particularly di- rected to air-conditioning of libraries. A similar statement can be made regard- ing the scarcity of criteria and specifi- cations on temperature, humidity, par- ticulate matter, aerosol air pollutants, gaseous air pollutants which developed in discussions with librarians, govern- ment officials and government engineers responsible for public buildings. There appears to be a general opinion among these people, however, that such speci- fications are badly needed, but suitable criteria upon which to base them have not yet been stated clearly. Library ma- terials research groups should make a renewed effort to develop the informa- tion upon which such clear criteria could be based. Some of the results obtained in the studies made by museum research peo- ple are applicable to library situations and are recommended for study by li- brarians [14, 15, 105-110]. Some of the references found pertain specifically to libraries [12, 78, 104, 111] and some to document preservation [112, 113]. In order to control the growth of fungi by adjusting environmental con- ditions, most authorities feel it is neces-
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 73 sary to maintain relative humidity be- low 70 percent. The specifications for the proper conditions of relative humid- ity necessary to prevent the growth and reproduction of fungi vary consider- ably. It is probably safe to say that a constant relative humidity of 60-65 percent or lower will control the organ- isms. However, if any considerable vari- ations of temperature occur, so that lo- cal conditions of humidity rise above 70 percent, there will be danger of vegeta- tion and growth. After all, the humidity condition important in preserving li- brary materials is that at the surface of the paper or book where the fungal spores are. If the measured RH of the room is 60 or 65, but the RH at the sur- face rises to 80 or so due to a drop in temperature, the local condition would allow fungal growth. Thus, tempera- tures and humidities should be held fairly constant or within a narrow range which precludes sudden rises of RH or even condensation of water. Niuksha [32] states that optimum storage conditions for preventing fungal damage to books are 16?-200 C and 45- 60 percent RH. Beljakova [30] states that, for the Lenin State Library, tem- perature in the stack rooms is kept at 160-180 C, ?20 C (61?-64? F) and relative humidity at 50-60 -+7 5 percent. Generally speaking, relative humidities approximating 50 percent are sought to keep fungal damage to a minimum. Even this statement must, however, be oriented to other factors which bear on relative humidity requirements in li- braries-human comfort, cost, machin- ery available, temperature loads of the specific local climate, and many others. The recommendations of Noblecourt [80], cited in an earlier part of this pa- per, for relative humidity and tempera- ture values for the storage of various li- brary materials should be recalled. It is felt that Noblecourt considered not only the prevention of mildew but also other moisture requirements of the materials in question. The specifications for the new Na- tional Agricultural Library at Belts- ville, Maryland [114] call for dry-bulb temperatures of not over 78? F and not less than 740 F, with a wet-bulb tem- perature not over 650 F. These condi- tions would correspond to relative hu- midity conditions of about 50-60 per- cent. The ASHRAE Gude and Data Book [11, 12, 104] presents a fairly concise and definitive discussion of air-condi- tioning for libraries. Depending upon the type of library, the air-conditioning requirements, chiefly with regard to people, may amount to sixteen hours per day, or about 5,000 hours per year. However, the ambient temperature and relative humidity should not be subject to variation and should be maintained twenty-four hours per day. Stolow of the National Gallery of Canada, agrees with this wholeheartedly [110, p. 183] stating, "It is difficult to understand the logic of air-conditioning during the hours of public entry and turning it off when the museum is closed. The focus should be on the materials in the collec- tion and what happens to them in their environment. The particular relative humidity selected depends on climate, on human comfort, and on budget. But whatever the setting is to be, control at this level must be continuous. If control is not continuous, the resulting environ- ment can be worse than an utterly un- controlled one." The ASHRAE [104] recommenda- tions for design criteria are: A dry-bulb temperature of 70? 74? F and 40-50 percent RH. For rare book, document, and manuscript storage rooms, the rec- ommended temperature is 70?-72? F
74 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY and 45 percent RH the year around. The ASHRAE recommendations for dust and dirt suggest 85 percent effici- ency filters. For acidic fumes, ASHRAE suggests the use of water sprays at pH 8.5-9.0 incorporated into the condition- ing apparatus. However, alkaline water sprays are not always used. For exam- ple, although the U.S. National Ar- chives washes its air in water, the use of alkaline washes was stopped in 1941 (James Gear, personal communication). On the other hand, Robert M. Organ of the U.S. Museum of History and Tech- nology (personal communication, 1969) recommends alkaline wash water for acidic fumes, and filtering with oiled fiber glass filters for particulate matter. ASHRAE also recommends four to six air changes per hour in stack areas. Grad and Greenberg [111] in dis- cussing air-conditioning for books and people state that there is very little in- formation on criteria for air-condition- ing. Their recommendations of 760 F and 50 percent RH fall in the same range as most others. In the John M. Olin library of the Washington Univer- sity (Saint Louis), they state that tem- perature limits are 720 F in the winter and 780 in summer. They further state that to maintain 760 F during the sum- mer, an optimum for both people and books, would require an increase of 12 percent in refrigeration tonnage. Rela- tive humidity is controlled at 50 percent ? 5 percent and stack areas are air-con- ditioned twenty-four hours per day. According to Grad and Greenberg [111], one of the biggest problems is keeping books clean. Even in air-condi- tioned libraries, layers of dust due to inadequate filtering are found on books and other surfaces. Many other authors have commented on the same point. The particulate matter problem is made seri- ous by the dust and dirt brought into libraries by patrons and staff on shoes and other items. About 80 percent filter efficiency is adequate for cleanliness and economy. This may be improved, how- ever, by addition of 35 percent efficien- cy prefilters. One of the most effective methods of removing dust and dirt from the air is by electrostatic precipitators. The effi- ciency of these machines in removing aerosol particles is higher than all but the finest fabric filters [44]. However, the electrostatic precipitator character- istically produces ozone in sufficient amounts to be damaging to organic ma- terials and is thereby not recommended for removal of particulate matter in mu- seums and archival storage areas. These machines also produce some nitrogen oxides, which also deteriorate organic materials. The relative importance of heat, hu- midity, air pollutants, light, and biologi- cal agents will vary according to the person making the comparison. The cost of providing environmental control of these factors appears to be only par- tially documented in easily accessible sources. For example, I have found no specific discussions of the cost of pro- viding control of temperature, humid- ity, and gaseous pollutants in libraries. The ASHRAE guide and data books furnish helpful hints for calculating costs of providing temperature and hu- midity controls for buildings in general in terms of owning and operating costs for 1961 [12]. However, a very helpful discourse on the cost of furnishing clean air is provided by Bell [115]. Further- more, the evaluation of air cleaners is treated definitively by Whitby and his associates [116]. Bell states that the cost of air filtra- tion systems is usually second only to energy costs in mechanical air-condi- tioning system operating budgets of
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 75 commercial or industrial structures. It is assumed that Bell's study applies ap- proximately to providing the same type of air-cleaning service to libraries in the same types of urban areas. Without attempting to provide all de- tails of Bell's analysis of clean air costs, certain of his findings are presented to acquaint librarians with the more im- portant factors involved in insuring clean air in their libraries. For actual application to a specific case, reference should be made to the original article and the assistance of an expert ob- tained. Bell assumes a typical system which delivers 45,000 cubic feet per minute to the air-conditioning system in an office building in New York City. The effici- ency level of the filters is assumed to be in the 80-90 percent range, as deter- mined by a National Bureau of Stand- ards test. The cooling system provides 20 percent outside air in appropriate weather. The fan of the system operates approximately 4,400 hours per year. The so-called owning-operating cost analysis chart developed by Bell is pre- sented in table 23.

The single factor in any filter cost study that can have the greatest effect on final results is the filter life. Table 24 shows Bell's data for various filter types and combinations which apply to New York City, where dirt concentrations average 0.08 gr. per 1,000 cubic feet of air. Table 25 provides the multipliers for a number of other cities in the United States to convert the New York City values. There are additional factors which must be considered in cost analysis, such as proximity of air intake to ground level where the greatest amount of dirt is brought in, amount of outside air introduced, and use of more filtering than is required.

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 77 purchase and operation of a variety of air-filtering systems for providing clean air. Table 23 is self-explanatory in pro- viding the various factors and costs as- sociated with the attainment of the pa- rameters specified in the study. The cost of humidity control is not discussed specifically in the literature for libraries. Stolow of the National Gallery of Canada [110] makes some cogent remarks about museums which are applicable to some library situa- tions. For example, he states [110, p. 1841: The cost of humidity control depends on a number of variables. The most expensive is total control throughout a structure. If this expense is prohibitive, it is often feasible to supply controlled environment to a particularly sensitive area or even an object, and to provide lesser humidity control to the rest of the exhi- bition rooms. Local control can be arranged within glass cases or similar containers.... Relative humidity in a small room can be con- trolled by portable humidifiers of the spray type. To be fully effective, windows should be tightly sealed and doorways installed with auto- matically closing doors. Untreated water used in such portable humidifiers can result in a fine salt-like deposit forming over surfaces in the room. The use of demineralized water elimi- nates this objectionable dust. The small wick- type humidifiers with a three to five-gallon capacity are virtually useless in winter, unless a sufficient number are operated continuously to full capacity to achieve a relative humidity of 45 percent or more. Stolow also describes some of the vari- ous types of instruments which are used in making measurements of humidity, from the most simple to some of the more elaborate. He quotes approximate costs of these instruments which may be adjusted upward to account for high- er prices since 1966, but which enable the librarian to estimate costs when making needed measurements. One of the most important cases in which a highly controlled special envi- ronment was developed for documents of a highly revered nature, and which are irreplaceable, is that of the original copies of the Declaration of Independ- ence and of the Constitution of the United States. The sealed receptacle de- veloped for these documents (of animal parchment) is described im a report of TABLE 25 MULTIPLIER TO ADJUST MEDIA BASE LIFE VALUES FROM TABLE 23 TO OTHER LOCALITIES City Factor Atlanta, Ga. 1.6 Baltimore 1. 2 Boston 1.2 Charlotte, N.C. 1. 5 Chicago 1. 1 Cincinnati 1. 2 Dallas 1.6 Denver 1.3 Des Moines, Iowa 1.3 Detroit 1.0 Hartford, Conn. 1.6 Kansas City, Mo. 1.3 Los Angeles 1.0 Memphis, Tenn. 1.5 Miami, Fla. 2.0 Philadelphia, Pa. 1.0 Pittsburgh 1. 1 Saint Louis 1.2 San Francisco 2.0 Syracuse, N.Y. 1.3 Tulsa, Okla. 1.8 Washington, D.C. 1.7 SouitcE.-From Bell [115, p. 431 (American Air Filter Co., New York, by permission). the National Bureau of Standards [102]. In this specially designed case in the National Archives, the atmosphere provided is the inert gas, helium, with moisture added to maintain a relative humidity of 2 5-3 5 percent at room tem- perature (the temperature changes with the seasons of the year). Purity of the atmosphere was insured by use of high purity helium (less than 0.01 percent impurities) and flushing out the case until all air was removed. Protection against the damaging effects of radia- tion, chiefly light, is provided by the
78 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY use of filters which remove practically all damaging wavelengths, but permit adequate illumination for display pur- poses. The subject of climatology and con- servation is treated thoroughly by Plenderleith and Philippot [15]. Their discussions of hygrometry, or the mea- surement of the amount of moisture in the air, of the instruments for measur- ing atmospheric moisture, and of the various equipments for humidifying and dehumidifying the atmosphere, are especially recommended for any librar- ian wishing to become more knowledge- able in control of his collection environ- ment. Modern air-conditioning equip- ment, that is, for controlling tempera- ture and humidity, are discussed. The matter of cost of environmental control is discussed in terms of its importance in the overall budget of a museum, and the comparative costs of different ap- proaches. Helpful suggestions are made for consideration of numerous aspects of the environmental problem; some can eliminate need for extensive envi- ronmental control and some give very practical common-sense solutions to problems. Pollak [112, 113] discusses the sev- eral methods in common use for reduc- ing humidity as a method of preventing document deterioration. These vary from the simple method of reducing relative humidity by heating; to the ab- sorption of water vapor out of the air by using substances such as silica gel; to the use of the heat pump type of equipment. A common example of the heat pump is the refrigerator. This type of equipment operates by removal of water through condensation brought about by lowering the temperature of the air. The temperature of the newly dried air is then restored to the desired level, in some cases utilizing heat gen- erated in the process, and returned to the areas controlled. Although Pollak does not provide any specific costs in terms of dollars, he discusses the eco- nomics of the various dehumidification methods. Amdur [107] introduces a novel idea for humidity control in museums in his "isolated area plan." This plan appears to be most applicable to buildings in climates with very cold winters. Here one meets the problem of condensation and frosting on windows when an effort is made to keep relative humidity at a safe level for museum objects. The same observation would hold true for libraries, since the relative humidity re- quirements are similar. Amdur's idea is to prepare a building within a building and to utilize the intermediate air insu- lation layer to buffer the temperature differences between the outside and in- side. The subject of equipment and costs for removal of the gaseous air pollutants is not well documented. As mentioned earlier, ASHRAE does recommend an alkaline wash of the air at pH 8.5-9.0, but this recommendation is not always followed. Thomson [44] discusses re- moval of sulfur dioxide and oxidants briefly. He mentions that water washes alone can sometimes remove as much as 95-97 percent of the sulfur dioxide, but cautions against depending upon this efficiency. He quotes studies in which all sulfur dioxide is removed as pH values of 8.6 or better, but states that pH values of more than 9.0 could cause damage to metals. Some efforts to con- trol sulfur dioxide by absorbents are mentioned but not prominently. The removal of oxidant gases such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen per- oxide, and a variety of organic ozonides is also discussed briefly by Thomson [44]. Recommendations in this area are
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERMANENCE 79 quite vague. We must look to further research to develop methods for remov- ing these damaging pollutants from mu- seum and library atmospheres. Haagen- Smit [10] reports, however, that acti- vated charcoal filters will destroy ozone and plant-damaging peracylnitrates. As we know by the damage caused by ozone to unsaturated organic materials, ozone is strongly absorbed by such sub- stances. Thomson [44] asks why we should not develop cheap and effective ozone absorbers using such materials- a reasonable and logical question. Buck [108] also suggests activated charcoal for gaseous pollutants, including ozone. One of the few articles found report- ing on the effectiveness of air-condition- ing systems in removing acidic pollu- tants is that of Waller [14]. He pre- sents figures for removal of smoke, sul- fur dioxide, and acid droplets by the equipment at the National Gallery in London. Table 26 is adapted from Wal- ler and shows figures for sulfur dioxide and acid droplets. The removal of the acid components was quite incidental, according to Waller, and evidently was accomplished by the water in the hu- midifier tank. As will be noted, the sys- tem was effective in reducing sulfur di- oxide by about 96 percent. V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS There does not appear to be any question that library materials are sub- ject to serious deterioration now, have been subject ever since the first docu- ment was made, and probably will suf- fer deterioration to some extent as long as men record matters on materials as we know them. It appears to be a part of the nature of materials to revert to more stable states. These stable states of matter are usually not the most de- sirable states that man wants for re- cording history. The process of revert- ing to these more stable states is known as deterioration. Deterioration of materials can be brought about by a number of circum- stances. Two of these are the composi- tion of the materials and the environ- mental conditions under which these materials exist. It has been the objec- tive of this discussion to examine some of the environmental factors which cause deterioration of library materials.

The environmental factors are various forms of energy, all of which seem bent on changing materials into other mate- rials we do not want. Among the envi- ronmental factors examined have been those making up the atmosphere-both the normal constituents, including wa- ter, and the abnormal constituents, in- cluding pollutants; radiant energy and heat; and the deteriorative biological agents. Something of the nature of these environmental factors and the ef- fects they actually have on materials have been shown. Emphasis has been placed on ways librarians might reduce deterioration of materials in their col- lections by seeking environmental con- ditions conducive to long life and avoid-
80 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY ance of deleterious conditions. Finally, some of the criteria and specifications for environmental control available to librarians have been examined. Attention has been focused mainly on the more common materials in li- braries, chiefly paper and leather, with brief mention of a few other materials. This was necessitated more by the time limits of the article rather than by the lack of problems and information. Of necessity then, discussion was avoided of some of the more recently recognized environments such as forms of radiation which affect the storage of magnetic tapes-certainly a form of storage be- coming quite common and very impor- tant. Furthermore, it was necessary to omit discussion of the effects of the common environments on the many types of new materials such as photo- graphic and microfilms, magnetic tapes in general, plastics, rubbers, and adhe- sives. In conclusion, it is recommended that more attention be paid to library de- terioration problems. The criteria for safe usage, and short- and long-term storage of library materials could be in- vestigated in much greater depth and clarified considerably. The preparation of more acceptable specifications for li- brary environments safe for library ma- terials is sorely needed. These specifica- tions should cover not only temperature and humidity but all forms of pollu- tants-particulate matter of all kinds and the gaseous acidic and oxidizing pollutants as well. Finally, the specifi- cations should provide practical guid- ance for the librarian in choosing the proper illumination so that both his cli- ents and his collection will be adequate- ly protected.
