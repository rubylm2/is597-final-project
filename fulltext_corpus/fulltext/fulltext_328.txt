COLLEGE LITERARY SOCIETIES: THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, 1815-76 II. THE DECLINE OF COLLEGE SOCIETY LIBRARIES, 1841-76 THOMAS S. HARDING LIBRARIES OF NORTHERN COLLEGE LITERARY SOCIETIES, I84I-65 I N THE quarter-century between 1841 and 1865 the literary societies in the older northern colleges continued to flourish until the outbreak of the Civil War, although a few, like those at Am- herst, began to find some slackening of interest. However, as new colleges were started, literary societies were quickly established.' Libraries continued to play an impor- tant part in the life of the college socie- ties. In 1848 Charles C. Jewett, librarian of the Smithsonian Institution in Wash- ington, undertook a survey of library re- sources throughout the country. In northern colleges he identified 142 stu- dents' libraries with a total of 254,639 volumes, and 126 college libraries with 586,912 volumes.2 The larger number of students' libraries was undoubtedly due to the practice of having two or more society libraries in a single college. Jewett described the libraries as follows: College libraries, (exclusive of students' li- braries.)-Our colleges are mostly eleemosyn- ary institutions. Their libraries are frequently the chance aggregations of the gifts of charity; too many of them discarded, as well nigh worth- less, from the shelves of donors. This is not true of all our college libraries; for among them are some very important collections, chosen with care and competent learning, purchased with economy, and guarded with prudence,-though ever available to those who wish to use them aright. Students' libraries, in colleges, professional schools, academies, &c.-The societies formed by students in our seminaries of learning, for mutual improvement in debate and composition, for the most part possess libraries. These are generally useful collections of books of a popu- lar character. Sometimes (in Yale College par- ticularly) they are large, well selected, and ad- mirably arranged and kept. Dust seldom gathers on the books in such collections.3 In 1859 William Rhees's later com- pilation cited 196 college libraries of un- known size and 244 more with a total of 1,211,238 volumes; he also mentioned 259 students' libraries.4 Thus, while the decade of the 1850's showed an increase in the number and size of both college and students' libraries, the increase in college libraries was considerably greater. Although college libraries were out- 1 I. C.

COLLEGE LITERARY SOCIETIES 95 distancing those of the literary societies in size, they were still hedged about with regulations restricting their use. Daniel Coit Gilman, who had been elected presi- dent of the Linonian Society in 185 1,5 was appointed librarian of Yale Col- lege in 1858. He served in that position until 1865. Gilman strove to improve conditions in the college library. How- ever, his efforts to obtain adequate heat- ing facilities and to make longer hours possible through the employment of an assistant met with constant rebuff. Fi- nally, he resigned in discouragement.6 Dissatisfaction of Harvard students with their college library was reflected in a long letter to President Edward Everett written in 1848 by Walter Mitchell, an outstanding member of the class of 1846. Mitchell resented partic- ularly the policy of denying students di- rect access to the shelves.7 During the period around 1850, col- lege libraries were open only a few hours a week. Bowdoin was open one hour three times a week; Colby, one-half hour twice a week; Amherst and Trinity, once a week; Brown, four hours daily; Yale, five hours daily; Columbia, twice a week for two hours; and Hamilton, twice a week for one hour. Harvard had the most generous schedule: six hours Mon- day through Thursday and four hours on Friday.8 It should be remembered that in most cases the hours had to be such that they did not conflict with the classroom work of the faculty member who was the part-time custodian of the books.9 The Brown University Library Laws of 1843 provided that "no undergrad- uate, while receiving books, shall take down any book from the shelves without special permission from the librarian."10 At Yale in 1856 seniors and juniors only were allowed to draw or consult books. At Harvard in 1854 it was the rule that "no person, except the librarian and his assistants shall go into the alcoves of the general library, or take any book from the shelves therein, except under such special regulations as may hereafter be established."" Another Harvard regula- tion of 1854 provided that "the books most suitable for the use of undergrad- uates shall be separated from the rest, and kept in the librarian's room, where they shall be accessible to the students and may be borrowed by them."'2 The number of volumes permitted to be drawn from the library varied greatly. In 1850 at Amherst the professors were allowed an unlimited number; the stu- dents paid four or five cents a week for each book drawn. At Brown in 1843 the rule was that "no person except officers of instruction shall borrow more than one folio, which he may keep four weeks; or two octavos or two duodeci- mos, which he may keep two weeks."'-3 At Yale the Linonian Society Library doubled in size between 1837 and 1860, increasing from 5,581 to 11,300 vol- umes.14 On the other hand Brothers in rLinonian Society, "Records, XIII (Dec. 12, 1849-May 11, 1853)" (MS), December 17, 1851.

96 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY Unity had 11,652 volumes in its library in 1851,15 and 12,000 in 1854.16 Thus, in the perennial race between the two societies to build up their libraries, Brothers in Unity appeared to have the lead. The jealous concern of the two socie- ties for their libraries was reflected in an extract from the minutes of the faculty of Yale College, which appeared in the "Records" of Brothers in Unity in 1846: An informal discussion arose concerning the conditions on which rooms in the new Library Building are offered by the Corporation to the Literary Societies for the accomonodation (sic) of their libraries. It was stated that some appre- hension had been excited among the students by the impression, that if their libraries should once be deposited in this building, it would be out of their power ever afterwards to remove them from it. As it was thought desirable to ascertain the sense of the Faculty on this point, the gentlemen present were called upon individ- ually to state their views of it; and it was found to be their unanimous opinion, that the Socie- ties, by placing their libraries in the room tendered for their use by the Corporation, will incur no obligation to retain them there, but will be at liberty to withdraw them at any future time.'T In 1846 John Edmands was elected librarian of Brothers in Unity.'8 In this capacity he prepared a booklet of eight pages, indicating material of assistance to the members in writing or speaking, which was printed in January, 1847, under the title, Subjects for Debate with References to Authorities.'9 William Frederick Poole, who had become as- sistant to Edmands, succeeded him as librarian. Poole continued Edmands' practice of maintaining an index on slips of paper to material in books and maga- zines useful for current student exer- cises and debates. Perceiving the value of a more comprehensive index, Poole expanded the project to cover the entire contents of the periodical collection in the Brothers' Library,20 a project which later resulted in Poole's famous Alpha- betical Index to Subjects Treated in the Reviews and Other Periodicals, to Which No Indexes Have Been Pub- lished. LIBRARIES OF SOUTHERN COLLEGE LITERARY SOCIETIES, 184I-65 In the period after 1841 the literary societies of the older southern colleges continued to flourish until the outbreak of the Civil War. Furthermore, when new colleges were opened, such societies were quickly established. However, be- cause of the destruction caused by the Civil War and the general disruption of education during the Reconstruction Pe- riod after the war itself,'1 information concerning them is limited. Neverthe- less, comparative statistics, a few sur- viving library catalogs, and references to their libraries in the minutes of the societies themselves make possible at least a partial reconstruction of the pic- ture in southern colleges. In general, it may be said that college societies which 15 Society of Brothers in Unity, Yale College, Catalogue of the Library of the Society of Brothers in Unity, Yale College, July, 1851 (New Haven: Thomas J.

COLLEGE LITERARY SOCIETIES 97 had started their libraries before 1841 continued to build them up until the Civil War, while societies which came into existence between 1841 and 1860 undertook to establish libraries as one of their first projects. The survey by Rhees revealed that between 1851 and 1859 the number of southern college libraries increased by 121; of students' libraries, by 33. The number of volumes in 180 college libraries amounted to 435,969, an increase of 199,066; those in students' libraries were 94,109, an increase of 35,376. Thus both showed a healthy state of expansion. It should be noted that, while both college libraries and stu- dents' libraries in the South multiplied during the decade of the 1850's, the rate of growth for the college libraries was much greater. In recent years a study was made by Benjamin Edward Powell of the volumes in the society libraries of the universities of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia at twenty-year intervals. In Powell's study the general figures for states from Jewett and Rhees become explicit for individual universities. Here, again, the story is one of steady growth. The most spectacular was that of the University of North Carolina, where the libraries of the Dialectic and Philan- thropic societies doubled between 1840 and 1860 (7,000 and 14,000 volumes). Between 1840 and 1860 the number of volumes in the society libraries at the University of Alabama increased from 1,000 to 6,000; at the University of Georgia, from 3,000 to 5,350; at the University of South Carolina, from 1,000 to 2,200; and, at the University of Tennessee, from 200 to 3,000. At the University of Mississippi, which was founded in 1848, the society libraries had 1,500 volumes in 1860. Although several societies were formed at the Uni- versity of Virginia soon after its estab- lishment, any book collections they may have had were unimportant.2 As in the case of northern colleges, the southern college societies received their incentive in large measure from the un- satisfactory collections and restrictive regulations of the college libraries. The library of the University of South Caro- lina was open four hours daily; that of Centre College in Kentucky, two after- noons each month.23 At Maryville Col- lege in Tennessee the library was "opened whenever application was made for books."24 In 1858 at the University of Alabama it was ordained that "the books shall ordinarily be received at the door, without admitting the applicant into the library room." The students were forbidden to take down or displace any book and were "particularly re- quired to observe order and decorum, while receiving books from the librarian, under penalty of a fine not exceeding fifty cents, and such other punishment as the case may require.")25 At La Grange Female College in Geor- gia the women students proved to be worthy emulators of the males. The Hentz and Judson societies were formed early in 1853. One of their objectives was the promotion of reading by their members, and they were allowed Wednesday afternoons for this purpose. In their first year the two societies col- lected a library "of books from the most approved authors of ancient and modern times to the extent of nearly 1,000 vol- ' Benjamin Edward Powell, "The Development of Libraries in Southern State Universities to 1920" (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Graduate Library School, University of Chicago, 1946), p. 84. 3 Carlton, op. cit., p. 481. 24Ibid., p. 483. 25 Ibid., p. 484.
98 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY umes."Y26 Two years later this library had grown to nearly 2,000 volumes.2 By the academic year 1858-59 it comprised over 2,000 volumes, as well as a reading room, to which the students had access for literary improvement.28 Information about the libraries of Trinity College in North Carolina is more complete than for most southern college society libraries in the decade preceding the Civil War. The minutes of the Columbian Literary Society for 1848 recorded the election of E. A. Has- kins as librarian.29 By September, 1850, there were 32 books in the Society's li- brary, and a year later the number had risen to 59.30 When the Hesperian Society was or- ganized in 1851, the constitution re- quired the society to raise twenty-five dollars each session for a library. Presi- dent Braxton Craven agreed to raise a like amount during each session. In re- turn, the faculty were to have free ac- cess to the library and a member of the faculty was to be chairman of the com- mittee that appropriated the library funds. When the society had accumu- lated a library of 500 volumes, it was entitled to keep one student in the col- lege free of tuition.31 The constitution of the Columbian Literary Society provided that the li- brarian "shall keep a correct list of all the Books and documents belonging to the Columbian Library, and shall report the same to the Society at the close of each Presidential term. Furthermore, he shall be responsible to the Society, for all Books and other documents commit- ted to his care, by the Society."132 No member was allowed to draw from the library more than one book at a time or to retain a book longer than one presi- dential term.33 From their beginnings both the Co- lumbian and the Hesperian societies were very active in acquiring books.34 Both societies compiled manuscript cat- alogs of their libraries. In 1866 the Co- lumbian Literary Society had 2,270 vol- umes.35 Despite the disruption caused by the Civil War, the Hesperians had ac- quired 2,400 volumes by 1869.13 LIBRARIES OF WESTERN COLLEGE LIT- ERARY SOCIETIES, i84I-65 With the westward advance of the frontier after 1840 the concept of "West" needs to be reviewed. In this section Kentucky and Tennessee are no longer regarded primarily as western states, since their sectional alignment was now in the direction of the south. On the other hand, in addition to Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Mis- souri, the "West" will now be defined to 'La Grange Female College, Catalogue of the Faculty, Pupils, and Patrons of the La Grange Female College, at La Grange, Georgia, for the Scholastic Year Closing July 13th, 1853 (New York: John F.

COLLEGE LITERARY SOCIETIES 99 include Wisconsin and the trans-Missis- sippi states or territories of Iowa, Min- nesota, Kansas, California, and Oregon. Fifty-three western colleges estab- lished between 1841 and 1861 were still surviving in 1927-28. Of the 32 perma- nent colleges founded before 1815, only 4 were western. Of the 54 permanent colleges founded between 1815 and 1840, 23, or nearly one-half, were west- ern. Of the 96 permanent colleges estab- lished after 1840, those in the West exceeded the new colleges in both the North and the South.37 Almost without exception, the older literary societies of western colleges continued to expand their libraries, while the newer societies undertook to organize libraries as a primary objective. College library regulations in the west- ern states were similar to those of the North and South, with restrictions on student use. For example, at Kenyon College, Ohio University, and Ohio Wes- leyan University the library was open only one hour each week.38 At Oberlin students might withdraw books from the college library if they paid a special fee, but they were not en- couraged to do so. After the spring of 1837, students might draw two books at a time, but in the next year the librarian was granted the power to issue or with- hold books at his discretion. In 1843 the faculty voted further to guard the books by "so arranging the library that here- after students making applications for books shall be waited on at the door."89 At the University of Michigan one of the rules adopted by the university li- brary in 1841 provided that "no book shall be loaned to students except such as may have been distinctly specified by the faculty as suitable for such use," the reason being that "there are very few of the books in the library which would be useful to students during their collegiate course. " 40 In 1846 the librarian reported that twelve volumes of Greek and Latin translations had disappeared in spite of the fact that "by the regulatibns of the Library [they] are not permitted to be loaned to students. They have been taken from the Library without the knowledge of the Librarian, and though diligent search has been made for them, they cannot be found."'" The library regulations were revised in 1848, but they still stipulated that no books should be loaned to students, unless distinctly specified by the faculty.42 When Henry Philip Tappan was inaugurated as the University of Michigan's first president in 1852, he described the university li- brary as follows: When I first came to the University I found a Library of about four thousand five hundred volumes, stowed away in a small and incon- venient room. . . . It had been the custom for some member of the Faculty to hold the nomi- nal office of Librarian, while some student, under his direction, gave out books once or twice a week. About three hundred volumes were miss- ing. Scattered in various directions, two thirds of these were finally recovered. The Library, at this time, consisted mostly of miscellaneous English books; and was especially deficient in classical and scientific works, in American liter- ature, and in works of reference.43 7 Donald G.

100 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY In the face of such discouragements to library use, western college students were obliged to provide their own collec- tions in connection with their societies in order to obtain the material needed for their essays and debates. At Ohio Uni- versity the library of the Athenian Soci- ety amounted to about 1,500 volumes by 1856.44 During a three-year interval when Ohio University was forced to suspend its activities (1845-48), the Athenians placed their library in storage.45 The li- brary was renovated when the society resumed its activity, and in 1852 the of- fice of librarian was combined with that of treasurer.46 Apparently, this union of the two offices was neither satisfactory nor long-lasting, for in 1856 the Atheni- ans adopted a new by-law, regulating the library as follows: It shall be the duty of the Com. on the Li- brary to exercise a general supervision over the state of the Library (conflicting in no degree with the prerogatives of the Librarian); make such suggestions concerning it as they may deem proper; make the selections of books to be added to it for the purchase of which they shall have control of the funds appropriated by the Society to the Library.47 At Miami University the newly organ- ized Miami Society was operating on a fairly firm basis when suddenly it voted to unite with the older Union Literary Society (1842). The consolidated so- ciety took the name of Miami Union, which henceforth ranked with the Ero- delphian Society as the leading organi- zation on the Miami campus. The li- braries of the Miami and Union societies were also consolidated.48 In 1853 the Erodelphian and Miami Union literary societies took the un- usual step of making an agreement with the board of trustees of the university, whereby their libraries were to be turned over to the university library. In return, the two society halls were to be enlarged by removing the partitions between the halls proper and their library rooms. The trustees were only to hold the books "in trust" in that they were to be turned back to the societies upon their de- mand.49 Yet hardly had the libraries been turned over to the university when the societies began to worry about them. In 1854 the Erodelphians appointed a com- mittee to appraise the books in the hands of the trustees. This committee reported that the Erodelphians had 1,288 volumes on the university library record but that 50 were missing. In 1855 another com- mittee reported that 264 volumes were missing.50 Finally, the Erodelphians removed their books from the university library in 1857. The Miami Union seems to have retrieved its books about the same time. The Miami Union had made an inven- tory of its library in 1856, showing a total of 1,428 books on the record, with 281 missing.5' In view of the restrictions on the use of the college library, it is not surprising that the Oberlin societies set out to or- ganize their own libraries. The Union Society became active in book-collecting "Athenian Literary Society, Catalogue of the Regular and Honorary Members of the Athenian Literary Society, of the Ohio University, Athens, Ohio (Cincinnati: C.

COLLEGE LITERARY SOCIETIES 101 in the early fifties. In 1854 and 1855 the Phi Delta Society took the initiative in forming the College Literary Socie- ties' Library Association. In 1857 the library established by this organization, supported by the joint efforts of the Phi Delta and the Young Men's Lyceum, was made a depository for United States government documents. This library re- ported over 800 volumes in 1858 and 1,200 volumes in 1860.52 In 1859 the two ladies' societies re- solved to follow the example of the men's societies by forming the Ladies Society Library Association. The book com- mittee immediately proceeded to a local bookstore and bought Motley's Dutch Republic, Tennyson's works in two vol- umes, and Irving's Washington. Within two years the ladies had assembled be- tween three and four hundred volumes. Eventually, the College Societies' Li- brary Association and the Ladies Society Library Association were merged in the Union Library Association and their li- braries united.53 Meanwhile the Oberlin College Library grew slowly. In 1862 the number of books in the college li- brary was estimated at 6,000 and the number in the two literary society li- braries at 2,500. In 1863 these figures were raised to 6,500 and 4,000, respec- tively.54 Western college societies continued to look to their honorary members for help in the form of money and books for their libraries. In 1857 a committee of the Philopedian Society of St. Joseph's Col- lege at Somerset, Ohio, wrote Stephen A. Douglas, United States senator from Illinois, to inform him of his election as an honorary member. Included in the letter was the following description of their library: The object of the Philopedian Society is the improvement of its members by reading and debating in historical, philosophical, political and scientific knowledge. Our library, composed of standard works, is of much intrinsic value, though it cannot boast of a great number of volumes. It consists of upwards of six hundred volumes and is yearly being increased. This might seem to be suffi- ciently large for our purpose, but we find it ex- tremely difficult to obtain any reliable informa- tion concerning many parts of history; hence to avoid this difficulty we consider it our duty, and indeed make it one of our principal aims, to supply this defiency (sic). To say there is no other object which actuates us would hardly be true, for we look upon our library with pride, when we consider that with the money, which otherwise would have been spent foolishly- perhaps criminally--we have erected a worthy monument which will preserve our names "fresh" in our "Alma Mater.... . . Trusting that your desire for the advance- ment of the American youth in moral literature will secure this a favorable reception, we remain Your Most ob't sv'ts.55 The two societies at Wabash College (Calliopean and Lyceum) took great pride in the number and quality of the books obtained for their libraries. The librarian's duties were carefully defined in the by-laws. Non-members could bor- row a book only by formal vote of the society, although there were mutual con- cessions made to the members of the rival society.56 During 1856, 3,900 vol- umes from the library of the Calliopean Society were loaned to ninety readers.57 The Philalethean Society had been or- ganized at Hanover College in the '2 Fletcher, op. cit., pp. 763-64. 5 Ibid., p. 764. i Ibid., p. 742.

102 THE LIB3RARY QUARTERLY autumn of 1840. Within less than a year this society had accumulated a library of 1,316 volumes.58 The older Union Literary Society continued to build up its library, as the following entry in their minutes in 1859 indicated: "On motion Treasurer was instructed to procure Motley's History of the Dutch Republic of Prof. Sturgus, provided the price does not exceed his sons (sic) initiation fee."59 Newer colleges in Indiana followed the same pattern. At Moores Hill Col- lege the two societies-Philoneikean (men) and Sigournean (women)-com- menced building up their respective li- braries almost as soon as the college opened its doors in 1856.60 At Earlham College the Ionian Society (men) and the Phoenix Band (women) were both started in 1856. The library of each so- ciety was begun soon afterward by dona- tions of books from members.6' The Pythonian Society of North-Western Christian (later Butler) University accumulated a respectable library. College societies in Illinois were also eager to organize libraries soon after their founding. At Knox College both the Adelphi and the Gnothautii socie- ties established libraries and competed with each other in lecture courses.62 Dur- ing the first year of its existence, the Hinman Literary Society at North- western University acquired the private library of the late president of the uni- versity, Dr. Hinman, in whose honor the society was named.63 The constitution of this society provided that the librar- ian "shall have charge of the Library, keep an account of the no. & title of the books borrowed, the time when and by whom."64 No member could draw more than two books at one time or keep them for a longer period than two weeks.65 Members who were guilty of violating the rules laid down by the li- brarian could be fined for each offense not less than ten cents or more than twenty-five cents at the discretion of the society.66 Hardly had the Beltionian Literary Association been organized at Wheaton College, when in October, 1855, it voted to establish a library from the surplus funds of the society and to charge a fee of twenty-five cents per quarter for its use. By November the business com- mittee reported that twenty-five vol- umes had been purchased.67 The officers of the Alpha Nu Literary Society at the University of Michigan included a librarian and an assistant li- brarian. The former had charge of the society's library and opened it for the drawing of books at such times and in accordance with such regulations as the I Philalethean Society, "Records, I (Nov. 6, 1840 -Aug. 18, 1846)" (MS), September 27, 1841.

No member could draw more than two volumes at a time. He could not retain a book longer than four weeks without the consent of the society. Borrowing privileges were restricted to members of Alpha Nu. No member was allowed to keep a book during the "long vacation" without special permission of the society. All books were to be re- turned at the last meeting preceding the election of officers.69 If these regulations appear somewhat stringent, it should be noted that after 1856 students were not allowed to draw any books from the uni- versity library.70 At Albion College the Eclectic and Atheniaedes societies maintained li- braries. Their constitutions provided for a treasurer of the Library Fund as well as a librarian. The former collected all fines and initiation fees, received all donations to the Library Fund, and held all moneys in his posession, subject to the order of the board of directors of the joint societies. In addition to his other duties the librarian furnished the treas- urer of the Library Fund with a list of fines levied for overdue books. The li- brary committee purchased all books, as directed by each society, and assisted the librarian in his duties.71 It is almost certain that the rival societies at Albion, the Clever Fellows and the Clever Girls, maintained libraries also.72 At the University of Wisconsin the records of the Athenaean Society con- tained the following entry: "A Library was established Oct. 31, 1851 and John H. Lathrop Jr. elected Librarian. Since which time the Society has acquired a large number of valuable books."73 In the rival Hesperian Society the duties of the librarian were explicit: It shall be the duty of the Librarian to take charge of all books belonging to the Society; to lease the books to the members; to keep a record of the same, and to see that they are re- turned according to the Rules of the Library, and once in two weeks to report to the Treas- urer the names of the members who have in- curred Library fines, that they may be collected by that officer; and, also, at the last regular meeting in his term of office, to report the ad- ditions to the Library and the names of mem- bers who have incurred fines during his term of office.74 On the other hand, perhaps because of wartime conditions, the members of the Zetagathian Society at the State Uni- versity of Iowa appear to have made no effort to form a library for several years after their organization in 1861. The title of librarian was noticeably missing 'Alpha Nu Literary Society, Revised Constitu- tion and By-Laws of the Alpha Nu Literary So- ciety, with Catalogue of Books in the Society Library . . .

104 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY from their list of officers.75 Likewise, their by-laws contained no regulations for a library.76 In fact, it was not until over a year after the conclusion of hos- tilities that the Zetagathian minutes con- tained references to attempts to organize a library.77 When the Zetalatheon Society was formed at Brookville College late in 1864, the result of the Civil War was a foregone conclusion, and the society pro- ceeded without delay to establish a li- brary. A librarian was included in the list of officers.78 The Zetalatheons lost no time in getting their library started, since the minutes for their fourth meet- ing in December, 1864, contained the following entry: "The members were furnished with books from the library by the Librarian, after which the society adjourned."79 In his survey published in 1851 Jewett reported 32 college libraries in western states (Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illi- nois, and Missouri), as well as 30 stu- dents' libraries. The more complete sur- vey by Rhees in 1859 showed a much larger number of both college and stu- dents' libraries. Rhees located 137 col- lege and 56 students' libraries. The sta- tistics for 1859 include five states or territories (Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, California and Oregon) which had sent no returns to Jewett concerning their libraries. Even making allowance for the insufficient returns to Jewett's letter, the students' libraries were outstripped by the college libraries in numbers during the 1850's. DECLINE AND THE BEGINNING OF CONSOLIDATION, I866-76 The Civil War marked a definite break in the life of the United States. Politically, it established the ultimate supremacy of the federal government. It also marked a division point in Ameri- can social and cultural history. The great reform movement which characterized the decades of the 1830's, 1840's, and 1850's finally burned itself out in the slavery issue. It was another half-cen- tury before Americans again turned seriously to the quest for social justice.80 In this connection it should be noted that between the years 1866 and 1890 a revolution in American higher educa- tion took place. Ideas that had been de- bated in pre-Civil War journals-the elective system, graduate instruction, scientific courses became educational realities. New universities, more impos- ing than any the nation had seen, were built at Cornell, Johns Hopkins, Clark, Stanford, and Chicago. New towers were added to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Co- lumbia, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Along with the establishment of new institu- tions and the renovation of old went the adoption of new academic goals. To criti- cize and augment as well as to dissemi- nate the traditional learning became an established function-a great departure for a system that had aimed primarily at cultural conservation.8' The completion of this academic rev- " Zetagathian Society, "Records and Constitu- tion of the Zetagathian Society, March 13, 1863- Jan. 11, 1866" (MS), Constitution, Art.

COLLEGE LITERARY SOCIETIES 105 olution was signalized by the opening of Johns Hopkins University in 1876. This institution, whose spirit, purpose, and methods were to have far-reaching influ- ence upon higher education in the United States, had as its first president Daniel Coit Gilman, who began his academic career by representing the Linonian Li- brary of Yale College at the conference of librarians in 1853. Parallel with changes in the curricu- lum of higher education were changes in the extracurricular interests and activi- ties of the students. If a generalization can be made for the post-Civil War pe- riod, it would be that, while western col- lege societies continued to thrive after 1865, the older societies of the North and the South were not so fortunate. In fact, many expired during the Civil War or shortly thereafter. Largely responsi- ble for their decline were the rise of ath- letics; the popularity of social fraterni- ties; the competition of music clubs, dramatic clubs, and similar specialized organizations; the slow but gradual lib eralization of the curriculum with a con- sequent influx of non-forensic minded students; the spread of periodicals and other competing forms of communica- tion; and the relaxation of administra- tive regulations which removed many of the initial causes for the founding of the societies. But where the administrations were young and vigorous, as in the West, or where tradition was strong, as at Princeton, the societies held their own.82 When Professor I. C. Seeley of the University of Michigan undertook a sur- vey of existing college literary societies in 1871, he received the following letter from President James B. Angell of the University of Vermont, dated February 25, 1871: Here, as in most of the Eastern Colleges, the Secret Societies have eaten out the life of the old Literary Societies. Formerly there were two here, the "University Institute" and the "Phi Sigma Nu," but they died before any of the present generation of students came on to the ground so that no historian can be found.83 Nevertheless, Seeley was able to lo- cate 30 literary societies still active in northern colleges and 31 in southern col- leges. In ten western states he found a total of 115 literary societies. In one western state (Ohio) there were 35 col- lege societies-more than all those found in either the North or the South.84 See- ley's figures demonstrated also that it was becoming more difficult to start lit- erary societies in postwar colleges. Of the 30 northern societies, 11 were estab- lished between 1861 and 1871; of the31 southern societies, 9; and of the 115 western societies, 39.85 As the fortunes of the literary socie- ties declined, the maintenance of their libraries became an increasing burden on the members. This was especially true of the impoverished students in southern colleges during the Recon- struction Period.86 Hence it is not sur- prising that soon after the Civil War a movement was started in northern col- leges to transfer the society libraries to the college administrations. In 1876 the United States Bureau of Education made a survey of libraries throughout the nation. Although this study was entitled Public Libraries in the United States of America, it includ- ed college and university libraries as well. In doing so, the report called atten- R2 David Potter, "The Literary Society," History of Speech Ed-ucation in America: Background Studies, ed. Karl H.

106 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY tion to those libraries still operated by college societies. In eight northern states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) 637,066 volumes were reported in college librar- ies and 175,588 volumes in society li- braries.87 Especially significant were the totals for 1876 when compared with those re- ported by Rhees in 1859. In seventeen years the college libraries had grown from 552,647 to 637,006 volumes; the society libraries had declined from 209,636 to 175,588 volumes.88 Early in 1867 the faculty at Yale pro- posed a plan for a college reading room to the two literary societies. The Linon- ian Society and Brothers in Unity were invited to lay an extra tax of fifty cents per term upon each active member, to be paid to the college treasurer; and, sec- ond, each society was to make an imme- diate appropriation of $125. Thus each would contribute about $500 to the proj- ect, and the faculty would feel war- ranted in entering upon it at once.89 At the following meeting this proposition was voted upon and passed by the Lin- onians.Y0 Presumably, Brothers in Unity took the same action. Henceforth, the society libraries were supported by a tax on the members, in place of the volun- tary subscriptions and donations by which they had formerly been sustained. The reading room for their collections was opened in one of the college build- ings in the same year." This proved to be the first step in the liquidation of the two society libraries. In 1871, by vote of the societies, the li- braries were placed under the charge of the college library committee. In 1872 they were united and rearranged, and a new catalog was printed. A few hundred volumes were transferred directly to the college library; several thousand dupli- cates were set aside for sale and ex- change; and the number of volumes in the united libraries was thereby reduced to 17,000. Subsequent additions raised it to 19,000 by 1876.92 Even in its new home, the Linonia and Brothers collec- tion continued to preserve a character distinct from that of the official college library, continuing to take the field of general literature as its own. For several decades it continued to serve as a nu- cleus for library services for the Yale undergraduate.93 At Dartmouth the Social Friends and the United Fraternity decided to place their libraries under the direction of the faculty. Articles of agreement were en- tered into between the faculty and the societies, by which the latter retained certain powers and privileges. The con- solidated libraries were placed in one room, and a librarian was appointed, at a fixed salary, to take charge of the united library, which was now open con- tinuously to all students. In addition to the collections of the Social Friends and the United Fraternity, this union in- cluded the library (about 1,200 vol- umes) of the Philotechnic Society, an organization formed in the Scientific Department of Dartmouth in 1854.

COLLEGE LITERARY SOCIETIES 107 united libraries num-bered about 47,000 volumes in 1876, of which 27,000 be- longed to the societies.94 The three societies approved the new arrangement in 1874. The transfer of the administration of the libraries to the college trustees and the lack of any meetings of the societies soon made the existence of the latter wholly artificial. Finally, a special act of the New Hamp- shire legislature authorizing the sale or gift to the trustees of the libraries of the three societies was approved in 1903. In the same year all the societies voted unanimously to transfer by formal sale their libraries to the trustees of the col- lege. The transfer was completed in 1904.95 Despite the size of the college library (154,000 volumes), society libraries were still flourishing at Harvard in 1876.01 The library of the Institute of 1770 numbered about 3,500 volumes; that of the Porcellian Club amounted to 7,000 volumes; and that of the Hasty- Pudding Club numbered about 4,000 volumes.7 On the other hand, the Alex- andrian and Athenaean societies at Am- herst College were anxious to dispose of their libraries, which contained 8,127 volumes. In 1867 they received permis- sion to merge their libraries with the col- lege library, as a gift from the societies, on certain specified conditions. However, the books could not be transferred from the halls of the societies until a new li- brary building was completed.98 In 1873 the library committee of the two soci- eties petitioned again to deposit their books in the college library and proposed that the money received from the soci- eties "be expended in popular works." The faculty library committee decided that this was "inexpedient at present." It was not until 1875 that the college again approved the transfer."9 When the Literary Fraternity and the Erosophian Adelphi Society at Colby College decided to adjourn sine die in 1878, they voted to turn over their li- braries to the faculty. From the two societies the Colby College Library re- ceived about 4,000 volumes.100 At Dick- inson College the libraries of the Belles Lettres Literary Society and the Union Philosophical Society retained their sep- arate existence until 1886, when they were moved into a new library building, along with the college library. At that time each of the society libraries had about 10,000 volumes. Soon after 1886 the library administration was taken over by the college, and a member of the faculty became librarian.101 At the University of Pennsylvania the Zelosophic Society had greatly curtailed its activities after 1876. In 1904 Albert Smith Faught was appointed chairman of a committee of the Zelosophic Society to consider the project of transferring by gift the society's library to the uni- versity library. At that time the society's library contained about 800 volumes, in- cluding a thirteen-volume set of the En- ' U.S. Bureau of Education, op. cit., p. 99. 5 John King Lord, A History of Dartmouth College, 1815-1909 ...

108 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY cyclopaedia Americana.'02 At a meeting on February 17, 1904, the members of the society voted to give their library to the trustees of the university.103 After 1865 few new society libraries were started in northern colleges. One of the exceptions was at Muhlenberg Col- lege, which was founded in 1867. There both the Euterpean Society and the So- phronian Society established their own libraries. The Euterpeans had a library of 1,225 volumes in 1875 and of 2,151 volumes in 1892. In the latter year the Sophronian Society had 1,700 books in its library. However, after the first twen- ty-five years the society libraries very nearly stopped growing. Meanwhile, during the first twenty years the Muh- lenberg College Library added approxi- mately 2,500 volumes, while the two society libraries had acquired 3,851 vol- umes in the first twenty-five years. In the fall of 1904 Muhlenberg College was moved to a new location, and the three libraries were shelved in one room. Fi- nally, in 1912 the three collections were combined physically into a single college library.'04 In his survey Seeley received reports of only five southern college societies, yet there was ample evidence that such societies continued to maintain their li- braries well into the 1880's. In 1876 the United States Bureau of Education re- ported 136,368 volumes in the college libraries and 47,545 volumes in the so- ciety libraries in the District of Colum- bia and seven southern states. Between 1859 and 1876 both the college and the society libraries of the South showed a decline in the number of volumes-the former by 299,601 and the latter by 46,564 volumes. In North Carolina the libraries of the Euzelian and Philomathesian societies at Wake Forest College were consoli- dated into one general library under the control of the trustees of the college. In 1886 the University of North Carolina Library and the libraries of the two lit- erary societies were united and named "The Library of the University of North Carolina Endowed by the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies." In 1887 the li- braries of Davidson College and her so- cieties, the Eumenean and the Philan- thropic, were joined to become the Da- vidson College Library. In the same year the libraries of Trinity College and of the two societies, Columbian and Hes- perian, were consolidated and became the Trinity College Library.105 The transfer of the Dialectic and Phil- anthropic collections at North Carolina was especially interesting, since it fol- lowed closely the consolidation of the college and society libraries at Dart- mouth in 1874. At North Carolina the society libraries were received into the university library in 1886, but they re- mained the property of the societies. If dissatisfied, either society could with- draw from the contract by giving six months' notice. The Dialectic and Phil- anthropic collections were shelved sepa- rately, and the books of the university library were divided equally and shelved with them. This arrangement continued for twenty years. Not until 1906 did the two societies finally agree to transfer to the university all their proprietary in- terests in the library.106 At the University of Georgia the use ' Letter from Albert Smith Faught to Morris Jastrow, librarian, University of Pennsylvania, February 15, 1904. 1" Letter from Albert Smith Faught to Morris Jastrow, February 22, 1904. 106 John S.

COLLEGE LITERARY SOCIETIES 109 of the Demosthenian and Phi Kappa libraries declined rapidly after 1876. Finally, the two societies donated all their records and books to the Depart- ment of History of the university. In turn the latter turned them over to the university library in the 1920's.1O7 The libraries of the literary societies of the University of South Carolina also de- clined.108 The Clariosophic Society of- fered its library to the university, but the latter would agree only to place a bookplate in each volume ascribing it to the donating society. The Clariosophians did not accept this arrangement until 1913, when the library was finally in- corporated with the university library.109 At smaller colleges in the South many society libraries underwent a similar transition from society to college owner- ship during the last quarter of the nine- teenth century. At Randolph-Macon College in Virginia, the Washington and Franklin Literary societies offered their libraries, consisting of about 4,000 vol- umes, to the board of trustees in 1886. The latter accepted the offer, and the li- brarian was directed to consolidate them with the college library."0 At Wofford College in South Carolina the libraries of both the Calhoun and the Preston societies were united with that of the college in 1894. At the time of the union, it was estimated that the Calhoun library contained about 3 000 volumes; the Preston library about 2,500 volumes; and the college library about 4,000 vol- umes."' Likewise, at Southern Univer- sity in Alabama the Belles Lettres So- ciety deeded its library to the university in 1899.112 The acquisition of the Clario- sophian Society Library by the Univer- sity of South Carolina in 1913 may be said to close an era of library consolida- tion which began in the South about 1876. In the eastern colleges the literary so- cieties had reached their full strength and had already begun to decline by the time of the Civil War, but in western institutions they did not attain their greatest strength until sometime later. Indeed, they were the most popular and powerful student organizations in west- ern colleges and universities for at least two decades after the Civil War."3 Society libraries still flourished in western colleges, along with the societies themselves. In his survey in 1871 Seeley reported a total of twenty-four society libraries with 23,500 volumes in the col- leges of six western states."4 In 1876 the United States Bureau of Education found a total of 130,659 volumes in the college libraries and 46,216 volumes in the society libraries of Indiana, Michi- gan, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin."' In two of the Ohio colleges (Kenyon and Marietta) the college libraries were only slightly larger than the society li- braries.

110 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY versity, and the University of Minnesota reported that no society libraries were in existence in 1876."1 At Ohio University the library of the Athenian Society included almost 1,500 volumes by 1865.117 Both the Athenians and the Philomatheans kept their li- braries in their meeting rooms and locked from everyone except their own members. However, after the literary societies had opened their meetings to the public, the two libraries were merged with a third, which had been started by the university, to form a substantial be- ginning for the present university li- brary."18 At Oberlin College the men's societies united into the College Societies Library Association in 1854, while the women's societies formed the Ladies Societies Li- brary Association five years later. In 1874 both of these libraries were united under the title of the Union Library As- sociation. The new library grew from 3,058 volumes in 1874 to 14,456 vol- umes in 1908. In the latter year the Union Library Association was given to the college. In the opinion of the college librarian, Azariah S. Root, the Union Li- brary Association "was for many years the most important library connected with the institution, and up to the early 90's was easily more valuable than the College Library.""' At Hiram College the libraries of the Delphic and Hesperian societies were assembled with the college library and placed in the care of a joint librarian during the 1880's.12O At Otterbein Uni- versity the Philomathean Society had a library of 250 volumes in 1876. Their rivals, the Philophroneans, acquired some 388 books between 1871 and 1875. In 1908 the libraries of the two societies contained 4,000 volumes. In that year they were donated to the university li- brary after it moved into a new build- ing.121 Their example was followed by the two women's societies, which had es- tablished small libraries of their own.'22 The first decade of the twentieth cen- tury may be said to close an era which began about 1876. This era saw the transfer of the society libraries from their original ownership to that of the colleges or universities themselves. This development may be said to open a new chapter in higher education: the as- sumption by the colleges and universities of responsibility for developing their heretofore meager libraries into strong collections to support their programs of instruction and research. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Merle Curti and Vernon Carstensen, in their history of the University of Wis- consin and its literary societies, attribute the decline of the societies to the fact that "most of their educational features were incorporated in the course of 6 Ibid.

COLLEGE LITERARY SOCIETIES 111 study."'293 Four specific illustrations sup- port this generalization. First, debating and public speaking activities became part of the curriculum, thereby depriv- ing the literary society of its major justification for existence. Second, the college or university administration as- sumed responsibility for the annual com- mencement activities, which included securing well-known speakers. Along with this development, the honorary de- gree took the place of the honorary membership in the societies. Third, oth- er student groups assumed responsibility for editing or publishing the college mag- azines, which were often started by the literary societies.'24 Finally, most of the society libraries were absorbed by the college or university libraries. In fact, this was the most clear-cut example where the literary society lost one of its most important functions to the college administration. This study was undertaken to answer the following questions: What kind of libraries did the literary societies estab- lish? How did they compare with col- lege libraries in quantity and quality? Why did they flourish before the Civil War, and why did they virtually disap- pear by the end of the nineteenth cen- tury? It has been shown that before the Civil War the society libraries were usu- ally superior to the college library in quality and, sometimes, in quantity. After the Civil War most of the societies rapidly lost interest in their libraries. Probably the declining membership of the societies (at least in the northern and most of the southern societies) made the support of their libraries an impossi- ble burden. Therefore, they were eager to turn their library responsibilities over to the college and university administra- tions. Before 1865 the society libraries had been far more accessible to their members, and sometimes to other stu- dents as well, than the college libraries. Continued access to the society books by the members was usually a condition im- posed by the societies when they sur- rendered possession of their libraries to the college authorities. Finally, the absorption of the society libraries by the college collections oc- curred at the very time when the latter, under librarians like lustin Winsor, were breaking away from the tradition of book conservation, and were beginning to think in terms of service to readers. It may be significant that many of the new generation of librarians who were instrumental in organizing the American Library Association in 1876 were them- selves active in literary societies in their college years. A few examples will illustrate this point. Charles Coffin Jewett (librarian, Brown University; Smithsonian Institu- tion; Boston Public Library) began his career as librarian of the Philermenian Society Library at Brown University.'25 Two librarians of Harvard University, John Langdon Sibley and Justin Winsor, were members of the Institute of 1770.126 John Edmands (Mercantile Library, Philadelphia) served as librarian of "' Op. cit., I, 438. 12 These activities have been documented in Thomas S. Harding, "College Literary Societies: Their Contribution to Higher Education in the United States, 1815-1876" (unpublished Ph.D. dis- sertation, Department of History, University of Chicago, 1957), chaps. ii, iv, vi, viii, x, xii, and xiv, passim, ' Borome, op. cit., p. 6. 12 Institute of 1770, Catalogue of the Officers and Members of the Institute of 1770, of Harvard University (Cambridge: Welch, Bigelow & Co., 1868), passim; see also Joseph A.

112 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY Brothers in Unity at Yale, where he was succeeded by William Frederick Poole (Boston Athenaeum; Cincinnati Public Library; Chicago Public Library; New- berry Library).17 Two other leading nineteenth-century librarians were mem- bers of Harvard societies: Charles Ammi Cutter (Boston Athenaeum; Forbes Li- brary, Northampton, Massachusetts) in Phi Beta Kappa; and Joseph Kendall Hosmer (Minneapolis Public Library) in the Hasty-Pudding Club.128 Walter Stanley Biscoe, who was associated with Melvil Dewey in the development of the Dewey Decimal Classification, was ac- tive in the Athenian Society at Am- herst.129 It is possible that their interest in librarianship and the development of their policies tending to make library collections more serviceable had their beginnings in their experiences as mem- bers of literary societies. Though the day when the literary so- ciety was the dominant activity on the college campus has long passed, there is still room for such a society as a part of the students' extracurricular activities. The present-day literary society can still serve as a discussion group wherein the members can voice their opinions on their immediate problems as well as on current national and international events. With the United States now ranking as a world power, certainly the need for informed student opinion is as great as it was in the nineteenth century, when Americans were concerned primar- ily with domestic problems. No other vehicle for expressing student opinion has equaled the college literary society. The nineteenth-century college soci- ety library also served a useful function by providing books in fiction, drama, poetry, voyages and travel, and Ameri- can history, which were not to be found in the college libraries of the period. Wherever any kind of reading materials are lacking, there is room for an inde- pendent library.
