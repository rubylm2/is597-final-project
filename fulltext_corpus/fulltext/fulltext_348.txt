SIMILARITIES IN CIRCULATION PATTERNS AMONG PUBLIC LIBRARY BRANCHES SERVING DIVERSE POPULATIONS John R. Ottensmann,' Raymond E. Gnat,2 and Michael E. Gleeson' This article examines the circulation of adult books in public library branches and the distribution of circulation across subject categories for the Indianapolis- Marion County Public Library. As found in many other studies, levels of circula- tion varied widely among branches and were related to the characteristics of the populations served. The distributions of the subjects of the books circulated did not vary greatly between branches or between groups of branches classified by social and economic characteristics. Both traditional statistical measures and the index of dissimilarity were used to ascertain the degree of differences in circulation patterns among the branches. In only some subject categories were branch circulation levels related to various social and economic characteristics of the populations served. Public library branches in large cities serve very diverse populations. The areas served by individual branches can vary greatly in terms of the incomes, occupations, educational levels, and ethnicity of their residents. These differences can be important for the libraries, affecting service needs and circulation levels in branches serving various areas. What is less clear is the effect that such population differences have on the types of materials circulated by such public library branches. Given the importance of the social and economic characteristics of ser- vice area populations for matters such as levels of library utilization, it might be plausible to assume that branches serving very different service area populations might exhibit very different circulation patterns. One can equally well hypothesize that while readership levels may differ among different populations, for those who actually use the libraries and read the books, the types of books which they read might not vary greatly. 1.

90 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY The nature of circulation patterns and the differences or similarities across branches are important for public library systems in meeting the needs of their patrons. Decisions about collection development and the allocation of materials acquisition budgets should depend upon the de- mands exhibited in the various branches. Indeed, questions of whether acquisition is best handled at the branch level or on a centralized basis may depend upon the degrees of similarity of circulation patterns across the various branches. This research examines the patterns of circulation of adult books across the twenty-one branches serving local areas of the Indianapolis- Marion County Public Library. Rates of circulation vary widely among the branches, which serve very diverse populations. However, the distri- butions of circulation across various categories of adult books were very similar among the various branches. We found that those persons who checked out and read books tended to read very similar types of materi- als without regard to the characteristics of the populations served by the branches. Furthermore, circulation patterns in the branches were only weakly related to the social and economic characteristics of the populations served by the branches. The following section of this article reviews prior studies of public library use. We then present the circulation data and the service area characteristics for the branch libraries in Indianapolis that are used for the subsequent analysis. Next, we examine the variation in overall circu- lation levels among the branches and the relationships of these levels to the characteristics of the populations in the areas served. We then address the central question of this article: To what extent are patterns of circulation-the distribution of circulation across different categories of books-similar or different among the branches? This question is addressed using both traditional statistical tests and a more direct mea- sure called the index of dissimilarity. Finally, we examine the relation- ships between branch circulation patterns and the social and economic characteristics of the populations in the areas served by the branches. Prior Studies of Public Library Use Many studies have examined levels of public library use and have com- pared these to the characteristics of individual users or the populations of the areas served by the libraries. These studies generally have shown various demographic characteristics, especially educational levels, to be strongly related to library use. Little, however, has been done to exam- ine variations in the types of materials used by different populations. The greatest number of studies involve examinations of library use
SIMILARITIES IN CIRCULATION PATTERNS 91 by individuals and comparisons of levels of use with individual charac- teristics. Douglas Zweizig and Brenda Dervin [1] reviewed sixteen stud- ies of library use, and education was found to be strongly and positively related to library use in all of the studies, while other measures of socio- economic status and race had weaker relationships to levels of use. Carol Kronus [2] summarized forty-five studies of adult library use and re- ported that age, sex, education, and occupation were found to be sig- nificant factors in a high proportion of those studies. Zweizig [3] con- ducted a telephone survey of individuals in the Syracuse area and found education and socioeconomic status (measured by occupation) to be most positively related to the level of library use of all of the demo- graphic variables considered, while race was not significant. A study by the Gallup Organization [4] involved a national telephone survey on library use and book reading and found both reading and library use to be positively related to level of education. Robert Hayes and Susan Palmer [5] studied the effects of distance upon public library use in Los Angeles and found library use to be consistently higher for persons with higher levels of education. Janet Lange [6], in a telephone survey in a southwestern state, found the best predictors of library use versus non-use to be demographic characteristics, especially college education. Choong Kim and Robert Little [7] and Kim [8] surveyed library users at various libraries in Indiana (including Indianapolis) to examine the relationships between occupation and library use and found substantial variation in library use by occupation. They also found educational level to be related to library use. Other studies have compared levels of library use with characteristics of the populations in the areas served by the libraries. Edwin Parker and William Paisley [9] examined differences in circulation levels across libraries in the United States and found positive relationships to educa- tion, income, and race of the populations served. Robert Coughlin, Francoise Taieb, and Benjamin Stevens [10, pp. 39-42] studied library use in Philadelphia and found that most variations in per capita output levels of branch libraries could be explained by the characteristics of residents of service areas-mean household income, percentage of peo- ple with some college education, and percentage of males employed as professionals, managers, or officials. Frank Levy, Arnold Meltsner, and Aaron Wildavsky [11, p. 210], in a study of the Oakland (California) Library System, found that library branches located in poor neighbor- hoods tended to have fewer books circulated per resident than branches in average or comfortable neighborhoods. Snunith Shoham, Sara Hersh- kovitz, and Dalya Metzer [12] studied library use in Tel Aviv and found higher proportions of the population registered as library users in neighborhoods with higher levels of education, more persons working
92 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY in higher-status occupations, and higher proportions of automobile ownership. Far less research has been undertaken to examine the types of materi- als used by public library patrons and how this might or might not vary with the characteristics of the populations served. Levy, Meltsner, and Wildavsky [11, p. 196] reported a study by Michael Teitz and his stu- dents that examined requests and borrowing in the Oakland branches using books classified by the major (100-level) Dewey decimal classifica- tions: "They found, by and large, the same demands in all branches. Since Oakland's population manifests considerable variety and there are geographic concentrations of groups by race, income, and education, they concluded that the library attracted a certain type of user, who is found to some extent in all areas of the city. But there are more of these typical users in some neighborhoods. Circulation statistics show they are found disproportionately in areas with high income and educa- tional levels. Circulation is high where they are concentrated and low where they are not." They also did a more detailed comparison of two branches, one high income and one low income, examining circulation, books received, and book orders filled. The two branches exhibited gen- eral similarities in most categories, but the high-income branch showed a stronger preference for fiction, while the low-income branch preferred books on sociology and government (with a strong emphasis on books on jobs and careers). They concluded that this more refined analysis showed that reader preferences do differ significantly from one part of the city to another, contradicting their earlier conclusion [11, pp. 196-98]. Given the conflicting results from these analyses, one is left very uncertain as to whether or not the types of materials circulated by branch libraries varies significantly among branches, the question which this article seeks to answer. Branch Library Circulation Rates and Service Area Characteristics This research examines the patterns of circulation of adult books of various types across the twenty-one branches of the Indianapolis- Marion County Library system. This section begins by describing the data on circulation used in the analysis. It then examines the social and economic characteristics of the areas served by those branches. Circulation Rates The analysis covers the twenty-one branch libraries in Indianapolis. The Central Library is excluded, as its larger collection serves the entire city
SIMILARITIES IN CIRCULATION PATTERNS 93 for more specialized needs. Also excluded is the Extension Division of the library, which provides specialized services to specific populations. The source of the circulation data for the analysis is the set of monthly reports on circulation for the year 1988 for each of the branches. These reports were generated by the CLSI computerized circulation system and provide detailed breakdowns of circulation by over two hundred subject categories. The analysis focuses on the circulation of adult books in the fiction and Dewey decimal categories. The circulation of juvenile books and nonprint materials was not considered. The detailed circulation information for all of 1988 was aggregated into a smaller set of subject categories that are equivalent to the set of categories used by the library for materials acquisition budgeting for the Central Library. This aggregation was done to reduce the number of categories to a more manageable number. The materials acquisition budgeting categories were used because these categories are significant for decision making in the library system. Analyses comparable to those reported in this article were also done with the original, unaggregated data and produced results comparable to those being reported here. Table 1 lists the subject categories used in the analysis and the Dewey decimal ranges or other subject descriptors associated with each of the categories. This table also lists the total circulation of the twenty-one branches in each category, along with the percentage distribution. The total volume of circulation of adult books in these branches during 1988 was about one and one-half million. Adult fiction accounted for the largest share of the circulation, over one quarter of the total. Mysteries represented an additional 10 percent of the total branch circulation. Service Area Characteristics To identify those census tracts primarily served by each of the branches, the Indianapolis-Marion County library conducted a study of the distri- bution of individual patron registration by census tract. These branch service areas identified by the library were used for the analyses compar- ing circulation to the social and economic characteristics of the popula- tions served by the branches. Data on selected social and economic characteristics of the populations in the census tracts were obtained from the 1980 Census of Population and Housing [13]. Variables were selected that are fairly standard mea- sures of population characteristics and that the literature suggests may be related to library use. These tract-level data were aggregated to the service areas for the twenty-one branches. Five measures of the popula- tion characteristics of the service areas are considered-age, race, edu- cation, income, and occupation. The general age structure of the popu- lation is measured by the percentage of the population aged eighteen

The race variable is the percentage of the population that is black; Indianapolis has relatively few members of other racial or ethnic minorities. Education is the percentage of the population aged twenty- five and over who have graduated from high school. The mean income of households indicates overall economic well-being. Finally, the occupa- tional level of the population is measured by taking the percentage of those persons who are employed who work in white-collar occupations (professional, managerial, sales, and clerical).
SIMILARITIES IN CIRCULATION PATTERNS 95 Several caveats need to be mentioned regarding the use of this service area data. First, the data are from the 1980 census and are being com- pared with 1988 circulation data. Some changes will have occurred in neighborhood populations during the eight-year period, but such changes would be relatively modest in most areas. The use of the tract data from the decennial census is generally required in these types of analyses, and the relatively minor changes in tract characteristics caused by such lags do not create problems in most cases, especially with tract data aggregated to larger areas. (For a discussion of the extent of changes in census tract data over the ten-year periods from census to census, see John Ottensmann [ 14].) A second issue involves the fact that the service areas identified for the branches will not precisely identify the populations served by each branch for several reasons. First, the area in which each branch is domi- nant will not coincide exactly with census tract boundaries. Second, all of the persons in any given area will not use the same library. Patrons are free to borrow from any branch, so service areas will overlap as the patrons select different branches. Thus, in comparing branch circula- tion to service area characteristics, the comparison is to the populations in the areas which the branches predominantly serve. The comparison of branch circulation to the service area characteristics is appropriate for examining the relationship of branches to their potential patron populations, whether or not served. Also, the effects of errors caused by overlaps in service areas and by the fact that service areas do not conform to tract boundaries will be minimized because adjacent census tracts usually (but not always) have similar population characteristics. Table 2 presents the social and economic characteristics of the popula- tions in each of the twenty-one branch service areas. It is readily appar- ent that there are wide variations in the service area characteristics, as would be expected in a large, heterogeneous metropolitan area. Age shows the smallest differences, but even there, the percentage of the population aged eighteen and over ranges from 62 to nearly 79 percent. The percentage of the population that is black in the service areas varies from virtually none to over 90 percent. The service areas with the least- educated population had only 37 percent of all adults graduated from high school, while at the other extreme, in the best-educated service area, over 90 percent of adults had graduated from high school. Mean family incomes ranged from a low of about $12,000 to a high of over $32,000, over two and one-half times as great. Finally, the percentage of employed persons in white collar occupations was as low as 32 percent in one service area and over 83 percent in another. One-way analyses of variance using census tracts as the units of analysis were conducted to determine whether the differences between mean characteristics

Relationship between Circulation Rates and Service Area Characteristics Prior studies cited above have shown that overall circulation levels of library branches can vary greatly with the social and economic character- istics of the populations served. This is true also for the branch libraries in Indianapolis. The examination of the differences in overall levels of circulation between the branches is not the primary objective of this study. It is being examined in this section to demonstrate the extent of the differences among the branches, differences that would be expected
SIMILARITIES IN CIRCULATION PATTERNS 97 to affect patterns of branch circulation to the extent that the social and economic differences in the populations served created such differ- ences. Two measures of branch circulation performance were considered for this analysis. The first is the total adult book circulation divided by the total population of the service area aged eighteen and over, a mea- sure of the extent to which the adult population is using the library. The second is the total circulation divided by the branch adult book stock-the turnover rate-a measure of the extent to which the library is being used. The first measure of circulation per adult population is an approximation, given that the delineated service areas can only approximate the population served by any branch, as discussed above. Nevertheless, it provides a rough measure of the extent to which the adult populations in the service areas are using their libraries. These circulation rates-circulation per adult population and circula- tion per book stock-are reported for the individual branches in table 3. Immediately noticeable is the very wide variation in these rates across the branches. The mean circulation divided by service area adult popu- lation is 2.65, but the branches range from a low of .38 to a high of 6.24, with a standard deviation of 1.78. Likewise, the turnover rates for the adult book stock range from .76 to 5.10, with a nmean value of 2.66 annual circulations per volume and a standard deviation of 1.04. The relationships between the branch circulation rates and the service area characteristics were examined using correlation analysis. Table 4 presents the correlations across the twenty-one branches of these mea- sures of circulation performance with the branch service area character- istics. (These and subsequent correlation coefficients reported in this article are all Pearson product-moment correlations.) All of these corre- lation coefficients are statistically significant at the .05 level. The strong- est relationships were with the education, income, and occupational characteristics of the service areas. The correlations of these variables with the circulation per adult population are all over .8, and the correla- tions with the turnover rate all exceed .7. Branches in which the service area populations had higher levels of socioeconomic status as measured by these variables had higher levels of circulation. On the other hand, branches with higher black populations had lower levels of circulation, indicated by the negative correlations, though the results were not quite as strong. The higher the proportion of the population aged eighteen and over, the higher the adult circulation as well. Branch circulation performance and the social and economic charac- teristics of the branch service areas vary significantly from branch to branch, and these are strongly related to one another. Thus, if service area characteristics were to affect the types of books circulated by branch

Comparison of Circulation Patterns across Branches This section examines the similarities (and differences) in the circulation of different types of adult books across the twenty-one branches. Results from using traditional statistical techniques are presented first, but they provide only a general picture of the extent to which the circulation patterns are similar or different. A measure called the index of dissimi- larity is then employed to more precisely show the extent to which the circulation patterns across the branches differ from the overall pattern and from one another.

Traditional Statistical Tests Both contingency table analysis and correlation analysis can provide information on the extent of similarity and difference in circulation patterns across the branches. Such measures have value because of their familiarity and are presented in this section. Prior to describing the analyses, an explanation must be provided concerning the use of tests of statistical significance at various points in this article. The data being used represent the complete circulation sta- tistics for 1988-they are not a sample. So in one sense, tests of statistical significance are unnecessary and inappropriate for drawing inferences about branch library circulation in Indianapolis in 1988. However, our interest extends beyond this particular year to circulation patterns in Indianapolis in general and, ultimately, to public library circulation more broadly. The (complete) 1988 circulation data can be viewed as a sample (though certainly not a random sample) from this broader population of interest. Tests of statistical significance can then be seen as being appropriate as approximate guides to the extent to which the findings for Indianapolis in 1988 might be generalized to these broader populations. (For further discussion of this application of tests of statisti- cal significance, see Edwin Thomas and David Anderson [15] and Franklin Graybill and Hariharan Iyer [16, pp. 5-10].) The tabulation of circulation broken down by subject category and
100 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY branch form a large contingency table (thirty-one subject categories by twenty-one branches), with the frequency of circulation for each subject category in each branch. As such, the procedures used for the analysis of contingency tables are appropriate for examining the relationship between subject categories and branches. Such procedures can be used to address two questions: Is there a statistically significant difference in circulation patterns among branches? and What is the strength of that relationship? A chi-square test is appropriate for determining whether the differences among branches in the pattern of circulation across sub- ject categories is statistically significant. The value of chi-square for this test is 48,687 with 600 degrees of freedom, which is statistically signifi- cant at the .001 level. The existence of such a statistically significant relationship is not, however, very meaningful in this case. The contin- gency table has an N of over one and one-half million cases, making it certain that virtually any differences in circulation pattern by branch could not be due to sampling variability. More useful with such a contingency table is a measure of the strength of the relationship between subject category and branch, that is, the extent to which the branch affects the pattern of circulation across the subject categories. A variety of measures of the strength of relationships in contingency tables is available. The lambda statistic is commonly used and has the advantage of being interpretable as the proportional reduc- tion of error in predicting frequencies in one category that can be ob- tained through knowledge of the second category. In the present case, the question is whether knowledge of the branch can reduce the error in the prediction of the frequency distribution of circulation across subject categories. The value of lambda in this case, with subject category as the dependent variable, is .0 17. That is, knowledge of the branch would result in less than a 2 percent reduction in error in predicting the circu- lation by subject category. Similar low values for the strength of the relationship are obtained by examining other measures of relationship in contingency tables. The result of the contingency table analysis is therefore not very infor- mative. The relationship between branch and subject category is statisti- cally significant, given the extremely large number of cases. However, the strength of this relationship is extremely small. Correlation analysis represents an alternative approach using tradi- tional statistical measures to examine the similarities and differences in circtulation patterns across branches. Since the interest is in the differ- ence or similarity in the circulation patterns across subject categories among branches, the correlation coefficients across subject categories were calculated for each pair of branches. Each of these correlation coefficients indicates the extent to which the circulation pattern across
SIMILARITIES IN CIRCULATION PATTERNS 101 the subject categories in one branch is similar to the circulation pattern in the second branch. A correlation of 1.0 would mean that the two branches have an identical distribution of circulation across the subject categories, while a correlation of zero would imply no relationship be- tween the two patterns. This correlation analysis produced 210 unique correlation coefficients for the relationships between the different combinations of the twenty- one branches. Given the size of this correlation matrix, it is not pre- sented in this article. The mean value of these correlation coefficients was .98, meaning that the circulation in one branch was very highly related to the circulation in the second branch when compared across the categories. The smallest correlation coefficient was .85 and the largest was .999. Only three of the correlation coefficients were less than .90, while 189 of the 210 exceeded .95. Thus, the pattern of circulation across the subject categories in any one branch was very highly related to the circulation in another branch for all the pairs of branches. Tests for statistical significance are inappropriate in this case. The usual test of significance for a correlation coefficient examines whether that coefficient is statistically significant from zero, that is whether there is any relationship. All of the correlation coefficients examined were highly significant in this sense, but this only means that the circulation in one branch had some relationship to the circulation in another branch. There is no test of statistical significance for whether the circula- tion patterns across pairs of branches are identical, for any correlation that is not 1.0 represents a statistically significant difference from an identical pattern. While the contingency table analysis shows there are statistically sig- nificant differences in circulation patterns between branches, those differences are very small. Correlations of circulation across subject cate- gories between branches are very high, indicating very significant simi- larities in branch circulation patterns. Developing a more accurate pic- ture requires a direct measure of the similarities and dissimilarities in the circulation patterns. Indexes of Dissimilarity What is required is a measure that will allow examination of the extent to which the circulation pattern of any branch library differs from the overall patterns for all of the branches or from other, individual branches. The circulation pattern for any branch or for the total can be expressed as a percentage distribution of the total number of items circulated across the various subject categories. Therefore, comparing these circulation patterns calls for a measure capable of comparing two percentage distributions across the same set of categories.
102 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY A wide variety of indices have been developed to measure the degree of similarity or difference between two percentage distributions (see, for example, Philip Coulter [17], pp. 135-59). Otis Dudley Duncan and Beverly Duncan developed the measure which they called the index of dissimilarity, D, which was originally used for measuring residential segregation by race within urban areas [181. In measuring segregation, the index compares the distributions of blacks and whites across small areas within a city. The Duncans' index of dissimilarity is an attractive choice for the present application, as it is a straightforward, easy-to- understand measure that provides for the direct comparison of two percentage distributions across the same set of categories. It also pos- sesses the advantage that the values of the index can be readily inter- preted as the percentage of the elements in one distribution that would have to be moved to other categories in order to make that distribution identical to a second distribution. The index of dissimilarity is defined as one-half the sum of the abso- lute values of the differences between two percentage distributions: D = 1/2 X:i lxi -yil , where xi is the percentage in category i in the first distribution and y, is the percentage in category i in the second distribution, with the sum- mation over all of the categories. For example, suppose we have the percentage distributions of circula- tion across three subject categories for one branch and for the total circulation of all of the branches: PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL CIRCULATION SUBJECT ABSOLUTE CATEGORY Branch A All Branches DIFFERENCE VALUE 1 30 25 5 5 2 45 55 - 10 10 3 25 20 5 5 Total 100 100 0 20 Some of the differences in percent of total circulation between branch A and the total circulation for all of the branches will be positive and some will be negative. Taking the absolute values makes all of the num- bers positive. The sum of the absolute values of the differences in this
SIMILARITIES IN CIRCULATION PATTERNS 103 example is 20. One half of this is 10, the value of the index of dissimi- larity. The index of dissimilarity can range from zero to 100. The index will have the minimum value of zero (no dissimilarity) when the two percentage distributions are identical. In comparing circulation distribu- tions, this would mean that the percentages of the total circulation in each subject category would be the same for both distributions. The index will have the maximum value of 100 (total dissimilarity) in the case when the two percentage distributions have nonzero percentages in different categories. In comparing circulation distributions, this ex- treme situation would occur only if circulation in each subject category occurred only in one distribution but not the other, or, put another way, the two distributions have circulation in mutually exclusive subsets of the subject categories. Perhaps the most important feature of the index of dissimilarity is that it is a measure of the percentage of the units in one distribution that would have to be reallocated among categories to make the distribution identical to the second distribution. In the simple example given above, the index of dissimilarity is 10. That is the percentage of the total circu- lation in branch A that would have to be reallocate(d to other subject categories in order to make branch A's circulation pattern identical to the total circulation pattern for all branches. This translates directly to comparisons involving other variables which might be distributed in the same manner as circulation. Suppose that the materials acquisition budget were to be allocated to subject categories in proportion to the circulation in each category. What would be the difference between making such an allocation for any branch based upon the pattern of total circulation for the entire system, as compared with making the allocation based upon the circulation in the individual branch? One could use the index of dissimilarity comparing the percent- age distribution for the total system circulation across subject categories to the percentage distribution for the branch. The value for this index of dissimilarity can then be interpreted as the percentage of the materials acquisition budget using one allocation method that would have to be reallocated to other subject categories to make the distribution identical to the other allocation. The index of dissimilarity can be used in two distinct ways to examine the differences in circulation patterns among branch libraries. First, the percentage distributions of the circulation across subject categories in branch libraries can be compared with the distribution of the total circu- lation for all of the branch libraries, with the corresponding indexes of dissimilarity being computed. This approach measures the difference in each branch's circulation pattern from the overall pattern. It would
104 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY be appropriate for addressing questions regarding the extent to which decisions based upon individual branch circulation patterns would dif- fer from decisions based upon the total circulation pattern for all of the branches. The second approach would compare the percentage dis- tributions of circulation in each branch with every other branch, with all possible pairs of indexes of dissimilarity being computed. This would provide a picture of the maximum differences in circulation patterns between individual branches. In the first approach, comparing the branch circulation distribution to the total for all branches, one is in effect measuring the dissimilarity or variation associated with the distribution for the individual branch, as this is being compared to the total or average distribution. In the second approach, comparing the branch circulation distributions to one another, one would be measuring the dissimilarity or variation associ- ated with both of the branches. One would expect considerably greater dissimilarity (perhaps even twice as much) between individual branches when compared with the dissimilarity of the branches to the total branch circulation distribution. Taking the first approach, the indexes of dissimilarity for each branch compared with the distribution of circulation across the subject catego- ries for all branches were calculated and are displayed in table 5. All of the values for the index of dissimilarity are relatively small, ranging from less than 4 to about 19, with a mean value across branches of 9.26. The largest value of 19 for the Flanner House branch indicates that 19 percent of its circulation would have to have come in other categories for the circulation pattern to be identical to the overall total. At the other extreme, for branches like Eagle and Lawrence, only about 4 percent of the circulation would have to be moved to other categories for their patterns to be identical to the overall total. The relatively small values for the indexes of dissimilarity confirm the impressions from the previous analyses and provide more direct measures of the similarities and differences. There are some measurable differences between branches in their circulation patterns, but these differences are quite modest. Any judgments based upon those circula- tion patterns are unlikely to be affected by the small differences between the branches. Another perspective on the observed differences in circulation pat- terns can be obtained by considering dissimilarity values in relation to the sizes of the branches. The tendency is for smaller branches to have higher values for the index of dissimilarity (to be more different from the overall pattern). The correlation between the branch circulations and the indexes of dissimilarity is .73. Consider that a number of the branches have annual circulations in the subject categories of 15,000

One percent of the Flanner House circulation is eighty items. Therefore, a relatively small number of patrons with unusual reading interests could have a major effect on the circulation pattern for such a small branch, making the small branch patterns more dissimilar. The second approach investigates the differences among the individ- ual branches, comparing the circulation distributions across subject cate- gories of one branch to another. Indexes of dissimilarit) were computed for each pair of branches, yielding a total of 210 unique index values. Table 6 presents summary information on this set of between-branch index values. As we expected, values of the dissimilarity indexes between individual branches are larger than the values of the dissimilarity in- dexes comparing branch circulation to the total circulation distribution. For the various branches, the mean of the indexes of dissimilarity to
106 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY the other branches ranged from 10 to 21. The smallest values were less than 5, representing pairs of branches that had circulation distributions that were very similar, where only a change in a few percent of the circulation in one branch would make its distribution identical to the other. The maximum value for the index of dissimilarity was over 26, indicating rather more substantial differences between the branches in the distribution of circulation. These results are generally consistent with and expected from the prior findings with respect to the dissimilari- ties of the branches from the overall branch circulation distribution. Once again, the issue of branch size in allowing for variations in circu- lation patterns needs to be considered. The branch with the greatest similarities in circulation patterns from the other branches was again Flanner House, which had a circulation of only about 8,000 items in the subject categories being considered. Flanner House had by far the highest mean of the dissimilarities to the other branches and the greatest individual dissimilarity. Indeed, if in determining the maximum dissimi- larity of the branches to other branches Flanner House is excluded, the maximum dissimilarity to other branches is substantially lower in virtu- ally every case, as shown in table 6. The presence of the small-circulation Flanner House branch as an outlier leads to the following speculation: some portion of the variation in the circulation patterns among branches is likely due to random varia- tions in the reading interests of library patrons. In the smaller branches, this variation can have a substantial impact on the distribution of circu- lation by subject categories in those branches, substantially increasing the dissimilarities of those branches' circulation patterns from other branches and from the total distribution of circulation for all branches. The prior analyses examined the distribution of circulation across subject categories, focusing on the difference among branches. Alterna- tively, the index of dissimilarity can be used to examine the distribution of circulation across branches, focusing on the differences among sub- ject categories. In this case, the distribution of circulation across the branches in a given subject category is compared with the distribution of the total circulation across the branches. It is a measure of the extent to which any given subject category has a pattern of readership similar to or different from the overall distribution of readership of all items. Table 7 presents the indexes of dissimilarity across branches for the individual subject categories. Once again, the values were relatively small, ranging from less than 5 to nearly 15, with a mean value of 8.03. Westerns and the language and linguistics category showed the highest differences, with index values of almost 13 and 15, respectively. Many other categories had index values in the 4 and 5 range, indicating quite small differences in the distribution of readership across the branches in these categories.

There were some differences in patterns, which varied by both branch and subject category. Somewhat larger differences in circulation patterns were observed between individual
SIMILARITIES IN CIRCULATION PATTERNS 109 branches, but some portions of these larger differences were likely due to variations in circulation patterns across subject categories caused by relatively small numbers of patrons with distinctive reading preferences, especially in the smaller branches. Relationships between Circulation Patterns and Service Area Characteristics While differences in the circulation patterns of the branches from the overall distribution in circulation across subject categories for all of the branches were relatively small, it is still useful to examine the source variation in individual branch circulation patterns. Differences in the overall levels of circulation are strongly related to the social and eco- nomic characteristics of the populations being served, as indicated by both previous literature and the analyses presented above. This section assesses the extent to which the small observed differences in the branch circulation patterns might be associated with such characteristics (as op- posed to resulting from other, perhaps random factors). This section first examines the relationship of social and economic characteristics to overall differences in circulation patterns by compar- ing the circulation patterns of groups of branches with different social and economic characteristics. The next part then focuses on the relationship between branch circulation in individual categories and the social and economic characteristics of the service area populations. Overall Differences in Circulation Patterns The first objective is to determine the extent to which the overall branch circulation patterns differed systematically with the social and economic characteristics of the branch service area populations. The index of dis- similarity proved to be useful in comparing individual branch circula- tion with the overall circulation. In this case, the index of dissimilarity will be used to measure differences in the patterns between groups of branches with different social and economic characteristics. For each of the social and economic variables, the branches are placed into three groups based upon the characteristics of their service area populations-the bottom third on that variable, the middle third, and the top third. Such a division provides for the comparison of groups of branches that fall in the various ranges on each of the variables. The grouping of branches allows the comparison of the total group circulation patterns using the index of dissimilarity. The grouping also serves to minimize the effects of small branch size and the potential impacts of individual patrons which affects individual branches.

As can be seen, major differences exist between the groups. For example, on the variable percentage black, the seven branches in the bottom third had a mean value of less than 2 percent black, while the seven branches in the top third had a mean value of nearly 64 percent. Likewise, the mean household income ranged from less than $14,000 for the poorest third to nearly $27,000-almost twice as much-for the most affluent third. The last three columns of table 8 present the indexes of dissimilarity resulting from a comparison of the circulation patterns of these groups of branches to one another. These indexes of dissimilarity are the com- parisons of the percentage distribution of circulation across subject cate- gories in one group of branches with the distribution for a second group. They can be interpreted as the percentage of the total circulation for one group of branches that would have to be changed to make the distribution identical to the other group of branches. For example, the first entry is for the percent of the population aged eighteen and over and is the index of dissimilarity comparing the distribution of the total circulation for the seven branches in the bottom third with the seven branches in the middle third. The value of 2.70 means that less than 3 percent of the circulation for the group of branches in the bottom third would have to be changed to make the distribution identical to that observed for the middle third. The indexes of dissimilarity are quite small, ranging from a low of 2.70 to the highest value of 9.65.
SIMILARITIES IN CIRCULATION PATTERNS 111 For all but one of the variables, the differences between the bottom and top thirds of the branches were greater than the differences of either of these with the middle third. The greatest values for the indexes of dissimilarity, all above 9, came in comparing the bottom and top thirds of the branches based upon the three measures of socioeconomic status (education, income, and oc- cupation). The racial and age compositions of the service area popula- tions had even smaller influences in causing differences in circulation patterns as reflected in their indexes of dissimilarity. Thus, the characteristics of the service area populations appear to have some relationship to circulation patterns, especially for the educa- tion, income, and occupation variables. However, the differences are not large, showing less dissimilarity than was obtained in comparing individual branch circulation patterns to the total pattern, as was done in the previous section. Differences for Individual Circulation Categories To what extent is the level of circulation in any subject category associ- ated with characteristics of the population in the service area? To exam- ine these relationships, correlation coefficients were calculated between the percent of the total branch circulation in each of the thirty-one subject categories and the five branch service area characteristics. This analysis yields a table of 155 correlation coefficients that would be diffi- cult to interpret and that would include many modest correlations that could have occurred by chance. (If a significance level of .05 were se- lected, one would expect to find about eight significant correlations even if there were no relationships between any of the combinations of sub- ject categories and service area characteristics.) To enable attention to be focused on those relationships that are most likely to be significant, both statistically and substantively, only those correlation coefficients that are significant at the .01 level are reported in table 9. This allows one to more quickly grasp the patterns of significant relationships be- tween circulation by subject category and service area characteristics. The service area characteristic most consistently and strongly associ- ated with differences in circulation patterns was the percentage of the population black, with twelve of the thirty-one correlation coefficients significant at the .01 level. Looking down that column, branch libraries with high percentages of blacks in their service areas had higher circu- lation of language and linguistics, music, mathematics and physics, religion, social sciences, and law, government, and education. These branches had lower circulation in the categories of science fiction, litera- ture 2, natural sciences, agriculture, geography and travel, and history. In contrast, the measures of socioeconomic status-education, in-

114 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY come, and occupation-which are so strongly related to levels of circula- tion, show far less of a relationship to the types of circulation. The socioeconomic status variables for the branch service areas are signifi- cantly correlated (at the .01 level) to circulation levels in only four of the thirty-one categories, with education, income, and occupation showing generally the same patterns. The strongest correlations in the entire table are found between the three measures of socioeconomic status and circulation in the geography and travel category, perhaps sug- gesting that branches with high socioeconomic status service areas circu- late more travel books. Such branches also showed higher circulation of items in the natural sciences, history, and American history. Finally, the percent of the service area population aged eighteen and over was significantly related to circulation in only two categories, geography and travel, and history. It is important to emphasize the degree to which significant relation- ships (at the .01 level) were not found in this analysis. For four of the five service area characteristics-percent eighteen and over, percent with high school education, mean income, and percent white collar-no significant relationships existed between the characteristics of the service area populations and the percentage of the total branch circulation in at least twenty-seven of the thirty-one circulation categories. Branches with very different social characteristics and with very different overall levels of circulation (as shown above) had patrons reading pretty much the same types of books. Only the percentage of the service area popula- tion that is black was related to patterns of circulation on a somewhat more consistent basis. Conclusions Despite dramatic differences in the characteristics of the service area populations and the levels of overall circulation for the various branches, the patterns of circulation across the various categories of adult books are quite similar across the branches. Traditional statistical analyses indicated small differences among branch circulation patterns. The index of dissimilarity showed that only a small percentage of any branch's circulation would have to be changed to make the distribution of circulation across categories identical to the overall pattern. Branches were grouped by demographic characteristics, and the dif- ferences in the circulation patterns between the groups of branches, measured by indexes of dissimilarity, were small. Relationships between population characteristics of the service areas and the percentage of branch circulation in individual categories were examined using correla-
SIMILARITIES IN CIRCULATION PATTERNS 115 tion analysis. The racial composition of the service areas was significantly related to branch circulation in many categories. The other population characteristics were clearly related to circulation levels in only a few circulation categories. Several points need to be made regarding the limitations to the con- clusions that can be drawn from this specific study. First, and obviously, this is a study of differences in circulation patterns across branches in one city, Indianapolis, at one point in time, 1988. Other settings will not necessarily be the same. On the other hand, Indianapolis is a large and heterogeneous metropolitan area, with branches serving very dif- ferent populations, as demonstrated in the analysis. So if great differ- ences in circulation patterns were to be found among branches serving different populations, one would have expected to find such differences here. As mentioned earlier in the discussion of the service areas, these data pose a number of problems. The data are not current, instead coming from the 1980 census. The census tracts constituting the service areas will correspond only imperfectly with the areas in which each branch predominates in providing service, and in any event, branch service areas will overlap to varying degrees. A second limitation is that the analysis examines circulation grouped into the subject categories listed in table 1. The results cannot address the question of whether patrons at different branches are reading the same books or different books within those categories. However, the original circulation data, while not listing individual titles, were more highly disaggregated than the circulation data reported here. Many of the analyses reported in this article were repeated with the original, unaggregated circulation data, and the results were similar to those re- ported here. The question could be raised as to whether the observed similarities in circulation patterns across the branches might reflect similarities in the collections of those branches. Patrons will, of course, be more likely to take out those materials that are available rather than to request materials on interlibrary loan. Also, patrons with different reading in- terests whose needs are not met by a library branch will tend not to use that branch. The selection and acquisition of materials for the library branches in Indianapolis was decentralized, so there were not similari- ties in the collections that had been created by a centralized selection system. To the extent the individual librarians doing the selection and acquisition in the various branches shared similar batckgrounds and training, certain levels of similarity in the collections would be expected and inevitable. It must be emphasized that these findings show the similarity in the
116 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY distribution of books circulated in the branch libraries across the set of subject categories employed in the analysis. It has not addressed the question as to whether patrons at the different branches are reading different or similar books within those subject categories. It is entirely possible, for example, that library users in black neighborhoods are reading books dealing with black history, black literature, and black sociology, while users in predominantly white neighborhoods are read- ing more traditional materials. Questions involving the extent of such differences within the subject categories, and the subject categories within which such differences might occur, would be important issues to be addressed in further research. Also, any conclusion drawn from the findings of the current study should reflect the potential for such differences. Given the surprising similarities in the types of adult books circulated by branch libraries serving very different populations, attention should be directed at the implications for best serving the needs of those pa- trons. Knowledge of branch circulation patterns and their similarities could have important implications for materials selection and materials acquisition budgeting. In selecting materials, perhaps more attention should be given to understanding those common interests and needs and best selecting materials to meet those needs. Placing a greater em- phasis on centralized selection in a multibranch system might represent a more efficient and effective approach to serving those common needs. Centralized selectors would have the responsibility for identifying and acquiring multiple copies of materials of general interest to patrons in all branches. The librarians in the individual branches would focus more specifically on the meeting of any identified deviations from the general pattern, including differences in reading interests within the subject categories. Such an approach could be implemented through the materi- als acquisition budgeting process: the majority of the materials acquisi- tion funds might be allocated to the centralized selection process for meeting the common needs across branches. The remainder of the funds could then be allocated to the branches, to be used by the librari- ans in those branches to acquire other materials to meet the unique needs of patrons of their branches. The findings also hinted that at least some of the differences in circu- lation patterns between branch libraries might be due to the variations in the interests of individual patrons of those branches, rather than to systematic variations in the broader interests of the community using the branches. To the extent that this might be the case, there would be implications for determining the locations of materials to serve these different, more specialized needs. If certain specialized patron interests are distributed rather more randomly, then attempts to identify the
SIMILARITIES IN CIRCULATION PATTERNS 117 branches in which such demand would occur and to enhance collections to meet those needs in specific branches could fail. It might be more effective to develop collections to serve such specialized interests in a centralized location or locations. Patrons with those interests could then either travel to that location or obtain the materials by delivery to their local branches. As the preceding discussions of the possible implications of these findings should make clear, our presenting findings of significant levels of similarity in circulation patterns across branches is certainly not in- tended to suggest that the specific and unique needs of individual pa- trons and communities should be ignored. Increasing emphasis has been placed on the importance of identifying community needs for li- brary services and developing services to respond to those needs, as exemplified by the manual Planning and Role Settingfor Public Libraries (Charles McClure and others [19]). If library patrons from diverse back- grounds show considerable similarities in their reading interests, how- ever, it is important that those common interests also be understood and addressed in library planning and decision making. Perhaps the most general conclusion would be that people who read and borrow books from public libraries seem to share a broad, common set of interests. While the populations served by library branches vary, and while this variation can have a tremendous influence on the levels of reading and circulation, those adults who read select, as a group, pretty much the same types of books, whatever the characteristics of the neighborhoods from which they come.
