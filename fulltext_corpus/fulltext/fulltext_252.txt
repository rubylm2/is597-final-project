CHILDREN AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY1 I. PURPOSE FEBRUARY, 1929, the California Library Association formed a committee of those interested in studies on child psychology related to library work.2 At the first meeting of the committee it was voted that a subcommittee be appointed to work out plans for observing the recreational reading of chil- dren whose reading ages have been determined. Jasmine Brit- ton, librarian of the Los Angeles City School Library, was made chairman of this subcommittee.3 Miss Britton immediately made plans for a preliminary study of the type of children who had recently obtained cards from the various branches. Such a study was carried out with the co-operation of Eva G. Leslie, principal of children's work in the Los Angeles Public Library, and the Psychology and Educa- tional Research Division of the Los Angeles city schools.4 This study took into consideration the intelligence quotient and reading ability of the children; and, while nothing conclu- sive could be deduced from a first study and one so limited in size, it revealed a grouping of intelligence and a level of reading comprehension above normal. The results seemed to indicate that there are large numbers of children in the schools who are slow readers and mentally retarded and who do not use the pub- lic library. As a check on the preliminary study, Miss Britton made ar- rangements for a much more extensive investigation. The pur- pose of the study reported herein is to present facts, as shown 1 This investigation was made by Mr. Alfred S. Lewerenz, statistician of the Los Angeles city schools, at the request of a Committee of Psychologists, School Super- visors, and Librarians appointed by the Sixth District of the California Library Asso- ciation. 2 "The Child and the new psychology," Libraries, XXXV (1930), 117-20. 3 Faith E.

II. METHOD The same people who had helped in the first study took part in the second. Miss Leslie explained to representatives of the fifty library branches the purpose and method to be used. On a given date in the spring of 1930 at each of the libraries through- out the city the names were taken of the first twenty-five chil- dren who drew children's books on children's cards. In addition, the name of the child's school was requested. The information for each child was recorded on a card that is used by the counselors in elementary schools when making educa- tional surveys. The 1,250 cards were then sent by Miss Leslie to the Psychol- ogy and Educational Research Division. Here the cards were sorted by schools and counselor districts. Each counselor was given the cards for pupils belonging in her district. The counselors then proceeded to transfer the following in- formation to the cards: (1) sex, (2) race, (3) actual grade place- ment, (4) chronological age, (5) mental age, (6) intelligence quotient, (7) chronological grade placement, (8) intelligence grade placement, (9) vocabulary grade placement, (10) reading grade placement, (11) reasoning in arithmetic grade placement, (12) fundamentals of arithmetic grade placement, (13) teacher's rating in reading, and (14) teacher's rating in arithmetic. If a survey had been given recently, the information was used; otherwise new tests were given. All mental ages and men- tal grade placements were brought up to date by multiplying the intelligence quotient by the new chronological age. Subject grade placements were also all made as of June, 1930. At the close of the school year in June the counselors returned the cards to the Psychology and Educational Research Division, where each was checked. The cards were then given to Miss E. Alice McAnulty, in charge of the statistical section of the Divi- sion, who summarized the statistical data.
THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY 44 III. RESULTS In summarizing data, comparisons with the previous study and with contrasting information should serve to clarify the meaning of the figures obtained. A. Number of cases. - Each of the fifty branch libraries made out cards for 25 children drawing children's books on a given date, making the total possible number of cases 1,250. When the cards finally came in from the school counselors, the total had been reduced by 88, leaving 1,162 cases. Of this number, about 82 per cent were usable in the statistical study. Of the incomplete returns, counselors reported that about 15 per cent of the children had moved, had been promoted to an- TABLE I Number of Cases No. Percentage Classification Public school with data 81.8 951 Public school without data 15-4 179 Parochial school without data 29 Military and other schools without data Â°-3 3 1,162 100. 0 other school, were out sick, or had died. Approximately 2.5 per cent of the cases came from parochial schools. It was not possi- ble to secure the necessary data for these children. The figures are as given in Table I. While some data were supplied on 951 of the cases, the full number was not accounted for on any one item. The totals ranged all the way from 925, for actual grade placement, down to 490, for reasoning in arithmetic. B. Number of schools served by library branches. - In this sam- pling of a typical day the number of schools being served by a branch ranged from one to fourteen. The median number of schools served by a branch was five. In many cases pupils seem to prefer a distant branch to the one near the school. Table II shows the distribution of schools served. This table should be
CHILDREN AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY 45 read as follows: two branches served fourteen schools; one branch, eleven schools; two, ten schools; two, nine schools; etc. Approximately 174 different public schools are included in the distribution. This fact indicates that the cases represent a fair sampling of the entire city. C. Intelligence level of the schools represented. - For many schools there is available the average I.Q. of the entire popula- tion. The intelligence level of schools was compared with the number of children each school had among the library patrons.

For example, not a single child was reported as coming from any one of the twelve development centers attended by more than seventeen hundred subnormal children whose average I.Q. is approximately 63. * The schools were ranked according to the number of children each contributed to the study. It was found which schools had sent no pupils, which schools sent 1 pupil each, 2 pupils each, 3 pupils each, etc. The largest number of pupils coming from any one school was 27. From schools for which intelligence data were available, three groups of ten schools each were selected. The intelligence level of a school was determined by averaging 1 M.

156 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY the I.Q.'s of its pupils. The first group consisted of ten schools reporting no pupils; the second, of ten schools which had each reported one pupil; and the third, of the ten schools that had sent the most pupils. This last group, on the average, had been represented by 21 pupils each. The average I.Q. of the ten schools in each of the three groups was then found as shown in Table III. The median city-wide I.Q. is approximately ioo.1 It will be seen that schools not con- tributing library-users have a population distinctly below aver- age; while schools sending the most pupils were, on the average, well above median intelligence. TABLE III Average I.Q. of Schools Contributing Most and Fewest Pupils Average Library Attendance Average I.Q. 0 pupils 90 . 3 1 pupil 100.4 21 pupils 105.0 The schools contributing pupils to the study were studied also from another angle. Instead of distributing the schools by the number of children represented by each, the schools were segregated by I.Q. level. Thus, all schools with an average I.Q. between 115 and 119 were put in one group; those with an I.Q. between no and 114 in another; and so on down. Then the average number of pupils contributed by each of these I.Q. groups was found. Table IV gives the figures; and, at the right of the table, a graph shows the pupil averages to the nearest whole number. Table IV does not include all the schools covered by the study, as average I.Q. levels are not available in all cases. The sampling, however, seems sufficiently large (246 schools) to war- rant consideration of the trend indicated in the graph at the right of the table. It will be noted that, as the I.Q.'s of the schools decrease, the number of pupils contributed decreases 1 Willis W. Clark, "Differences in accomplishment in schools of varying average I.Q.," Los Angeles educational research bulletin, VI (1927), 13-16.
CHILDREN AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY J57 also. This fact is significant in the light of the information con- cerning the pupils themselves which appears later in this report. As pointed out earlier, the average I.Q. for the city is ioo. However, it will be noted that the most pupils in any one group come from schools with an average I.Q. between 105 and 109. The median pupil also comes from this group. The facts presented in Tables III and IV may be attributed to either one or both of two causes: (1) the public library may not have branches which serve sections of the city inhabited by TABLE IV Average Number of Pupils Coming to Libraries, by I.Q.

In the light of additional in- formation in this and other studies/ it would seem that the second cause is probably the more important, though un- doubtedly both contribute to the tendency noted. The data so far have concerned schools and branch libraries as units. The following data are based upon the child as the unit, and the figures represent information secured by the ele- mentary-school counselors. Mention has been made of the preliminary study which was based on 94 cases.2 The technique used in both studies was 1 Reported later. 2 See footnote 4, p. 152.
THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY 158 much the same. The main difference was that in the first in- stance children were those registering to become members while in the second the cases were children actually drawing children's books. The latter method serves better to select children who are actual patrons of the library. The two criteria, however, are probably sufficiently similar to permit the comparison of both groups on similar items. D. Number of pupils by grades. - There were 925 cases for which the actual grade placement of the child was known. TABLE V Number of Pupils Drawing Books, According to Their Grade in School No. of Pupils Grade Percentage I 8 0.9 II 48 5-2 Ill 14.5 134 IV 176 19.0 V 21 .6 200 VI 23.1 214 VII 8.0 74 VIII 4.8 44 IX 2.7 4 X O.I I XI 0 0.0 XII 0. 1 I Total 925 100. 0 While the original plan was to base the study on elementary schools alone, actually there were children secured in the sam- pling from the first through the twelfth grades. No special sig- nificance can be attached to the figures given in the lower part of Table V, since these children came to the section of the li- brary intended for younger children. However, it is interesting to note that the children's section appeals most to pupils in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades, with the largest percentage of children, 23.1 per cent, occurring in the sixth grade. The median child was found to be a beginning V A pupil. By the time chil- dren reach the third grade they are beginning to use the library in relatively large numbers.
CHILDREN AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY 49 Relatively few children come to the children's section after they have passed the eighth grade; in fact, there is a big falling- off after the sixth grade, when many of the pupils are transferred to junior high school. This decrease is explained in part by the use of junior high school libraries and the adult section of the public library. In the preliminary study the main difference was noticed in the third grade. Of the children sampled at that time, third- TABLE VI Percentage of Boys and Girls Using Libraries, by Grades Totals for Boys and Girls Separately Girls Difference Boys Grade (Per Cent) (Per Cent) (Per Cent) I O.8 O.2 I .O II 5-1 5-3 O.2 O.6 III .... 14.8 I4.2 IV 18.2 -J-5 19.7 20.6 v -1.8 22.4 -3-6 VI 24.8 21 .2 VII 2.2 7.O 9.2 6-3 VIII 2.8 3-5 IX 2-3 3-2 0.9 X -0.2 0.2 0 0 XI 0.0 0.0 0.0 XII 0.2 0.2 0.0 Total 0.0 100. 0 100. 0 graders most frequently applied for membership. Otherwise the tendencies were the same, including the large number of sixth- graders. The figures indicate that nearly two-thirds of the read- ers are included in grades IV, V, and VI. E. Sex by grades. - More girls than boys drew books from the children's section: there were 513 girls and 412 boys. This means that there were only about 80 per cent as many boys drawing books as there were giHs. This is almost exactly the same ratio found for boys and girls applying for membership in the preliminary study. The distributions in Table VI are given in percentages for purposes of comparison. Table VI reduces both groups to a common denominator and
1 60 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY is useful in comparing the number of boy and girl patrons, as- suming equal populations. It will be noted that the girls in the first, second, and third grades do not come to the library quite as much as the boys, there being a difference of about 1 per cent. However, in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades the girls read relatively more than the boys. Here the difference in favor of the girls amounts to nearly 7 per cent. The biggest difference in the patronage of TABLE VII Ratio of Boys and Girls by Grades, Using Total for Boys and Girls Together as a Base Girls Boys Difference Grade (Per Cent) (Per Cent) (Per Cent) I O.O 0.4 O.4 II 2.8 2.4 -O.4 Ill 6.6 -!-3 7-9 IV -2.8 8.1 10.9 V 12.5 -3-3 9.2 VI 9-4 -4.4 VII 0.2 3 9 4.1 VIII . 2.8 l-9 0.9 IX i-3 1.4 O.I X -0.1 O.I 0.0 XI 0.0 0.0 0.0 XII O.I 0. 1 0.0 Total 55-5 44-5 - 11 .0 boys and girls in the children's section seems to come in the sixth grade. In actual number of cases there were only 69 per cent as many boys drawing books as there were girls. Then, in Grade VII and above, the boys draw relatively more children's books, as shown by an approximately 6 per cent difference. This fact is consistent with the facts concerning the earlier adoles- cence of girls. The column at the right shows the difference in percentage for each grade, using the percentage for girls as a basis. To help explain the foregoing tendencies, the data are pre- sented in another form (Table VII). This time the boys and girls in each grade are given in percentages of the total for both
CHILDREN AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY 161 boys and girls. The other table gave the percentage of boys in each grade for the total number of boys and the same for the girls. It will be seen that, of the combined total for both boys and girls, the former amounted to 44.5 per cent and the latter to 55.5 per cent. The same estimate for the preliminary study was also found, and is given in Table VIII for comparison. Both studies yielded approximately the same preponderance of girl readers. Table VII permits a comparison of boys and girls in the vari- ous grades by actual numbers. It will be observed that in the first grade each sex is represented by 0.4 per cent. From Grade TABLE VIII Percentage of Boys and Girls of Total for Preliminary and Follow-Up Studies Girls Boys Total Study (Per Cent) (Per Cent) (Per Cent) Preliminary 45-7 54-3 IOO. Ð Follow-up 55-5 44-5 IOO. Ð II through Grade VI there is a steady increase in numbers. Then there is a decided dropping-off in the number of girls in the children's section. Thus, while in all there were only about 80 per cent as many boys as girls drawing books, the boys were approximately as numerous as the girls in all grades but II to VI. Tables VI and VII seem to indicate, with respect to the chil- dren included in this study, that: (1) girls are more inclined to draw books from the library than are boys; (2) girls display a faster development in reading interest than do boys; (3) both boys and girls reach the peak of their reading of children's books in the sixth grade; and (4) girls show a faster decrease in the reading of children's books after the sixth grade. F. Racial groups represented.- Many pupils of foreign extrac- tion were included in the study. Data as to race were given on 870 cards, and Table IX shows the distribution of races in terms
162 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY of percentage of that total. The second column shows the per- centages according to the census cards tabulated during the registration of minors in Los Angeles in October, 1927.1 The percentage of minors probably is the best available estimate of the proportions of each racial group in our schools. The third column to the right shows how the racial groups in the library study differed from the numbers revealed during the registration of minors. The largest difference is that of the Mex- icans, who are represented at the library by but a little more than a third of their actual proportion. The Japanese, on the TABLE IX Racial Groups in Terms of Percentage of Total Library Study Registration of Minors Difference Race (Per Cent) (Per Cent) (Per Cent) White ... 86.Ð 80.8 5-2 Japanese !-9 3-O 4-9 Mexican -8.1 13.O 4.9 Negro ... . 0.2 2.7 2-5 Chinese O.2 0.3 - O.I Other. r-3 0.4 0.9 Total 100.0 IOO. 0 0.0 other hand, had half again as many representatives as their ac- tual proportion would predict. There were slightly more ne- groes than might have been anticipated by the census figures. Lastly, the white library patrons formed a 5 per cent larger group than they do in the schools. These facts may be inter- preted to mean: (1) branch libraries may be placed where they favor white, Japanese, and negro children to the detriment of Mexican children; or (2) children of white, Japanese, and negro stock have a greater interest in reading materials supplied by branch libraries than do children of Mexican parentage; or (3) a combination of items 1 and 2. G. Chronological grade placement. - There were 919 cases for which both actual grade and chronological grade placements 1 H. A. Whiteneck, "Registration of minors," Los Angeles educational research bulletin,â¢ (1928), 15-16.
CHILDREN AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY 163 were recorded. Table X gives the average chronological grade placement for the children in each grade. The center column gives the norm for each grade, while the right-hand column shows the deviation from the norm in tenths of a school year, i.e., o. 1 = one month, 0.2 = 1 months, etc. Only the grades represented by 25 or more cases are shown, since a smaller number does not yield a sufficiently reliable average. This elimination removes 9 cases, making the total for the table 910.1 TABLE X Average Chronological Grade Placement by Actual Grade Deviation from Norm Grade Average Norm (Years) II 2.6 2.5 - O.I Ill 3-6 O.O 4.6 4.6 IV O.O V 5-6 5-4 -O.2 VI 6.6 f>3 -Â°-3 7.6 VII 7.2 -0.4 VIII 8.6 7-9 -0.7 8.6 IX . 9.6 - 1 .0 Weighted average for all grad -0.24 es The children secured in the sampling were, on the average, nearly two and a half months younger than expectation. This means that these cases were accelerated in comparison to the usual run of students. In the second grade the children were one month under age. In the third and fourth grade the library study pupils were just at norm. Beginning with the fifth grade, the pupils gradually become more and more accelerated. Though grades above the ninth were eliminated, because of fewness of numbers, this in- crease in the deviations continues. It begins to be apparent that the students going to the chil- dren's section of the library are not quite the same as the gen- 1 The number of pupils per grade in this and the two following tables approximates that given in Table V.
164 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY eral mass of school population. From Grade V and up they are considerably younger than their schoolmates. The fol- lowing tables will help to explain the reason for this difference in ages. H. Mental grade placement. - Mental grade placements and actual grade placements were given on 897 cards. However, as in the previous tables, grades were eliminated where there were less than 25 pupils represented. In this case the total was re- duced to 889.' In Table XI, as in Table X, the norm for the grade is given and likewise the deviations from this norm in terms of tenths of a school year.

This difference in intelligence level has a tendency to increase as the children grow older. The small- est difference in a grade was four months, while the largest was one year. One reason why library patrons are able to compete in school with older pupils is apparently that they are mentally more ma- ture. On the average, the library pupils are six months older in mental age. I. Intelligence-quotient distribution. - The ratio between men- tal maturity and chronological age is expressed by the intelli- gence quotient. On the average, the I.Q. of the school children of Los Angeles is approximately 100. The I.Q. distribution of the
CHILDREN AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY i65 children in the library study was distinctly above normal, the average being 108. This figure is even higher than the average found for the preliminary study, which was 106. Table XII in- dicates the common tendency for children in the upper grades to show higher I.Q.'s than those in the lower grades. Thus the lowest average, 105, is found in the fourth grade, while the high- est average, 117, is found in the ninth grade. This average I.Q. is exceeded by only 10 per cent of the city schools, and is not reached by 90 per cent.1 TABLE XII Intelligence of Library Readers by Grades Average I.Q. Grade Average I.Q.

A second distribution of intelligence quotients was made by 10-point intervals of I.Q. This permits a more detailed study of the group as a whole. The material is given in Table XIII. Ad- jacent to the data for the library study are given the figures for the city schools as a whole.2 In the right-hand column are given the deviations of the library study percentages from those found for the city. While Table XIII lends support to the idea that pupils above the average in intelligence tend to go to the library, correlations show that there is not a high relationship between intelligence and library attendance. The foregoing tables reveal that the library patrons had among their number fewer pupils with an I.Q. below 109 than 1 Willis W. Clark, "Differences in accomplishment in schools of varying average I.Q," Los Angeles educational research bulletin, VI (1927), 13-16. 2 Ellen A.

1 66 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY is usual in the schools, while there were more than usual with I.Q/sno or above. It will be observed that there are only one-thirteenth as many- pupils in the library study with I.Q. below 70 as are in school. On the other hand, there are more than three times as many library cases of I.Q. 140 and above than in the typical school population.

On the other hand, the bright children went there in numbers exceeding their actual proportion to the school population. The following five sections deal with results gained from standardized tests in vocabulary, reading comprehension, arith- metic reasoning, and arithmetic fundamentals. This material is presented by grades in comparison to norm. In addition, at the bottom of each table is given the average amount the group is above or below norm, and also the same figure for children in schools throughout the city of approximately the same intelli- gence. The latter figures are based on data from more than 100 schools where the average I.Q. is approximately 105.1 The latter averages, of course, are higher than those for the entire city. 1 Willis W. Clark, "Elementary school surveys with standardized tests, 1 928-1 929," Third yearbook^ Psychology and Educational Research Division, Los Angeles City School District (1929), pp. 9-22.
CHILDREN AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY I67 As in previous tables, no averages for a grade are given unless represented by 25 or more cases. J. Vocabulary grade placements by grades. - Vocabulary grade placements are available for 709 cases, of which 680 cases are represented in Table XIV. In knowledge of words the library study children were not only more than five months above norm but they were also more than four months above the accomplishment of a nearly comparable group made up of the children of 100 schools with TABLE XIV Vocabulary Knowledge by Grades Deviation from Norm Average Norm Grade (Years) 2.6 II 31 o-5 3-6 Ill 3-9 Â°-3 4.6 IV 5-1 Â°-5 5.6 6.1 0.6 V 6.6 VI 0.8 7-4 7.6 0.6 VII 8.2 8.6 VIII 8-3 0.2 Weighted average for all grades. . 0.54 Average for nearly similar pupils. 0.13 an average I.Q. of 105. In fact, the library study pupils were among the highest 15 per cent of the 100 schools in vocabulary achievement. While the data for the two groups are not exactly similar, they are sufficiently alike to suggest that the library readers excel other children of about the same mental level in a knowl- edge of words. K. Reading-comprehension grade placements, - Tests in ability to gather meaning from the printed page were available for 851 children. Because of small numbers in certain grades, only 816 cases are represented in Table XV. At the bottom of this table is a comparison from a study made in 1926.1 The reading-comprehension level of library study pupils was 1 Willis W. Clark, "Differences in accomplishment in schools of varying average I.Q," Los Angeles educational research bulletin, VI (1927), 13-16.
168 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY almost half a school year above norm. Likewise, they were farther advanced in reading than were pupils of about the same mental ability. It would seem that either good readers go to the library or the library makes good readers. However, since we have seen selection going on in the matter of age and intelli- gence, it may be safe to assume that selection also plays a large part in the matter of reading accomplishment. Children who are not good readers probably have a tendency to shun the li- brary.

Fundamentals of arithmetic grade placements, - The test in fundamentals of arithmetic is used to find out how much a child knows about the essential facts of addition, subtraction, multi- plication, and division. Records were available for 524 cases, of which 490 are represented in Table XVI. As in reading comprehension, the library study pupils were more than four months above norm in ability to solve arith- metic problems. They were also about two months higher than were the pupils in comparable groups. M. Reasoning in arithmetic grade placements. - The test in reasoning in arithmetic is a combination of the ability to read and to solve problems. Grade placements were received for 618 cases. Table XVII is based on 604 cases. For the first and only time the library study pupils are below
CHILDREN AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY 169 norm. They are approximately two and a half months below norm in reasoning in arithmetic. However, the comparable group is still farther down, as the children in it are more than three months retarded.

An estimate places the amount of retardation at 0.4 of a year, or about four school months. The library cases were but 0.25 of a year retarded, a difference of a month and a half. The last of four sections have dealt with measures of subject achievement based on objective tests. As a check on these meas-
THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY 170 ures, teachers' judgment was also utilized. Counselors had teachers rate pupils in reading and arithmetic. They were classi- fied as being "Good/' "Fair," or "Poor." Summaries were made of these data which have been contrasted with similar data taken from cards of unselected children in typical schools. Li- brary facilities were available for these typical children in the control group. In one case there is a branch just across the street. N. Teachers' ratings on reading. - Table XVIII presents the ratings on reading given by teachers to pupils of the library study and to unselected pupils in typical schools. The percent- ages are based on 565 library cases and 815 typical cases.

Ð 100.0 0,0 It will be seen that there were almost once again as many Good readers among the library cases as there were in the un- selected group, according to teachers' estimates. Likewise, the library patrons were noticeably fewer who received ratings of Fair and Poor. O. Teachers' ratings on arithmetic. - Ratings on arithmetic were turned in for 240 cases, and these have been contrasted with 823 cases of unselected ratings (Table XIX). According to the teachers' ratings, the library cases turn out to be considerably better in arithmetic than are unselected cases. There are half again as many library children who were marked Good as compared with typical cases. On the other hand, only half as many library cases were marked Poor in arithmetic.

These cards were checked with records of past surveys.

The children are accelerated chronologically, are superior mentally, and are above norm in all their academic subjects except reasoning in arithmetic. In this last subject they are still above the standard set by the city as a whole.
172 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY IV. CONCLUSIONS A study has been made of the type of child that draws chil- dren's books from the branches of the Los Angeles Public Li- brary. In all, there were 1,162 cases for which there was some information. Objective test data for intelligence and scholastic achievement were secured for 951 children. A summary of this information yields the following conclusions: A. Of the readers sampled, 97.2 per cent were children from the public schools, 2.5 per cent were from parochial schools, and 0.3 per cent were from military or other private schools. B. There was considerable variation in the number of schools served by library branches. Two branches had patrons coming from as many as fourteen different schools, while there were three branches that each had pupils coming from one school. The median number of schools served by a branch was five. C. There was a noticeable relationship between the intelli- gence level of a school and the number of pupils contributed. Ten schools that had no children represented had an average I.Q. of 90.3; ten schools that sent 1 pupil each averaged 100.4 I.Q.; and ten schools that averaged 21 pupils each had an aver- age I.Q. of 105. Not a single child was reported as coming from any of the twelve development centers for subnormal children. D. There was likewise a noticeable relationship between the average I.Q. of schools and the number of pupils patronizing the libraries. Schools with an average I.Q. of 1 15-19 averaged 9 patrons each. The number of pupils decreased until schools with I.Q. 84 and below averaged less than 1 pupil each. The median number of pupils came from schools with an I.Q. average of 105-9. The average I.Q. for the city is approximately 100. E. There is a gradual increase in the drawing of children's books until the sixth grade, after which there is a rapid falling- off in patrons. Nearly two-thirds of the readers were included in grades IV, V, and VI. F. There were only about 80 per cent as many boys drawing books as there were girls. G. Girls displayed a faster development in reading interest than did boys.
CHILDREN AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY 173 H. Both boys and girls reached the peak of their reading of children's books in the sixth grade. I. Girls evidenced a faster decrease in the reading of chil- dren's books after the sixth grade. J. In comparison to the general school population, whites, Japanese, and negroes read children's books above expectation. There was but one-third as many Mexicans represented as their actual population warranted. K. The library cases were, on the average, nearly two and a half months younger than expectation. Beginning with the fifth grade, the children gradually became more and more accelerated chronologically. L. The library patrons, on the average, were six months older mentally than is normal for their grade. This difference in in- telligence level has a tendency to increase as the upper grades are reached. M. The average intelligence quotient for the library cases was found to be 108. The average I.Q. for the city is approxi- mately 100. There is a tendency for the children coming from the higher grades to be the brighter also. N. While the library seemed to draw children from among the more intelligent groups, there is not a high correlation between I.Q. and library attendance. O. Library children were more than half a school year above norm in their knowledge of words, as measured by a standard- ized sentence vocabulary test. P. Library children were nearly half a school year above norm in their ability to read and understand printed material, as measured by a standardized test in reading comprehension. Q. Library patrons as a group were more than four school months above norm in their ability to add, subtract, multiply, and divide, as measured by a standardized test in fundamentals of arithmetic. R. The library cases were two and a half school months below norm in reasoning in arithmetic. They were, however, above the average for the city, as the schools as a whole are estimated as being four months retarded in this subject.
174 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY S. In comparing the library cases with unselected children of about the same mentality, they were in all cases doing better work. It would seem that library patrons have an added in- terest in their school work not found in children even of approxi- mate mentality. T. Using teachers' judgments for library cases and typical children, the ratings indicated that there were almost once again as many Good readers among the library cases as there were in the unselected group. U. According to the teacher's ratings, there were half again as many library children who were marked Good in arithmetic as compared with ordinary cases. On the other hand, only half as many library cases were marked Poor in arithmetic. V. A summary of data available for a few cases secured in surveys a year or more ago indicate at the time that library patrons were accelerated chronologically, were superior mental- ly, and were above norm in all their academic subjects except reasoning in arithmetic. In this last subject they were still above the standard set by the city as a whole. v. summary Briefly this study indicates: 1. Children who draw children's books are, more often than not, of a superior type, mentally and scholastically. 2. Many children of subnormal mentality do not make use of the children's section of the public library. Alfred S. Lewerenz Los Angeles City Schools
