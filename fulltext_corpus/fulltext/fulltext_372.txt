Introduction The continued underrepresentation of ethnic minorities in the LIS (library and information science) field has raised concerns among LIS educators and professionals for decades [1, 2]. Statistics have consistently shown that the student population in LIS schools/programs is less diverse than the U.S. population. While 73.6 percent of the students enrolled in ALA (American Library Association) accredited LIS programs are white, only 11.3 percent are students of color from the four main ethnic minority groups (African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, and Native American) [3]. The proportion of students of color in LIS schools (11.3 percent) is significantly lower than the proportion of those enrolled in all U.S. master’s programs (26.4 percent) [4] and much lower than the proportion of ethnic minorities in the U.S. population (31.3 percent) [5]. Such underrepresentation is also evident in libraries. An ALA report indicates that librarians of color constitute about 12–12.5 percent of the academic and public librarian population [6]. More recently, it has been reported that the ratio of librarians of color in the credentialed librarian population has actually dropped to 10 percent in 2000 from 12 percent in 1990 [7]. With the closing of the LIS School at Clark Atlanta University—a historically black university—in 2005, there have been growing concerns that recruiting minorities into the LIS field would become even more difficult. Other professional fields also face the same challenge—underrepresentation of ethnic minorities in their profession. In social work, journalism, and nursing, minorities constitute around 12 percent of their professional population [8–10]. Such fields have made great efforts to recruit more minorities into their professions, and some have been fairly successful. For example, the ratio of ethnic minorities in the elementary and secondary school teacher population has risen to 15 percent in 2000 from 12.2 percent in 1997 [11]. The U.S. census projections indicate that, by 2050, the four ethnic minority groups will represent almost half of the U.S. population [12]. Unless a comprehensive and competitive plan for recruiting/retaining ethnic minorities is implemented, the LIS field will fall behind other fields, and the gap between LIS and U.S. populations will widen even further. The librarian population will not reflect the users in the communities that they serve [13]. One of the most important ways to minimize such a gap would be to implement more effective programs to recruit/retain students of color in LIS schools. It has long been recognized that attracting diverse students into LIS programs is key to producing a diverse workforce in librarianship [14]. Nevertheless, recruitment/retention in LIS schools has received much less attention than recruitment/retention in libraries. This study is an effort to identify effective strategies for recruiting and retaining students of color in LIS education programs. A nationwide, Web‐based survey was conducted to examine how librarians of color evaluate the minority recruitment/retention efforts that LIS schools and associations have made and what recruitment/retention strategies the librarians consider effective. The study tried to identify effective strategies from the perspective of librarians of color, as the librarians were actually the target of such recruitment and retention endeavors. Importance of Ethnic Diversity and Need for Diversity in Professions The benefits of ethnic diversity in the LIS field are multifold: it benefits library users, library organizations, and LIS programs. To users, having authority figures who look like them in libraries is important, as it can make the users feel more comfortable and affirmed that they are in the right place. Studies suggest that interpersonal similarity increases ease of communication, fosters relationships of trust and reciprocity, and helps establish a sense of belonging and membership [15, 16]. Ethnicity, one of the key factors determining interpersonal similarities, contributes to cultural as well as physical similarities. In a library with an ethnically diverse workforce, all the users, regardless of their ethnic and cultural background, will be able to find someone whom they can relate to and get services relevant to their needs and preferences. With a better understanding of cultural values, languages, and information needs of the minority community, librarians of color can provide effective reference [17], information literacy [18], and collection management services [19] and also reach out to diverse users [19–21]. As Mark Winston [22, 23] accurately pointed out, diversity in libraries is important not only for the provision of better information services but also for the better performance and success of libraries. A number of studies suggest that companies that are diverse in minority employment and other aspects tend to perform better and be more successful than others [24, 25]. Diversity in librarianship should be one of the key factors affecting the success of libraries, as a positive relationship exists between the level of diversity and organizational performance. Ethnic diversity also brings benefits to schools, improving the quality of learning [26, 27]. Researchers have found that diversity in higher education can foster intellectual development [28], reduce students’ level of racial prejudice [29], and facilitate students’ explorations of diverse perspectives [30]. Overall, ethnic diversity is beneficial as it enriches a society by offering all citizens, including students, more opportunities to experience, learn, and understand one another. Efforts to Improve Ethnic Diversity Recognizing the benefits of and the needs for a diverse workforce in librarianship, many LIS‐related organizations have worked diligently to recruit people of color into the professions over the last few decades. ALA, for example, created the Spectrum Initiative in 1997, in order to promote diversity in the library community and recruit minority librarians by providing scholarships, mentoring, and training programs. A number of LIS schools as well as libraries have shown their support of the Spectrum Initiative scholarship program by matching or supplementing the grants [31]. The ARL (Association of Research Libraries), another prominent professional association, sponsors the Leadership and Career Development Program for minority librarians who have demonstrated leadership in research libraries. It also launched the Initiative to Recruit a Diverse Workforce to recruit LIS graduate students of color to ARL libraries upon graduation [32]. Other associations, including the Medical Library Association, the Special Library Association, the Library Administration and Management Association, and the Library and Information Technology Association, also provide similar support. LIS schools also have made an effort to increase the number of students of color through scholarships, grant‐supported recruitment programs, regional recruitment projects, and curriculum reform [33–35]. Especially with support from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, an increasing number of LIS schools offer recruitment programs often accompanied by scholarships and special programs. Knowledge River at the University of Arizona [36], PRISM at the University of Rhode Island, and PRAXIS (Practice, Reflection, Advocacy, Excellence, Inquiry, Solutions) at the University of California, Los Angeles, are some examples. Many academic libraries also offer residency, internship, and fellowship programs for recruiting underrepresented groups in the LIS field. Such programs have been well received, and an increasing number of libraries provide similar opportunities [37]. Despite such endeavors, however, the progress in recruiting students of color in LIS has been rather slow. Empirical research might help identify effective recruitment and retention strategies and develop more efficient and systematic recruitment and retention programs. Investigating approaches used in other professional fields might also offer some insight on successful strategies. Precollege bridge programs used for recruiting minorities in engineering and nursing [38–40]; partnerships among research universities, colleges, and community colleges used for developing systematic recruitment programs in psychology [41, 42]; and early intervention programs and nationwide campaigns used for improving the public’s image of the professions in nursing and other health care fields [43, 44] are some examples. For a successful recruitment and retention of minorities, the LIS field will need to be vigilant in researching and implementing effective strategies. Research on Recruitment and Retention Effective recruitment/retention programs cannot be developed without the support of research. A review of the related literature in LIS has revealed that a majority of recruitment research focuses on the factors affecting individuals’ decisions to enter the LIS profession. Examples of such research include Kathleen Heim and William Moen’s study on occupational entry [45], Lois Buttlar and William Caynon’s survey of librarians of color [46], and Winston’s recruitment theory research [47]. These studies identified factors and people with a strong impact on a person’s decision to enter the LIS field. Some of the influential factors include the intellectual and service‐oriented characteristics of librarianship, role models (e.g., librarians and teachers), previous library work experience, and availability of financial aid [23, 45, 46, 48, 49]. Other studies focus on barriers to the minority recruitment in LIS. Some of the identified obstacles are related to the library profession itself. For example, low salary of librarians is a barrier working against recruiting potential students to the LIS field. Statistics show that professional fields with higher salary levels (e.g., lawyers and engineers) are more successful in recruiting minorities: 20–25 percent of legal and engineering student populations are ethnic minorities [50, 51]. The negative image of librarians is another obstacle related to the profession [49]. Other barriers include racism [52] and a lack of diversity in LIS programs and libraries [53]. Another group of studies focuses on strategies for effective recruitment and retention. The strategies and related studies are presented in table 1. The first seven strategies would be effective for both recruitment and retention. Collaboration with libraries, for example, can be an effective recruitment strategy. In a number of existing studies, most of the LIS students or librarians of color reported that they had previous library work experience before pursuing LIS studies and that librarians influenced them to choose the LIS field [45, 46, 65]. Libraries provide an important pool of prospective LIS students, and librarians could be great role models and recruiters. Working with libraries would also be a part of retention efforts, as the librarians can help incorporate diversity in curriculum (e.g., through their participation in LIS education as guest speakers or lecturers and as supervisors or collaborators for fieldwork and internship) and also mentor current students. Creative delivery of classes would be another effective strategy for both recruitment and retention. It can be realized in different ways, including flexible class times (e.g., evening and weekend courses) and distance education options. Such options can help students keep their jobs to support their studies financially.

Targeted recruitment is related to the use of strategies effective to a particular ethnic minority group, which requires a good understanding of the group. Strategies of this kind may include advertising in ethnic yellow pages, recruiting trips to historically black institutions, bilingual advising, and so on [56]. Incorporating diversity in curriculum and offering internship/fieldwork opportunities in ethnic minority communities would be important for retaining students of color. To effectively incorporate diversity in teaching, scenarios or case studies on diversity issues can be used in most classes [66], and ethnic minority guest speakers or lecturers can be invited [35]. Having students work in diverse communities and serve diverse users through fieldwork, internships, or practicums would be another excellent strategy to help all LIS students appreciate the importance of diversity. After understanding influential factors and strategies for recruitment and retention, an important step to follow would be to assess the effectiveness of strategies. As recruitment/retention efforts take resources that are usually limited, it is essential to identify more effective strategies and allocate resources accordingly. Empirical research is instrumental in identifying the more effective strategies from an array of potential strategies. Buttlar and Caynon’s study in 1992 is one of the few empirical studies that touched upon the issue of recruiting strategies in LIS. Librarians of color participated in the study, and the study findings helped identify effective recruitment strategies. The LIS field and society have undergone significant changes since the study over a decade ago. The present study seeks to understand current views of librarians of color with regard to effective strategies for recruiting and retaining students of color in LIS programs. Study The goal of the study was twofold: (1) to assess the efforts that LIS schools and associations have made to recruit and retain students of color and (2) to identify effective recruitment/retention strategies, which will help develop efficient recruitment/retention programs. The study also aimed at revealing any differences among different ethnic minority groups in terms of recruitment and retention strategies they consider effective. Participants The study participants were librarians of color who graduated from an ALA‐accredited LIS program or are currently enrolled in such a program. Because these individuals were the target of the recruitment/retention efforts of LIS schools and associations, their experiences and suggestions regarding minority recruitment/retention would provide valuable information on the strategies that will work effectively. The selection of this population was also guided by the recruitment theory, as elaborated by Winston. The premise of this theory is that there are similarities between those who are currently in a field or profession and those who are likely to enter it [23]. A study of librarians of color—former students in LIS programs—would provide insights into characteristics and preferences of the prospective students of color in LIS programs as the two groups must be similar, according to the recruitment theory. A total of 182 librarians of color participated in the study. About 85 percent ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=155$ \end{document} ) of the participants had already graduated from an LIS program, while the rest were currently enrolled in such a program.

Hispanics, Asian Americans, and American Indians constituted 28 percent, 23 percent, and 10 percent of the participants, respectively.4 For their current job, most of the participants were working in academic libraries (42.3 percent; \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=77$ \end{document} ), and 26.8 percent ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=49$ \end{document} ) were working in public libraries.

Regarding their language skills, 41 percent of the participants were bilingual or multilingual. 4.  Because multiple responses were allowed for the question on ethnic background, the percentages add up to more than 100 percent. Survey Instrument The questionnaire used in the study was developed based on recruitment and career decision literature in LIS and other fields and also based on input from ten members of an advisory board consisting of LIS faculty and practitioners of color. The instrument was pretested with five practitioners. The final version of the questionnaire consisted of thirty‐two questions regarding participants’ demographic and educational background, their perception of recruitment/retention efforts and strategies, and factors affecting their career decisions. Open‐ended questions were also included to allow the participants to share their experience and suggestions on important strategies, factors, and other issues related to the recruitment/retention of students of color. Data Collection and Analysis A Web‐based questionnaire was used to collect data for this study. A call for participation was posted on mailing lists of the five ALA‐affiliated associations: (1) the American Indian Library Association (http://aila.library.sd.gov/), (2) Asian/Pacific American Librarians Association (http://www.apalaweb.org/), (3) Black Caucus of the American Library Association (http://www.bcala.org/), (4) Chinese American Librarians Association (http://www.cala‐web.org/), and (5) Reforma: The National Association to Promote Library and Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish Speaking (http://www.reforma.org/). The e‐mail announcement provided the members with a brief description of the study, along with the link to the Web survey, and encouraged them to participate in the study. The participants filled out the questionnaire anonymously. Data collection began in November 2004 and was completed in March 2005. Quantitative data collected through closed‐ended questions were analyzed using SPSS data software. Responses to open‐ended questions were analyzed and used to supplement the findings. Results Satisfaction with Recruitment and Retention of Students of Color When participants were asked if they were satisfied with the recruitment effort by LIS programs, their responses were almost evenly split: 34 percent ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $n=62$ \end{document} ) satisfied and 34 percent dissatisfied.

When the satisfaction level was compared across different ethnic groups, most groups seemed to be neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with such efforts, except Hispanics. A one‐way ANOVA revealed that there was a significant difference among the ethnic groups in terms of their satisfaction with retention efforts ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $F=2.925$ \end{document} , \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $p< .05$ \end{document} ).

Effective Strategies for Recruiting Students of Color When asked to select the ten most effective recruitment strategies, the participants responded as follows (see table 3). The top five strategies were (1) assistantship/scholarship/financial aid, (2) ethnic diversity in faculty, (3) role models from ethnic groups, (4) presence of faculty/staff of color in the recruitment process, and (5) opportunities to work in LIS‐related fields. All five strategies were chosen by more than half of the participants.

The independent sample chi‐square (χ2) test was conducted on each strategy in order to test group differences. In other words, whether a strategy was more likely to be chosen by specific ethnic group(s) rather than by others was tested. Of the twenty‐seven recruitment strategies, statistically significant group differences were found in the following six strategies: (1) ethnic diversity of LIS faculty, (2) communication/advertising in media/publications for people of color, (3) recruitment materials developed for students of color, (4) presentation of the LIS program/career opportunities in high schools, (5) distance learning options in the LIS program, and (6) existence of committees/systems reinforcing diversity/antidiscrimination in the LIS school/program (see table 4).

Although ethnically diverse faculty in LIS programs was considered as one of the most effective strategies (ranked second overall), it was perceived to be less effective by the African American group than by others. However, African Americans considered communication and advertisement of LIS programs in media/publications for people of color and presentation of LIS programs/career opportunities in high schools to be more effective than other groups did. To Native Americans, distance education options in LIS programs seemed to be of particular importance. In the Hispanic group, more respondents perceived having committees/systems reinforcing diversity/antidiscrimination in LIS programs to be an effective strategy than did respondents in the African American group. Both African American and Native American groups regarded using recruitment materials developed for students of color as more effective than the Hispanic group did. Effective Strategies for Retaining Students of Color The participants’ response regarding the ten most effective retention strategies is presented in table 5. Again, strategies suggested by more than half of the participants made the top five: (1) assistantship/scholarship/financial aid, (2) opportunities to work part‐time in LIS‐related fields, (3) faculty/staff sensitive to the needs of students of color, (4) mentoring programs, and (5) effective academic/career advising.

In open‐ended questions, a number of respondents suggested that interventions to attract students of color to the LIS field should start as early as high school. When the answers from different ethnic groups were analyzed, the top three target groups were the same for all participants—while working in the LIS or non‐LIS fields and while in undergraduate programs—with one exception: a larger proportion of the Asian American respondents decided to pursue LIS studies while they were in a graduate program (ranked second among Asian Americans).

When the lists of influential factors by different ethnic groups were compared, previous library work experience and academic and public librarians were always among the top five. Interestingly, school librarians were more influential in African American and Hispanic groups than in others: school librarians were ranked fifth by both groups. Discussion The success of a program can be evaluated in different ways, and client satisfaction is an important way to measure it. The study findings that were related to the satisfaction of participants (the target clients of recruitment/retention programs in the past) seem to suggest that these efforts have not been very successful. The participants tended to be rather dissatisfied, especially with the retention efforts. In the open‐ended question section, several respondents indicated that they felt forgotten and abandoned once they were recruited and began their studies in LIS schools/programs. It is already difficult to recruit students of color into the LIS field, and we cannot afford to lose them once they are in our programs. LIS schools need to make sure not only to recruit new students of color but also to support and help the current students to be successful in their LIS program. One of the noteworthy findings was the rather consistent dissatisfaction expressed by the Hispanic group, especially with retention efforts. Recent U.S. population statistics provide useful information that can help us understand why. The U.S. census data [67] indicate that Hispanics are one of the most rapidly growing populations in the United States. Hispanics constituted 12.6 percent of the U.S. population in 2000, and they are projected to be 15.5 percent by 2010 and 24 percent by 2050. By 2010, Hispanics will become the largest among the four minority groups. In LIS schools, however, Hispanics constituted only 2.7 percent of the LIS student population in 2000 [68] and 3.7 percent in 2002 [3]—about a ten‐point gap between the LIS and U.S. populations. More aggressive recruitment and retention plans are urgently needed for minorities and Hispanics in particular. Regarding recruitment, several effective strategies were identified. The top ten recruitment strategies can be divided into three groups: (1) financial support and work/career opportunity, (2) diversity in faculty/staff and students/alumni, and (3) active recruitment including advertisement and personal contacts. The first group consists of four strategies: (1) assistantship/scholarship/financial aid, (2) opportunities to work in LIS‐related fields, (3) special programs (opportunities to work with LIS faculty, graduate students, or librarians), and (4) availability of career services/job placement in the LIS school/program. For most students, it is important that they can support themselves financially and find a job upon graduation. If LIS programs can provide students with these (e.g., offering scholarships/financial aid or part‐time work opportunities and providing career service/job placement), such programs will be more successful in recruiting students of color. This finding is consistent with extant studies that highlight the importance of financial aid in recruitment and retention [46, 56, 57]. It was interesting to find that offering special programs to support collaboration between students of color and LIS faculty/students was among the frequently suggested strategies in this study. This kind of program can achieve several objectives at the same time. Through such programs, students can learn what the LIS field is about. They can also meet with some authoritative figures who can be their role models as well as mentors. Furthermore, the entire experience would be rewarding intellectually as well as financially. It would be worthwhile if LIS schools/programs were to consider offering such special programs. Other important strategies are related to diversity. These include another four strategies: (1) ethnic diversity of faculty in the LIS school/program, (2) role models from ethnic groups, (3) presence of faculty and staff of color in the recruitment process, and (4) presence of alumni of color in the recruitment process. Role models or authoritative figures of color are found to be especially crucial in recruiting minority students [20, 46]. If students see role models or authoritative figures from ethnic minority groups in everyday life, and also during the recruitment process, they would be able to relate themselves more easily to the model figures and the field in which they work. The students would also feel more confident about their success in the field. Underscoring the importance of role models, one of the participants wrote, “I once had a little girl tell me that she wanted to be a librarian. I wonder if she would have said that had I not been there to show her that little African American girls can grow up to be librarians.” In order to have more diverse role models, of course, we will need to produce and hire more librarians and faculty of color. Finally, the importance of active recruitment cannot be overemphasized. Two strategies are related to active recruitment: (1) communication/advertising in media and publications for people of color and (2) active solicitation and personal contacts from the LIS school/program. A number of participants responded that they had seen no visible efforts made by their LIS program for recruiting students of color. Obviously, LIS programs will need to be more active in advertising their programs to the target community and soliciting prospective students, which has also been suggested in other studies [46, 57]. In addition, as many participants suggested, presenting LIS programs in undergraduate classes and high schools should be implemented. In general, there was a consensus in terms of effective recruitment strategies. However, it should also be noted that some differences exist among ethnic groups in the strategies they view to be effective. Although these ethnic groups were often lumped together as the “minority,” it is evident that they have different views and values and that they might prefer different recruitment and retention strategies [63]. Further research is called for in order to better understand each of the ethnic groups and to investigate strategies that would work best for each group. For retention, the top ten strategies can also be divided into three groups: (1) financial support and work/career opportunity; (2) support by faculty/staff, students, and ethnic associations; and (3) curriculum and class schedule. The first group consists of three strategies: (1) assistantship/scholarship/financial aid, (2) opportunities to work in LIS‐related fields, and (3) career services/job placement in the LIS program. Financial support seems to be vital to both recruitment and retention [45, 46, 56]. Students need to pay for tuition and other related expenses, which can be at least partially resolved through getting an assistantship/financial aid or holding a job. By offering more financial support and work opportunities, LIS programs can help students stay in the program without worrying too much about financial issues. To assist students in a job search, LIS programs will also need to provide effective career/job placement services. The second group is related to support for students of color, and consists of five strategies: (1) faculty and staff sensitive to the needs and concerns of students of color, (2) mentoring programs in the LIS school/program, (3) effective academic and career advising (sensitive to the needs and concerns of students of color), (4) partnerships between the LIS program and ethnic associations, and (5) support groups/systems in the LIS program for students of color. Support by faculty, staff, peer students, and other groups is critical to the success of any students in LIS programs, including students of color. The faculty and staff members should try to be more sensitive to the views and needs of students of color and provide effective academic and career advising. Mentoring systems would be particularly important to students of color [20, 61]. Being in the minority, students of color can easily feel isolated and often suffer “cultural loneliness” [69]. The LIS program might consider training all of its members to better understand and appreciate different cultures. Fostering support groups and systems for minority students would also be helpful. In addition, it would be beneficial to have ethnic associations and communities involved in teaching and student activities. Such collaboration between LIS programs and ethnic associations would provide more mentoring opportunities to students of color, increase all students’ exposure to diversity issues, and forge a closer relationship between the LIS programs and different communities. Curriculum and class schedules are another area vital to retention and include two strategies: (1) flexible class times and (2) curriculum incorporating diversity/multiculturalism. As also suggested by others, LIS programs need to make a greater effort to incorporate diversity and multiculturalism into their curriculum [70]. This can be done by offering courses dedicated to diversity and multiculturalism issues, by incorporating these issues in all courses, and by offering opportunities for students to work in diverse communities [35, 66]. When asked about major barriers in the recruitment/retention of students of color, about 59 percent of the respondents said “lack of institutional commitment,” and 46 percent said “monocultural curriculum.” If LIS schools demonstrate their commitment to diversity by supporting an atmosphere favorable to diversity and a curriculum incorporating multiculturalism, students of color will feel more comfortable and appreciated in the program. Furthermore, all the students will learn to appreciate other cultures and their values and be better prepared to work in an increasingly diverse society [71]. It is crucial that LIS programs take action to address these issues sooner rather than later. A number of participants also suggested that flexible class times would be effective for retention of students. This seems to have some connection with the financial issue. As the amount of financial aid LIS programs can offer is limited, flexible class times would be helpful for those who need to work in order to support their studies or for those who are already working. This observation seems to be supported by previous research. Kathleen de la Peña McCook and William E. Moen discovered that financial assistance was the second most important reason among full‐time students for selecting LIS schools, while openness to working adults (i.e., flexibility of scheduling and availability of advising) was the second most important reason among part‐time students [72]. Many LIS schools already offer courses in evening hours or during the weekend. In addition, an increasing number of schools have online courses to accommodate these needs. It should be noted, however, that the flexibility in class times is not just relevant to ethnic minority groups. The LISSADA (LIS Students’ Attitudes, Demographics, and Aspirations) survey showed that openness to the working adult (e.g., flexible time schedule) was among the top three factors for whites as well as other ethnic minority groups in their decision to choose an LIS school to attend [72]. When suggestions on the recruitment/retention strategies made by different ethnic groups were analyzed, some significant differences were found among ethnic minority groups. Among Native Americans, for example, offering distance learning options in LIS programs was ranked consistently higher than in other groups, for both recruitment (fifth) and retention (sixth). It seems that Native Americans appreciate the opportunity to pursue studies without having to leave their home or community, more than other ethnic groups. This seems to be consistent with the findings of the LISSADA survey [72]: only 15 percent of Native American participants moved to a different state to attend LIS programs, which was the lowest rate among ethnic minority groups. Once effective recruitment/retention strategies are identified, it is important to decide how to implement them. First of all, we must identify the target groups. The study findings indicate that a number of participants decided to pursue LIS studies while working in the LIS field (26.9 percent). Paraprofessional librarians would be one of the most important target groups for recruitment, which is consistent with the recommendation from others [45, 46]. Paraprofessionals are also found to be an important target group in other professional fields, including nursing and education [43, 73, 74]. Findings suggest that undergraduate (17.6 percent), graduate (7.1 percent), and high school students (4.4 percent) are also potential target groups. Another important thing to find out is which groups can help LIS schools recruit and retain students of color. A majority of the respondents indicated that their previous library work experience and librarians influenced their decision to pursue studies in LIS. Clearly, librarians are the most important partner group for recruiting students of color [45, 46, 65]. Emphasizing the importance of librarians’ role in recruitment, a participant wrote, “I have taken the time to take some of my staff members for a visit to my alma mater. Advisors there were expecting the visit and also took the time to explain some of the programs. Out of the three I have taken in the past years, one is graduating … , the other has taken three classes. … The third one is finishing her bachelor degree … and has a clear idea on how to proceed about enrolling for her MLS.” This underscores the importance of librarians as recruiters, mentors, and role models for students, which has been echoed in other studies [48]. It also confirms the effectiveness of personal contact, as discussed earlier [57]. LIS schools need to work more closely with librarians to recruit and retain students. Libraries, universities, and ethnic minority organizations are considered to be important partners in the recruitment/retention of LIS students. Libraries, for example, can promote and support cultural diversity through programming, collection management, and other information services. They can also work with LIS schools to organize information sessions, career days, or open houses and to provide students with work or internship opportunities [21]. Universities are another key partner in recruitment. They can help LIS programs in many ways, such as advertising the LIS programs, promoting and supporting diversity, providing scholarship funding and internship opportunities, and offering career and mentoring services. Finally, ethnic minority associations can help LIS schools advertise LIS programs in various ethnic communities; reach out to minority communities through fieldwork, internship, or other work opportunities; and mentor students. Conclusion The study findings helped reassess the efforts in recruiting and retaining students of color in LIS programs. The findings suggest that LIS schools need to make a more balanced effort in the retention as well as the recruitment of students since ethnic diversity in LIS can be achieved only when the recruitment of minority students is accompanied by their successful retention. More support for retention efforts is called for. The study also helped identify effective strategies for recruiting and retaining students of color. While finding a general consensus with regard to the effectiveness of recruitment and retention strategies, the study revealed differences among ethnic groups. Apart from implementing generally effective strategies, more research is needed to better understand the preference and needs of different ethnic minority groups and to identify recruitment/retention strategies relevant to each group. This kind of tailor‐made approach should be encouraged to address the uneven levels of underrepresentation among ethnic groups. The demographics of our society are rapidly changing. Preparing LIS education and the profession for this diverse society is one of the key concerns in the field. This study shed light on some key areas of focus and potential improvement for recruitment/retention of students of color in LIS programs, a first step toward increasing diversity in LIS education and the profession. More empirical research will be needed to expand the understanding of different ethnic groups in terms of their unique as well as common experiences and preferences. Such research will help refine strategies for recruiting and retaining various ethnic groups. A large‐scale survey based on probability sampling should also be conducted to increase the generalizability of the findings. Research surveying the views of faculty and administrators in LIS schools and other partner organizations will be invaluable as it can uncover challenges and potential solutions from the organizational perspective. Recruiting and retaining a diverse population in LIS education and the LIS profession is an endeavor that requires careful planning and systematic efforts. More research and empirical evidence on this topic is imperative to the success of this important endeavor.
