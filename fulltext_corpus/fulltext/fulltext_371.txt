PAPER IMPERMANENCE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF pH AND STORAGE CONDITIONS RICHARD DANIEL SMITH INTRODUCTION T HE weakened condition of books and the speed with which library collections are deteriorating con- cern all librarians. Many know that alum has been used by papermakers for many years to precipitate rosin sizes and that hydrogen ions derived from alum* are a major cause of paper deterioration. Most librarians may not appreciate that other sources provide a sufficient number of hydrogen ions to destroy paper and that alum was used intentionally for hundreds of years to preserve paper. Storage conditions, par- ticularly excessive bookstack tempera- tures, can destroy otherwise permanent papers. This article aims to provide some basic information, references to further information, and a sense of proportion about the action of hydrogen ions and storage conditions on paper. Other im- portant causes of paper deterioration, such as oxidative degradation, biolog- ical attack, photocatalyzed degradation, and mechanical wear and tear, will not be considered at this time. The causes of book deterioration can be examined in two ways, according to the causes over which librarians exercise little or no control or according to the causes over which librarians could exercise much, if not complete, control. This study is particularly interested in the improvements in paper permanence to which librarians can contribute. It assumes that librarians do not control the manufacture of books or book com- ponents such as paper, the storage of a book before its arrival at the library, or the manner in which a borrower treats a book; but they are responsible for storage conditions in their libraries. Hydrolytic degradation of cellulose in paper fibers, as catalyzed by hydro- gen ions, is accepted as the most im- portant cause of book paper deteriora- tion in most libraries. The rate of de- terioration normally increases with a decrease in the pH value (increase in acidity) of a water extract of any paper. The rate of this deterioration, given a constant pH, is largely determined by the temperature and the relative humid- ity, which controls the moisture content, in the library bookstacks. A number of recent publications [1, 6, 23, 35, 82, 94, 95, 106 ] discuss the deterioration and/or preservation of library materials and provide access to further sources of information. Browning and Wink [ 1 1 ] are studying the prediction of paper permanence and accept the gen- eral validity of accelerated aging tests for estimating the permanence of paper. They stress, however, that ( 1.) non- uniformity of paper, (2) variability of test results from conventional methods of paper testing, and (3) lack of knowledge about use and storage con- ditions preclude an accurate estimate of exDected life. * Papermakers alum [A12(SO4)3 * 14H20, A12- (SO4) 3 * 18H20, or a mixture of these hydrates] came into widespread use in the paper industry about 1875 [60, p. 106]. The early product prob- ably contained free sulfuric acid and substantial quantities of iron sulfate. The alum (Roman alum) used by earlier papermakers was potassium alum EK2SO4 * A12(S04)3 * 24H20]. Both alums are acridic. 153
154 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY Much of the acidity in the paper of library books occurs as a consequence of manufacturing operations, primarily alum-rosin sizing. Other sources of acid- ity include acidic gases taken up from polluted storage atmospheres and the natural deterioration products of book and paper components. Some under- standing of the relative importance of these sources of acidity, as well as of the influence of storage conditions, is desirable. It is useful, therefore, to con- sider certain aspects of nineteenth- and twentieth-century paper manufacture, air pollution, and library storage practices. NINETEENTH-CENTURY BEGINNINGS The paper industry was in a state of crisis at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The quantity of paper fibers available was insufficient to meet the demands for paper. Paper mills occa- sionally closed for lack of cotton and linen rags. Rags were a strategic ma- terial and governments took steps to maintain supplies. So critical was the need that it was unpatriotic in England and Germany to use cotton and linen garments for burying the dead [52, p. 311]. Burial garments were made from wool fibers which were unsuited for papermaking. This shortage of raw ma- terials called for changes in methods of papermaking. John Murray, a Scottish lecturer and writer, is frequently cited [19, pp. 1165-68; 30, p. 154; 35, p. 613; 36, pp. 165-66; 42; 44, p. 1157; 48; 49; 58, p. 1; 72, p. 4] to support the con- tention that deleterious changes in papermaking practices commenced in the early 1800's. Initially, in 1829, Mur- ray [74] looked backward. He did not weigh the alleged sacrifices in paper quality against the general social benefit of more paper for more books. Sim- monds [93, p. 180], in his 1859 paper "On the Utilization of Waste Sub- stances," told of two pioneering con- tributions by Murray. One [76] was the Descriptive Account of the Palo de Vaca or Cow Tree of the Caracas (1838), printed on paper made from "musa textilis" (abaca or Manila hemp). In the other [75], An Account of the Phormium Tenax; or New-Zea- land Flax (printed on paper made of its leaves, with a postscript on paper) (1836), Murray emphasized over- bleaching and poor quality of raw ma- terials as more serious causes of de- terioration than excessive acidity [75, pp. 24-34]. (Murray's recommendation [75, p. 33] to use syrup of violets to determine whether excessive acidity existed in paper had real merit. B. L. Browning, senior research associate, Institute of Paper Chemistry, Appleton, Wisconsin, suggests that anthocyanins in the syrup of violets acted as a pH indicator that shifted from red to blue or vice versa at about a pH of 7.) While the references cited above properly credit Murray for recognizing excessive acidity and overbleaching as causes of deterioration, they fail to report that he enumerated other causes of paper deterioration and that some of his speculations were wide of the mark. It seems desirable, therefore, to obtain another opinion about paper- making in the early 1800's and to inquire whether scholars were con- cerned in even earlier times about the impermanence of paper. Speaking before the Royal Institu- tion on February 25, 1831, Cowper ex- pressed an understanding of paper- making, publishing, and the dissemina- tion of knowledge: It is economy of production which must in- troduce an improved article into general use. It is comparatively of little importance to have
PAPER IMPERMANENCE: pH AND STORAGE CONDITIONS 155 beautiful books unless they are cheap, and this desirable object has been attained by the im- provements in paper-making and printing. The process of bleaching has mainly contrib- uted to the improvement in the quality of pa- per, while the paper machine, the principal object of this evening, has secured economy of production.... It is gratifying to observe the extensive results of the improvements in paper and printing. Whether we turn to the depart- ments of morals, of science, or of the imagina- tion, books are now published to an extent far greater than at any former period. An expen- sive work on political economy never reaches the poor misguided labourer who destroys ma- chinery; but when "The Results of Machinery" is published, containing two hundred pages for one shilling, in three months 25,000 are in the hands of the very people who ought to have them. Who would not have supposed that al- most all the readers of Sir Walter Scott's ad- mirable tales had been already supplied; and yet as soon as a cheap edition is brought out, the publishers themselves are astonished at the demand, which obliges them to print more than 1,000 volumes every day for three years, i.e., more than 1,000,000 volumes [22, pp. 252, 254]. Murray's viewpoint was more or less anticipated by Ahasverus Fritsch, in A bkandlungen von denen Buchdruk- kern, Buckhdndlern, Papiermachern, und Buckbindern, published at Regens- burg in 1750, a translation of an earlier Latin work: It is of great importance for the learned world that paper for printing is well made, and it is the duty of Government to see to this. Now-a-days many scholars complain that in several places paper is not strong and white enough, but dirty and thin, which is used in printing offices. Among others, the main reason may be the great number of printing offices and the nearly unbelievable quantity of books which are printed every day, and for which the printers are not inclined to make great costs. And as the papermakers can hardly send enough paper to the printers, they become careless and covetous. Really, 100 years ago [1631?] they made paper twice as good, as strong, as the paper they make now-a-days [107, p. 2]. Murray was correct in saying that industrial practices changed about 1800. Power machines were introduced and the Industrial Revolution could not be denied. However, other changes not connected with papermaking, for ex- ample, lighting, had detrimental effects on book permanence. Illuminating gas (also called coal or town's gas) came into widespread use in the early 1800's. Faraday, better known as a chemist and physicist than as a journeyman bookbinder [99, p. 155], commented briefly in 1842 upon the deterioration of leather bookbind- ings as he presented an improved design for a gas lamp. There has been a great interest among the members of the Athenaeum about certain effects which have been produced in the bind- ings of the books, and in fact, our loss in the destruction of books is very great. It was sup- posed it was all the effect of the gas. I have very little doubt it is due to the gas as a whole, partly to the vapour that arises from the gas, and partly it is due to the heat, to the state in which the air is kept in the room, the high tem- peratures of atmosphere conjointly with cer- tain things which the leather-dresser puts into the leather, and certain effects of the gas itself [32, p. 245]. Calvert [14] investigated the condition of the leather bindings and their acidity in the Portico Library, Manchester, England, in 1851. He defined three mechanisms whereby leather bindings became unnecessarily acidic: (1) poor tannery practices, (2) air pollution oc- curring outside the library, and (3) air pollution caused by gas lamps within the library. Leighton [68] reviewed library pres- ervation and restoration practices in 1858. He concluded that improvements in paper quality were desirable. His lecture and the discussion which fol- lowed provided more information on the action of gas lamps and sparked a series of acrimonious letters between Letheby and others [691 on the hazards and
156 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY kinds of acid in the fumes of coal gas lamps. Apparently, the correspond- ents were talking about two different kinds of illuminating gas: (1) the raw product and (2) a refined product from which the sulfur gases had been re- moved [21]. These letters are important because their arguments indicate that mid-nineteenth-century technology was greatly different from that practiced today. In 1894, Irvine and Woodhead sum- marized developments in the preceding few decades by way of their Introduc- tion to "On the Presence in Paper of Residual Chemicals Used in Its Prep- aration": The simultaneous removal of excise restric- tion from the manufacture of paper and the publication of newspapers form an era in the Victorian age, and the effect which followed was marked by the great increase of newspapers and their circulation, causing an extraordinary demand for increased supplies of paper. Thirty years ago [1864], most (if not all) of the paper produced in Great Britain was manu- factured from rags; the process then obtaining being the homely one of boiling with weak leys [sic] of soda, followed by use of bleaching materials in very limited amount. Paper was then practically made up of pure fiber inter- woven or felted together. Now cheap papers are a peculiar compound of China clay, stucco, and resin held together by a skeleton of fibrous material obtained from wood, esparto grass, or straw, from which the fibre is eliminated only by drastic and costly chemical treatment. Had these new materials not been at hand, the rag supply of the world would have been in- sufficient to meet the present wants of Great Britain alone. As a natural consequence paper fell in price, and the expensive chemical operations neces- sitated the use of cheap loading materials as compensation-whilst the careful but tedious washing of the fibre or half stuff had either to be partially or wholly done away with [53, p. 131]. Beadle [7] pointed out during the Discussion at the end of his "Recent History of Paper Making" that certain preservatives used in 1800 (for ex- ample, gelatin sizing) were used far less in 1898. He indicated that paper- makers could no longer afford the use of gelatin because it cost as much as all the rest of the raw materials in the paper. Paper had become a commodity primarily composed of fibers from wood sources. It was no longer relatively rare or providentially of permanent quality. Papermakers were expected to supply a printable product with severely limit- ed equipment, impure and variable raw materials, and very little ability to measure or control such fundamentals for quality production as solution strengths and operating temperatures. Paper impermanence concerned ar- chivists and librarians as well as cel- lulose chemists and papermakers during the last quarter of the nineteenth cen- tury. So many articles were produced expressing such a variety of opinions that just about any retrospective view desired can be thoroughly documented. Unfortunately, suggestions to improve paper permanence were either pre- mature or impractical. That is, al- though some paper produced during the last quarter of the nineteenth century was of permanent quality, the present- day condition of late-nineteenth-century books in libraries implies that the bulk of the paper produced was imper- manent. THE TWENTIETH CENTURY The report of the Committee of the Royal Society of Arts on Paper De- terioration [86] summarized require- ments for paper permanence in 1898. The expertness of the Committee is indicated in the Dictionary of National Biography [26]. It included Richard Garnett, Keeper of Printed Books at
PAPER IMPERMANENCE: pH AND STORAGE CONDITIONS 157 the British Museum and past president of the Library Association; William J. Russell, an expert on gas analysis and past president of the Chemical Society and the Institute of Chemistry; and Charles F. Cross, a distinguished cel- lulose chemist of international repute. The Committee noted that acidity had caused actual disintegration in papers of all qualities. They explained that these destructive acids could: (1) have been present in the original paper, (2) have resulted from reactions going on in the paper itself, or (3) have been due to products of gas combustion. The Committee recommended for a permanent paper that "slightly acid reaction (acid to litmus, neutral to methyl orange) should be given to paper with the normal slight excess of alum" [86, p. 600]. Litmus (azolitmin) and methyl orange are standard pH in- dicators whose color shifts probably occur, insofar as this specification is concerned, at pH values of 6.0 and 4.0, respectively. An 1898 recommendation for a permanent book paper was a water extract pH value exceeding 4.0 and less than 6.0. We now know that a paper with a water extract (presumably hot) pH value of 4.0 would be severely embrittled in time, regardless of the quality or quantity of its fibers and other components. For purposes of this discussion, however, let us accept a hot water extract pH of 4.0 as the minimum for a first-class, permanent book paper insofar as expert knowledge was con- cerned at the beginning of the twentieth century. In 1904, the U.S. Department of Agriculture began an investigation of suitable papers for government pur- poses. By 1909, some 5,000 papers had been investigated and three reports [102, 103, 104] had been issued. Several comments in the last report, Durability and Economy in Papers for Permanent Records, recognize the balance of acid and alkali as a problem: Strength and durability are affected also by the presence of bleaching agents, mineral salts, excessive quantities of sizing material, and free acids. All of these act more or less rapidly on the fibers of the paper and slowly disintegrate them, so that in time the paper becomes weak and brittle. For this reason paper should con- tain no free acid nor soluble salts which may yield acids in the paper [104, p. 15]. While an alkaline paper is probably more rapidly attacked by bacteria [fungi?] than an acid one, free acid will itself destroy paper, and for these reasons paper should be neutral [104, p. 16]. Printing and writing papers must not con- tain free acid, alkali, or bleaching materials and must be well washed to remove soluble salts [104, p. 301. It is difficult in 1969 to determine what these comments meant to a papermaker sixty years ago, because (1) papermak- ing raw materials and manufacturing methods are no longer the same as then and (2) a laboratory method of defin- ing acidity in paper is not given in any of the three reports. However, Durabil- ity and Economy in Papers for Per- manent Records listed specifications for five qualities of printing papers. These specifications allow a maximum of 1 per cent rosin in the specification for the first-grade paper. If 0.5 per cent or 1 per cent rosin were used today, the papermaker might use between 2 per cent and 3 per cent alum to precip- itate the alum-rosin size onto the paper fibers. The cellulose of a paper sized in this manner would be subject to hydrolytic attack and it would not be defined as permanent today. It is pos- sible to precipitate a rosin size under neutral or near neutral conditions by supplying some of the aluminum ion requirements with sodium aluminate;
158 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY however, the first patent implying the use of sodium aluminate to reduce acidity was filed by De Cew in 1917 [25]. It is also pertinent to note that the paper in the University of Chicago Library copies of these 1908 and 1909 reports is weak and brittle today. In 1928, Hoffman [45] used ac- celerated aging tests to conclude that the pH of a hot water extract of a permanent paper should not be less than 4.5 and preferably higher than 4.7. He gave pH values for twenty-four commercial papers that averaged 4.48 and ranged from 3.48 to 5.80. Two years later, Hoffman and Olsen [46] reviewed the effect of acidity on paper at the request of the chairman of the Tech- nical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry Committee on Fine and Spe- cial Papers. They reported "that if a 'permanent' paper is to be manufac- tured, the active acidity of the paper as measured imperically [sic] must not be greater than that represented by about pH 4.8 or 5.0" [46, p. 173]. The Library Association [72] pub- lished the report of their Special Com- mittee on "The Durability of Paper" in 1930. This Committee was composed of eminent librarians, representatives of government bodies, manufacturers, and professional and trade organiza- tions. Specifications for two grades of durable paper were recommended: (1) grade 1, for use where "absolute" per- manence is required, and (2) grade 2, for use where relative permanence is desired and a commercially competitive price is necessary. The recommendation of the Committee regarding acidity is inconsistent. On one hand, they indorse the use of alum-rosin size as defined by the Society of Arts in 1898. On the other hand, they specify acidity of paper in grade 1 (the specification is vague for grade 2) as a "reaction to be pH 5.5-6 in situ" [72, p. 16]. Grant [36, p. 169] phrased the questions squarely: (1) how should "in situ" be defined, and, assuming it can be defined, (2) how can reproducible pH measure- ments be made? Pierce and Rattee [79] explained some reasons why pH varies widely within paper. The Library As- sociation itself implied problems with their specification when "The Durabil- ity of Paper" was announced: "After the Report was passed for press it was found impracticable to have grade 1 (a) and (b) papers manufactured spe- cially to the Committee's specifications in time for use in the Report, as intend- ed" [71, p. 281]. Jarrell, Hankins, and Veitch [56] reported in 1938 that a grade 1 (b) paper obtained directly from the papermaker had a hot water extract pH of 4.85 (see also Table 5 and Figs. 2-8, sample 4, this article). Richter compared the permanence of rag and chemical wood pulp papers in 1931. He concluded that "hydrolysis can play an important role in the de- composition of paper" and listed fifty- eight commercial paper hot water ex- tract pH values [88, p. 380]. These pH values averaged 4.88 and ranged from 4.0 to 5.8. Burton [13] considered twenty-eight commercial book papers in 1931 (only one of which was considered per- manent) and wrote a specification for (1) permanent records, (2) semiper- manent records, (3) papers requiring moderate longevity, and (4) papers for temporary use. No pH was recommend- ed for temporary use and a minimum hot water extract pH of 4.5 was recom- mended for the more permanent papers. Rasch, Shaw, and Bicking worked with highly purified wood fibers in 1931 and concluded that "the stability of
PAPER IMPERMANENCE: pH AND STORAGE CONDITIONS 159 rosin-sized papers in the accelerated aging test was seriously impaired by the presence of excess alum, but with the control of acidity at pH 5.0 [by hot water extract] a highly stable, well sized paper could be produced" [85, p. 782]. This pH value was indorsed by Jarrell, Hankins, and Veitch, who, after studies in 1932 [54] and 1936 [55] concluded "that a moderate high acidity, that is, a pH of the [hot] water extract of less than 5, is a major factor in the de- terioration of even the best classes of paper" [55, p. 20]. Appreciation was growing that more alkaline pH values were desirable for permanent records. Grant [36] specified a minimum hot water extract pH value of 6.0 for printing papers to have per- manent qualities. He may have defined a general attitude toward book paper when he noted: "No specifications are given for the cheaper grades of paper (e.g., as used for ordinary books), be- cause in such cases the conditions of usage and storage count for so much more than the composition" [36, pp. 180-81]. Charles Scribner's Sons used three kinds of book paper in twenty- five copies of the Dictionary of Amer- ican Biography, Volume 13, and placed these copies throughout the United States and Canada for a long-term test under actual use conditions. The hot water extract pH values of these three papers were 6.4, 6.3, and 5.7, and the average, 6.1, is indicative of exceptional quality for the 1930's [70]. Casey gave a pH of 5.0 as a generally accepted pH value for permanent records in his 1952 edition [16, p. 944]. There are two general methods for the preparation of water extracts of paper for pH measurement-hot and cold extraction [98]. The pH values obtained may be approximately the same for some papers. In the case of others, the hot extraction may be one or more pH units lower than the cold extraction. One reason for this dif- ference is that the hydrolysis of alum is greater in hot water. Launer's [67] 1940 report is typical and reports that the hot water extracts of twenty-nine commercial papers averaged 0.6 pH units lower than that of their cold water extracts. The hot water extract is considered by some paper authorities as more indicative of a paper's probable permanence than its cold water extract [98]. However, there is not yet complete agreement as to whether the hot water or the cold water extraction pH value gives a better prediction of paper per- manence. Browning and Ulm [10], Grant [37], and Wooding [112] are sources of information on pH and its measurement and control in the paper industry which are not otherwise cited in the text. The above pH values recommended over the years, as well as the actual production measurements, are contrast- ed in Table 1 with cold extraction pH values obtained by Barrow [17] for the paper in books discarded from libraries in the Richmond, Virginia, area. Bar- row's cold water values might be re- duced by the 0.6 pH factor of Launer [67], but, on the other hand, a factor ought to be added to adjust for the natural decrease in pH caused by acidic degradation products. Slow oxidation of carbohydrates with production of car- boxylic acids and decrease in pH does occur during accelerated aging and presumably also during natural aging (see Table 6). It appears reasonable to neglect air pollution as a significant factor in Barrow's findings because the Richmond area is not badly polluted. Middleton [731 reports that Richmond
160 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY is much less polluted than Oakland, California, and Seattle, Washington. Oakland and Seattle were classed as unpolluted in 1936 (see Table 4). It is concluded, therefore, that the cold water extraction pH values of the papers which Barrow studied would have changed during library storage from their original value in the direc- tion of the original hot water pH ex- traction values. The pH values reported by Barrow for the paper in library books from the Richmond area suggest that even the weakest papers were in line with the earlier understanding of pH require- ments for paper permanence. Actually, the pH values listed in Table 1 indicate that papermakers may have been ahead of their time in that they probably supplied paper with a higher pH value than that which was believed essential for permanence at the time the paper was manufactured. It is desirable, before continuing this discussion of paper impermanence, to digress briefly and (1) consider an ac- cepted recommendation for the pH of paper and (2) develop guidelines for the maximum alkalinity at which li- brarians should deacidify paper. Church [18, p. 31] recommended that a per- manent paper have a minimum cold water pH of 6.5, but set no specification for the hot water extract pH value. Grant [36, pp. 180-81], an early ex- ample of recent thinking among paper scientists, suggested that a permanent paper should have a minimum hot water extract pH value of 6.0. I investigated three book papers that had cold water extract pH values of 6.90, 6.60, and 5.90. The hot water extract pH values for these three papers were 5.65, 4.60, and 4.40, respectively. The permanence of these papers improved dramatically after deacidification when evaluated against the untreated standards by a TABLE 1 pH SPECIFICATIONS FOR PERMANENT PAPERS COMPARED WITH pH VALUEs REPORTED BY BARROw AVErAGES OR RECOXENDATIONS Bmow's COLD WATER EXTRACTS* DATE | | A5 Ten Weakest Books Ten Strongest Books Source ~~Mini- DATIE___ Source mum pH Min.

PAPER IMPERMANENCE: pH AND STORAGE CONDITIONS 161 sixty-day accelerated aging test. Tech- nically speaking, it is questionable whether it would be necessary to deacidify paper with a cold water ex- tract pH value of 6.90, except that, as above, the reserve alkalinity retarded the development of an acid condition during aging. It may be concluded (1) that a cold water extract pH value of 6.5 can be misleading insofar as the potential permanence of a paper is concerned and (2) that the hot water extract pH value warrants considera- tion when papers are selected for per- manence. Studies by Richter [91], Barrow [5], and unpublished work of mine indicate that an alkalinity ranging to about a pH of 10.5 or slightly higher, is ac- ceptable for paper deacidification. I consider the pH values represented by saturated solutions of calcium and magnesium bicarbonates and carbonates and by magnesium hydroxide as sat- isfactory. (Calcium and magnesium bicarbonates exist only in solution; on drying they are converted to carbon- ates.) However, the use of a saturated calcium hydroxide solution as recom- mended in the first stage of the Barrow Method [6, p. 32] is open to question. Barrow himself provided data indicat- ing that a spray deacidification solution saturated with calcium hydroxide re- duced the folding endurance of a paper by 46 per cent, from 530 folds to 287 folds [5, Table 3]. The harmful effect of calcium hydroxide appeared to cease once the chemical was converted to the less alkaline and less soluble bicarbon- ate or carbonate. The effective concen- tration of calcium and magnesium bi- carbonate solutions can be increased through the use of cold soda water as the solvent. Thus far, the pH of library paper materials has been considered from the viewpoint that acidity destroys paper and that alum is a major source of that acidity. This outlook is incomplete even though it is technically correct. Beadle commented on the standards of paper consumers and opened up an interesting area for discussion in his 1902 lecture on "The Permanence of Paper": The public of the present day care little about the permanence of a paper; in fact, there is no reason for them to care, as far as the greater part of our literature is concerned. With the ancients it was quite different; their paper was exceedingly costly, and was frequently used for the preservation of valuable records that were kept for centuries without destruction. They made a close study of the permanence of papers [8, p. 113]. Beadle went on to discuss the preserva- tion practices of earlier days. Acidic substances have been used to preserve library materials since ancient times. In 181 B.C., Cneius Terentius opened a 535-year-old coffer and found papyrus books in good condition, pre- sumably because they were covered with citrus leaves [80, p. 192] or were soaked in citrus oil [81, p. 151]. Pliny the Elder recommended the addition of a small quantity of vinegar in the flour paste used to size papyri [80, p. 191; 81, p. 149]. In 1801, Koops [62, pp. 85-87] re- ported that the destruction of books and records by insects caused the Royal Society of Sciences in Gottingen (Goittingen, Prussia?) in 1773 to offer a premium for a definition of the prob- lem and its solution. Dr. Herman of Strasburgh (Strasbourg, France?) won the premium, with Flad of Heidelburgh (Heidelberg, Palatinate?) taking sec- ond place. Among other things, they recommended that bookbinders use glue mixed with alum in place of paste. Koops [62, pp. 87-89] noted further
162 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY that paper was rapidly destroyed by dampness and insects in North America. He also reported that in 1785 the Soci- ety of Sciences in Philadelphia, at the suggestion of Mr. Franqois, an honor- ary member from Neufchatel (Neuf- chatel, France?) solicited answers for two problems: (1) an effective remedy to protect paper against insect attack and (2) a method of making an insect- resistant paper for use in St. Domingo (West Indies?). All of the responses recommended the addition of sharp and bitter, or other, ingredients to the size which might kill insects, for example, vinegar, alum, vitriol, salt, turpentine, extract of aloes, wormwood, camphor, and arsenic. The recommendation of sulfuric acid (vitriol) emphasizes the gravity of their problem when viewed with respect to the speed by which the acid carbonizes paper. Arsenic, though poisonous, is a good germicide and has been recommended by the Manuscript Division, Library of Congress, for use in flour pastes [33, p. 36]. All of these remedies were rejected as insufficient or dangerous, and the Society renewed its search. Koops [62, p. 89] implied that the problem remained unresolved when he promised that the paper to be produced in his paper mill at Mill-Bank, West- minster, England, would be insect resistant. The two kinds of paper, (1) de-inked rag and (2) wood fiber, in the University of Chicago copy of Koops's 1801 second edition appear to be in excellent condition. There are no signs of foxing or insect attack. Both papers are flexible, although the wood pulp paper is a light brown color. It is unclear whether the wood pulp paper was not bleached or has discolored since it was made. Voorn's [ 107, p. 13] translation of a French papermaker's 1803 description of Koops's operation from Annales des arts et manufactures [(October-November, 1803), 11:199- 207] stated that Koops was unable to exhibit fully bleached straw fiber paper. The straw and wood fiber papers are now uniformly a light brown color in the first, second, and third edition copies of Koops's work held by the Dard Hunter Paper Museum, Institute of Paper Chemistry, Appleton, Wisconsin. Koops's first edition is the first Eu- ropean book which contains wood fibers produced on a commercial scale. Hunter [52, p. 333] considered Koops to be the father of the paper industry as we know it today, while Voorn [107, p. 2] in- dicated that Koops was both the last of the experimenters and the first of a new breed of papermaker. The paper in his second edition was produced by the Neckinger Mill, Bermondsey, London, England, as was probably the paper in the first edition. Koops's mill, the largest at that time in Europe, was established in 1801 and failed in 1804 [107, p. 13]. Beadle [7, p. 417] examined the straw and wood fiber papers in Koops's 1800 first edition almost 100 years later, in 1898. Beadle concluded that the won- derfully preserved condition of the paper in Koops's book was due to the papers being heavily sized as well as to something which the size contained. Beadle stated that the wood fiber paper was badly discolored. He [8, pp. 114- 15] also noted that alum was one sub- stance that had been used in paper- making from the earliest times and that its antiseptic powers of preservation were largely overlooked in 1902. The date when papermakers first used alum as a dyeing mordant, pre- servative, sizing agent, size component, etc., is unknown. Voorn [107, p. 48]
PAPER IMPERMANENCE: pH AND STORAGE CONDITIONS 163 concluded from several sources that alum was commonly used in China between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, both to precipitate vegetable sizes and as a sizing agent itself. Animal gelatin sizes were developed at the Fabriano paper mills during the last half of the thirteenth century and came into common use in Europe during the fourteenth century [107, pp. 49-50]. These early gelatin sizes may have con- tained alum from the Lipari Islands as an essential ingredient. Kirkham [60, p. 105] noted the similarity of John Tate's watermark to the ancient Greek symbols for alum and wondered if the first English papermaker appreciated the properties of alum. Tate's water- mark from Wynkyn de Worde's 1495 edition of Anglicus Bartholomaeus' De proprietatibus rerum and Kirkham's renditions of the Greek symbols are reproduced in Figure 1. The use of alum to size paper was definitely established in England by 1578, when Lyte directed that paper be "soked or delayed in allom water" [60, p. 105]. In 1665, Du Gard wrote, "He wetteth with allom water every sheet of thinner paper" [60, p. 105]. John Evelyn's 1678 description of white papermaking at Byfleet, Surrey, noted that paper was dipped in alum water during sizing [31, p. 141]. Gelatin-sized paper can be hardened, made more resistant to water, by passing the sized paper through an alum or formaldehyde bath [15, p. 1136]. Eighteenth-century English, German, and French papermakers added sulfuric acid as well as alum to gelatin size and may have stopped only because the paper discolored [20, p. 18; 108, p. 50]. Two editions of Lelande's L'art de faire le papier indicated an average of one part potassium alum per 200 parts paper I Tate's watermark Greek symbols for alum FIG. 1.-The first English watermark and Greek symbols for alum.

164 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY product [63, p. 83; 64, p. 501]. Hudson [49] reported that Lelande recommend- ed a maximum of 24 per cent alum on gelatin, perhaps for summer papermak- ing. Nineteenth-century French paper- makers used far greater quantities of alum, an initial addition of 10 per cent when cooking the hides plus a 30-40 per cent addition at the sizing tub [108, p. 50]. The initial addition may have been part of a preparatory treat- ment to the hides and would have in- creased the amount of gelatin extracted from the hides. Beadle [8, p. 92] com- puted that more alum was introduced through gelatin sizing when papers were both internally (alum-rosin) and surface (gelatin) sized. It would be expected, as demonstrated by Richter [89, p. 1155-56; 90, p. 179], that ad- ditions of alum at the above levels would result in paper deterioration. On the other hand, librarians must ap- preciate that, for many hundreds of years, alum served essential papermak- ing functions, such as sizing, preventing gelatin spoilage prior to sizing, and reducing, if not preventing, fungus and insect attack. Alum is sometimes added to gelatin size today to control viscosity and act as a preservative. The pH values of gelatin sizes may range from 5.5 to 7.5, but they should be around 6.0 to 6.5 for best results [15, p. 1135]. Alum was commonly used as a pre- servative in flour pastes which bonded the bookbinding leather to the boards [14, p. 122] and to repair manuscripts [33, p. 36]. The excellent condition of many fine, old leather bookbindings implies that, insofar as flour pastes are concerned, alum was more beneficial than harmful. The recommendations in 1960 by Vaughn [101, p. 80] and in 1962 by the U.S. Government Printing Office [100, p. 224] of 0.3 per cent alum in their recipes suggest, unfortunately, that a generally accepted substitute for alum has not been found. The preservation of foodstuffs and other perishables through pickling (for example, with vinegar) antedates re- corded history. Alum and other acidic materials have served essential paper- making operations and contributed to the permanence and/or impermanence of records for hundreds of years. Alum- rosin sizing and wood fiber sources were vital to the mass production of paper for the number of books required since the early nineteenth century. The quantity of acidic materials added to paper appears to have decreased with better control of raw materials, manu- facturing operations, and storage con- ditions. As improved storage conditions reduced the danger of fungi and insect attack, the warmer and dryer storage environments led to other difficulties in preserving books, particularly for urban libraries. IMPORTANCE OF AIR POLLUTION American librarians, like all others, were concerned about the imperma- nence of bookbindings and paper in the last half of the nineteenth century. At the Philadelphia Conference [27] in 1876, Windsor blamed gas fumes; Cut- ter and Poole cited heat; and Edwards said that dryness was the prime cause of binding deterioration. This discus- sion classes air pollution along with gas fumes, heat, and dryness in relation to storage practices. Complaints have been lodged against fumes from fossil fuels for many cen- turies. The Dunstable, Bedfordshire, Annals record that in 1257, Eleanor, queen of Henry III, left the town of Nottingham because of smoke from sea
PAPER IMPERMANENCE: pH AND STORAGE CONDITIONS 165 coal [34]. Proclamations were issued during the reigns of King Edward I and Queen Elizabeth I forbidding the use of coal during the sitting of Parlia- ment [34]. We previously noted that by the mid-nineteenth century, Faraday [32], Calvert [14], Letheby [69], and others were concerned about the effects of air pollution on books. The effects of the combustion products of coal gas lamps were frequently discussed during the remainder of the century. These contributions certainly indicate that the problem of air pollution existed, but they have limited value, because pol- lution from gas lamps was first reduced by improvements in gas quality and was later sidestepped by the introduc- tion of electric lighting. In more recent years, the effects of pollution from ur- ban atmospheres have been more widely recognized. Frey [34] provided an excellent review of air pollution in libraries up to the early 1930's. Paper scientists were interested in measuring pollution effects, and Richter [88] studied the permanence of rag, sulfite, and the re- cently introduced and well-purified high-alpha cellulose paper fibers in 1931. Among other things, Richter con- cluded: "Hydrolysis can play an im- portant part in the decomposition of paper. Data that are thus far available indicate that the attack by acid vapors is very marked in the case of all papers that were examined. The rag and purified wood pulp papers appear no more resistant to the action than the less pure papers" [88, p. 380]. Richter's hot water pH values ranged from 5.8 and 4.8 before exposure to 2 per cent sulfur dioxide (SO2) for six days at room temperature to 4.0 and 3.4, respectively, after exposure. Richter demonstrated that S02 pickup could increase the acidity of paper in labora- tory conditions to levels considerably above those found by Barrow [6, 17]. Kimberly [57] investigated S02 at- tack at the U.S. Bureau of Standards under conditions approaching those which occur in many urban libraries. He exposed various papers in S02 at- mospheres averaging 5.8 parts per mil- lion (p.p.m.) and ranging from 2 p.p.m. to 9 p.p.m. The lower value is actually achieved in some cities on occasion, and the higher end of the range is frequent- ly less than ten times the S02 content of urban atmospheres. Kimberly con- trolled relative humidity at 65 per cent and temperature at 860 F. These values of humidity and temperature are typi- cal of, or lower than, those in summer in American libraries that lack air con- ditioning. Kimberly's [57, pp. 164, 167] "Action of Sulfur Dioxide on Paper" provides data on the rate of S02 pick- up, and certain portions are adapted for presentation in Table 2. His find- ings indicate the surprising speed with which many papers are attacked. It takes only ten days for the average paper to lose about 15 per cent (0.3 half-life) of its initial folding endur- ance. True, the test papers were ar- ranged so S02 might circulate freely about them, whereas the text of library books is protected to some degree by their bindings and the margins of their leaves. Books are permeable to gases, however, and Kimberly's findings sug- gest that, given time, the innermost portions of books might be severely attacked by acidic gases. Many early investigators did not measure pH but rather analyzed the aqueous extract of a paper by titration for total acidity and reported this de- termination as the percentage of sul- furic anhydride (percentage of SO8).

PAPER IMPERMANENCE: pH AND STORAGE CONDITIONS 167 A certain quantity of such an SOs con- tent would normally represent some acids which contained no sulfur, for example, carbohydrate, fatty, or resin acids. The anhydride S03 represents a molecule of sulfuric acid (H2S04) with a molecule of water (H20) subtracted. This expression of total acidity as the percentage of S03, in Tables 2, 3, and 4 serves analytical convenience, and it does not represent a chemical such as S03 (sulfur trioxide). Sulfur trioxide occurs in polluted atmospheres as the normal oxidation product of S02 and, being hydroscopic, it quickly combines with water to form H2S04 (sulfuric acid). Sulfuric acid mists sometimes occur over cities when sufficient quan- tities of S03 are formed. Burton [13] used analyses for total acidity in de- veloping his recommendation in 1931 that a permanent paper should not contain more than 0.1 per cent SOs. This is a higher SO3 value for total acidity than would be considered de- sirable today for a permanent paper. Kimberly and Emley [58] aimed to verify their laboratory experiments by comparing the paper from identical copies of books stored under different conditions. They obtained a group of thirty-four deteriorated books from The New York Public Library and then so- licited duplicate copies of these titles from libraries throughout the United States. Eighty-five duplicate copies of thirty-one titles were received from twenty-three libraries. The books were first inspected to insure uniformity of edition and date of printing. Then the records of the contributing library were checked to insure that each copy had received approximately the same de- gree of use. Finally, corresponding sec- tions were selected from each copy for use in testing. Certain data about the sets used for testing, each of which contained a copy from The New York Public Library, are adapted from Kim- berly and Emley's "A Study of Deterio- ration of Book Papers in Libraries" [58, p. 4] for presentation in Table 3. The folding endurance of TheNewYork Public Library copy is given as an in- dex figure of 1.00, and the folding en- durance value for the other copies of each set is adjusted accordingly. Kim- berly and Emley [59] went on to de- velop an admirable scheme for purify- ing library air by washing out S02, but that development is not part of this study and will therefore not be dis- cussed. Jarrell, Hankins, and Veitch [55] re- port data on the condition of paper in ten titles published between 1850 and 1913. Portions of the data from their 1936 "Deterioration of Book and Rec- ord Papers" [55, pp. 6-7] are adapted for reproduction in Table 4. Their samples 7-A, 7-B, and 7-C are helpful as guides to interpret other data. The tests on the 7-A and 7-B copies from The New York Public Library and the Superintendent of Documents' Library revealed greater acidity and lower folding endurance in the marginal areas than in the center sections of their leaves. The leaves of the 7-C copy, protected from light and air in the Library of Congress, were stronger and less acidic in the margins than in the center areas. These different patterns presumably are caused by acidity de- riving from air pollution and ink com- ponents, with the effect of air pollution overriding that of the ink components in 7-A and 7-B. The paper scientists still lacked con- trolled experimental data which would demonstrate the extent to which acidic sulfur gases penetrated paper. Jarrell,
168 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY Hankins, and Veitch [56] reported on an experiment designed to answer this question in 1938. They bound eight kinds of high- and low-grade commer- cial book and writing papers, as de- fined in Table 5, into simulated books. These eight books were exposed for periods of 90, 180, and 330 days under conditions of relative humidity and temperature that have occurred in li- brary bookstacks. Two sets of books were prepared: one set was exposed to sulfur gases and the other set was ex- posed in an atmosphere free of such gases. The testing temperature ranged from 420 C. (1100 F.) to 520 C. (1260 F.) and averaged 500 C. (122? F.). The relative humidity ranged from 29 per cent to 48 per cent and aver- aged about 37 per cent. The gas cham- ber contained about 5.5 p.p.m. to 6.2 p.p.m. S02 based on analyses showing 0.00072 to 0.00082 grams of S03 per 100 liters of gas chamber air. In ad- dition to being exposed in book form, these papers were tested (1) for in- itial properties, (2) after three days of aging at 1000 C., and (3) when fully exposed in the gas chamber for ninety days.

PAPER IMPERMANENCE: pH AND STORAGE CONDITIONS 169 and lists certain chemical and physical data on unheated and unexposed paper samples. When they were heated in a sulfur- free atmosphere, none of the highly purified papers, with a hot water ex- tract of pH value 5.4 or greater, ex- hibited more than 8 per cent deterio- ration as measured by folding endur- ance. All papers exposed to sulfur gases deteriorated and exhibited marked changes in chemical and physical prop- erties. Progressive deterioration and increase in acidity appeared in the samples taken nearer the margin com- pared with those samples taken toward the center of the book. The depth of sulfur gas penetration-measured by increase in acidity and decrease in folding endurance-became greater with time of exposure. The experimental re- sults of Jarrell, Hankins, and Veitch [56] are considered similar to the ef- fects of severe air pollution, and these results demonstrate that, in time, S02 will penetrate throughout an exposed book and has devastating effects on paper permanence. The eight papers studied by Jarrell, Hankins, and Veitch [56] were evalu- ated after a variety of treatments. The data are particularly pertinent because they demonstrate that all kinds of paper in books will pick up enough acidity in time to be destroyed. Selected por- tions of the data are reproduced here- after. The degree of penetration into the book and the effects of subsequent acidic attack are interpreted for pH and folding endurance by bar graphs in Figures 3 to 8.

All subsam- ples A cracked easily and showed 100 per cent decrease in folding endurance after ninety days' exposure. The fol- lowing descriptions of Figures 3 to 8 are derived from Jarrell, Hankins, and Veitch [56, pp. 15-18]. Figures 3, 4, and 5 demonstrate that different parts of leaves of books can be expected to absorb different quan- tities of acid, depending upon their relative distance from the exposed edges. The amount of acid absorbed is progressively smaller as the distance of the samples from the exposed edges increases. The center sections (sub- samples E) absorbed relatively little acid during this test, but the pattern of penetration indicates that this would not be the case over prolonged periods of exposure such as occur in libraries.

Jar- rell, Hankins, and Veitch felt that this variation was related to differences in the composition and density of the test papers. For example, sample 1 picked up at least acid, was a hard-finished paper, and contained the largest amount of gelatin size (2.8 per cent). The soft- finish papers, samples 3 and 4, chemi- cal wood and rag, respectively, absorbed the most acid.

The decrease in folding endurance in the center sections (sub- samples E) was very much less than that in the most exposed sections of the same leaves (subsamples B). This pat- tern in loss of folding endurance agrees with what would be expected from the increase in acidity shown by Figures 3, 4, and 5. Jarrell, Hankins, and Veitch noted that sample 7, the permanent-record, 100 per cent rag book paper with an initial pH of 7.00, increased rather lit- tle in acidity, although it deteriorated even more than sample 8, the tempo- rary-use, sulfite writing paper with an initial pH of 3.78. The authors indi- cated that they did not know what caused the deterioration of sample 7. A reasonable conclusion is that the se- lection of papers for permanent records requires more than specifying pH level and origin of paper fiber. Thus far, we have reviewed (1) the effects of S02 on paper under acceler- ated and controlled conditions in lab- oratories and (2) the differences which occur between identical books stored under different conditions. The Joint Committee on Materials for Research [70] of the American Council of Learned Societies and the Social Sci- ence Research Council asked Charles Scribner's Sons to publish twenty-five special copies of the Dictionary of American Biography, Volume 13 (1934), and then placed these copies in libraries across the United States and Canada.

Paper A formed the first one- third of the book, B the middle one- third, and C the final one-third. All three papers were believed to be highly permanent. Lewis [69, p. 309] states that "the experiment was set up in hope of an- swering two questions. First, will a book printed on paper made from puri- fied wood pulp, known as Solka pulp, hold up as well under library use as a book printed on the same weight paper made from 100 per cent rag stock? Second, to what extent do such vari- ables as geographic location, degree of use, and atmospheric conditions affect the degree of deterioration in books printed on both rag and purified wood- pulp sheets?" In 1955, after twenty-one years of use, the books were collected and ar- rangements were made for testing at the Institute of Paper Chemistry, Appleton, Wisconsin. The lack of data on the methods of evaluating the original physical and chemical condition of the book paper made it difficult to answer precisely the questions stated above. Only a small portion of the experimental data was adapted for reproduction in Table 6, "Deterioration of Book Paper in Library Use." In all cases, both folding endurance and pH declined over the twenty-one- year period. These declines appear to be related. That is, the loss of folding endurance increases with a decrease in pH. There was no original folding en- durance value established for paper B, and the degree of this physical prop- erty loss cannot be estimated accurately. Rag paper A showed an index drop of 8.22 to 1.00, while the Solka pulp paper C suffered a drop of only 2.20 to 1.00. The rag paper was very much stronger than the Solka pulp in the beginning, and it was still stronger at the end of the twenty-one-year period. One can predict that eventually the Solka paper (which incidentally is more acidic) will be stronger, because the Solka paper is deteriorating more slowly than the rag paper. This result supports one purpose of the experiment, which was to prove that permanent chemical wood pulp papers can be manufactured. The find- ings about the effect of library location and book use are perplexing. The dif- ference in folding endurance between the best preserved paper, from the Colorado College Library, and the most deteriorated paper, from The New York Public Library, is surprisingly little. The possibility that storage tempera- ture may have caused this similarity is indicated by the findings of the next section. Hudson and his colleagues at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology have verified the above findings using radioactive sulfur (S3") to follow the rate of S02 pickup in fully exposed sheets of paper. The constant rates of S02 pickup for twelve kinds of paper are reproduced from their latest dissertation, by Ed- wards [28, 29], in my Table 7, "Rate of S02 Pickup as Measured over 350 Days." These rates of pickup were determined at 250 C. (770 F.) and 58 per cent relative humidity with S02 concentration at 10 p.p.m. The pickup rates listed in Table 7 fall into three broad categories and imply a partial explanation for the dif- ferent degrees of deterioration which commonly occur in library paper ma- terials. The first group is composed of
176 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY samples 1 and 2, which are rag filter papers and which may be envisioned as containing very pure rag paper fibers. The second group, samples 3 to 11, com- prise a range of papers believed to rep- resent commercial paper compositions. The third group is sample 12, a news- print paper. The average index numbers of the pickup rates, 1.0, 6.9, and 44.0, respectively, suggest increasing levels of acidity. These probable levels of acidity imply the differences in physical properties which librarians find existing among high-quality rag, ordinary book, and newsprint papers. This analogy is an oversimplification, but it is useful to point out that certain papers pick up S02 faster than others and, as a con- sequence, may become dangerously acidic more quickly than papers with lower pickup rates. In this connection, librarians might ask whether the ex- posure of journals and newspapers on shelves and racks is in the best interest of permanence in polluted atmospheres.

PAPER IMPERMANENCE: pH AND STORAGE CONDITIONS 177 the effects of S02 concentration, relative humidity, and certain papermaking ad- ditives on the rate of S02 pickup. He found that relative humidity, based upon exposures for five days at ap- proximately 0 per cent relative humid- ity and for over 100 days at 30 and 58 per cent relative humidity, did not significantly affect the long-term pickup rate. The long-term pickup rate was constant and proportional to the square root of the gas phase S02 concentration after an initiation period of forty-eight hours. Rosin was the only additive tested which accelerated the rate of S02 pickup, and other additives, such as iron-free alum, aluminoferric alum, iron oxide, sequestering (complexing or inhibiting) agents, and titanium dioxide, had little, if any, effect. These findings contradict Langwell's [65, pp. 172-73] opinion that trace metals, particularly iron, accelerated S02 pickup and that sequestering agents depressed the long- term rates of S02 pickup. The findings on relative humidity differ from those of Hudson, Grant, and Hockey [51, p. 446], who said that the S02 pickup rate increased directly with increasing relative humidity. Edwards [28, pp. 108-9; 29, p. 147] indicated that the average pickup rate for samples 3 to 11 predicts sulfate levels close to those actually found by Langwell [65, p. 499] in the marginal areas of leaves from books which had been discarded from Her Majesty's Patent Office and the Wandsworth Public Libraries in Lon- don, England. Edwards [29, p. 147] asserted that low relative humidities may accelerate the rate of paper deterioration because the acid concentration within the paper would increase with decrease in mois- ture content. It is difficult to define the activity of hydrogen ions in a heter- ogeneous system such as paper, and it would be desirable for Edwards to sup- port his speculation with experimental evidence. Grant, Hudson, and Hockey [38, 39] and Edwards [28] have reported on the effect of perspiration and the accelera- tion which it causes in the rate of SO2 TABLE 7 RATE OF SULFUR DIOXIDE PICKUP BY FuLLY EXPOSED PAPERS Sample ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Pickup Rate Sample Description of Paper is 10Pc Parts SOs per Day I ..... 100% rag fiber furnish filter paper 0.099 2 ..... 100% rag fiber furnish filter paper 0.056 3 ..... 100% rag fiber furnish, cream wove book paper 0.450 4 ..... 100% rag fiber furnish laboratory hand sheets 0.530 5 ..... 100% rag fiber furnish laboratory hand sheets 0.480 6 ..... 80% rag, 20% chemical wood fiber furnish, machine finish book paper 0.660 7 ..... 100% chemical wood fiber furnish book paper 0.530 8 ..... 100% chemical wood fiber furnish book paper 0.510 9 ..... 100% chemical wood fiber furnish, Aquapel sized book paper containing cal- cium carbonate 0.410 10 ..... 60% esparto, 40% chemical wood fiber furnish book paper 0.510 11 ..... 50% ground wood, 50% chemical wood fiber furnish experimental paper containing calcium carbonate made on the University of Manchester In- stitute of Science and Technology paper machine 0.640 12 ..... 80% ground wood, 20% chemical wood fiber furnish newsprint 3.460 SouRcE.-Edwards [29, p. 97 and Appendix 6].
178 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY pickup. The particular component of perspiration which causes this accelera- tion has not been identified, although there is some indication that lactic acid is involved [48]. The concentrations of sulfur compounds that result can be developed into fingerprints [28, 38, 39]. Patron use may accelerate deterioration by increasing the rate of S02 uptake on fingerprints and also by exposing the book and making the paper more ac- cessible. Hudson [49] has also investigated the contact pH values of the centers and the margins of leaves in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century rare books in two libraries. The first, the Portico Library, Manchester, England, was de- scribed by Calvert [14] as being badly polluted in 1851. Hudson [49] believes the atmosphere of this library in down- town Manchester has been significantly polluted since the library's founding in 1805. The second, the Chatsworth Library, is located in open country west of an industrial area. The prevailing wind is westerly and the Chatsworth Library atmosphere is not normally heavily polluted. The reproduced con- tact pH values in Table 8 confirm that S02 pickup continues over prolonged periods. These pH values, when com- pared with the test data presented by Barrow [6] in his recent Strength and Other Characteristics of Book Papers 1800-1899, suggest that the folding endurance of the paper in the Portico Library must be very low indeed. Hudson's pH values in Table 8 are considered realistic for paper in books from the collections of urban American libraries. Hudson told me he had ob- tained a contact pH value of 7.0 for the center of a leaf of a copy of Selden's Opera omnzia in the Newberry Library, Chicago. His value, assuming that the pH values for the Portico, New- berry, and Chatsworth copies are comparable, suggests (1) that an alka- line material was providentially intro- duced when the paper was manufac- tured and (2) that the differences be- tween the pH values reflect different storage and use conditions or measuring errors. In a future article, I will report on similar pH findings, as well as other data, for twentieth-century publica- tions from the collections of the Law- rence University Library, Appleton, Wisconsin, the Newberry Library, and The Research Libraries of The New York Public Library. It is likely that many bindings fail because of hydrolytic attack, partic- ularly in the spinal areas. There are no recent data available on the S02 pickup of bindings, but Veitch, Frey and Leinburg [105, p. 161] reported pH extract values more acidic than 1.5 for the spinal leather of books from the John Crerar Library, Chicago, Illinois, The New York Public Library, and several libraries in Washington, D.C. Their belief that these extraordinarily low pH values were caused by S02 pick- up was substantiated by a series of in- vestigations during the 1930's at the U.S. Bureau of Standards, Washington, D.C. The spines of cloth-bound and pa- per-bound books also pick up S02, and their deterioration probably exceeds that which occurs at the margins of leaves. Librarians might find therefore, that the use of a barrier layer, for example, a polyester plastic coating (Mylar), impermeable to acidic gases would improve the life of such cel- lulosic bindings by causing a reduction in the rate of acidic attack. Many archives and libraries purchase acid-free file folders and other storage containers in the belief that their use
PAPER IMPERMANENCE: pH AND STORAGE CONDITIONS 179 will prevent or reduce deterioration. Hansen [44] found wide variation in pH and degree of deterioration across single leaves and between the leaves of a book published in 1576. He concluded that the acidity developed as a con- sequence of the degradation of linseed oil in the printing ink. It would seem likely that the amounts of acidity in a 361-year-old book would have reached equilibrium by 1937, when the book was examined, if the differences in acidity were the controlling factor in acid migration. Barrow [2, p. 105] re- ported on an 1857 pamphlet with a paper cover whose pH was 5.3.

180 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY of the first three pages was 4.5, 4.6, and 4.6, and their folding endurance was 16, 116, and 328. Conclusions might be (1) that the higher alkalinity of the cover did not protect the adjacent sheets and (2) that factors other than acidity are involved in paper deteriora- tion in libraries. Both acid and alkaline migrations occur, but these migrations may be expected to take place with the movement of moisture caused by fluc- tuations in relative humidity. Air pol- lution would be a factor in acid pickup. The acidic gases can be visualized as entering broadside through the leaves of books with permeable covers and having an effect analogous to the de- terioration which occurs at margins. Consequently, archivists and librarians may find that a container with a barrier layer impermeable to acidic gases and moisture would be useful for the storage of manuscripts, etc. Urban atmospheres also contain in- creasing quantities of nitrogen dioxide (N02). N02 forms (1) during the burning of organic compounds, (2) from the combination of atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen at high temper- atures, as in automobile engines, and (3) from the oxidation of nitrogen oxide (NO) formed during (1) and (2). N02 hydrates to yield acid, as for example: 2N02 + H20-* HN03 + HNOs 2HN02-- HNO3 + NO, and if oxygen is present spontaneously proceeds to: 2NO+ O2-+ 2NO2. Nitric acid (HN03) is a strong mineral acid and would efficiently degrade cel- lulose. The primary action, however, of N02 on cellulose is to oxidize the hydroxyl of the No. 6 carbon atom of its anhydroglucose unit to a uronic acid grouping: Cellulose-CH20H+NO2 -) Cellulose-COOH+NO+H20. There are other reactions which occur at the same time in cellulose, but these are not important when contrasted with those mentioned above. Chemically speaking, there is no reason to question the probability that N02 contributes significantly to paper acidity in urban libraries. The forma- tion of nitric and carboxylic acids oc- curs under ordinary conditions when NO2 is present. No catalysts are neces- sary and adequate energy is available at ordinary temperatures. Various air pollution studies offer evidence of the availability of N02 in urban atmos- pheres [9, 87]. The data in Table 9 were provided by the U.S. National Air Sampling Network [96, pp. 24-25]. NO2 may become more troublesome to libraries in the future than S02 is today. There are many efforts being made to reduce the concentration of S02 in urban atmospheres, particularly through abatement legislation. NO2 is formed to a large degree in automobile engines, and our society is only now beginning to talk about large-scale mass transportation systems. Berryhill [9, p. 7] shows that the pollutant-reduc- ing devices under development for motor vehicles do not reduce N02 emission. Librarians ought to be in- terested in removing both NO2 and S02 from library air or otherwise pro- tecting their collections from acidic gases if the aims and financial resources of their libraries include long-term permanence.
PAPER IMPERMANENCE: pH AND STORAGE CONDITIONS 181 THE CONTRIBUTION OF LIBRARIANS Few American librarians in the past have been concerned about the con- sequences of bookstack operations on paper impermanence. Poole's [83, 84] 1881 and 1882 articles on library construction indicate that the upper gallery temperatures of the St. Louis Mercantile Library of 140? F. (600 C.) in summer and 1240 F. (510 C.) in winter were not uncommon. Spofford, as Librarian of Congress, provided an 1881 description of conditions when the Library was located in the Capitol: "If you go into the upper galleries of the Library of Congress on any day in winter and take a book from the shelves, the chances are that it will almost burn your hand" [97, p. 22]. Materials like leather and paper can blister your hand at 1500 F. (660 C.). Poole [84, p. 133] explained further that the skylights proposed for the Library of Congress in 1881 would guarantee summer temperatures in ex- cess of 1400 F. (60? C.) in the upper galleries. Kremer, as Keeper of the Col- lection Emeritus, advised me that ex- haust fans were installed under the skylights of the 1897 main building to force hot air out through side vents. These fans probably limited the in- crease in temperature feared by Poole to a few degrees over the ambient sum- mer temperature, which may reach 1000 F. (380 C.) in Washington. Kre- mer also reported that the skylights over the bookstacks had been covered over with copper roofing to reduce maintenance costs. The areas just under the roof were air-conditioned when the books were removed to make space for offices. The entire building was finally air-conditioned in 1967. The frequent discussions of ventila- tion problems and the consideration of thermostatic temperature control by Cutter [24] at the 1886 ALA confer- ence substantiate the probabilities of excessive temperatures in library stor- age areas. Storage conditions analogous to those cited by Poole probably still exist in some libraries today. Temper- atures on the order of 135-40 F. (57-60? C.) are normal during summer in structures like warehouses and rail- road boxcars which lack proper insula- tion and ventilation. The data provided by Lewis [70] on both accelerated aging and natural aging results were abstracted and re- ported in Table 6 of this article. It is TABLE 9 LEVELS OF NITROGEN DIOXIDE IN CHICAGO, Los ANGELES, AND NEW YORK NITROGEN DioxwDz CITY ~~YEARtS CITY . ...

182 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY interesting to compare Lewis' findings on accelerated aging and natural aging in libraries with those given by Wilson, Harvey, Mandel, and Worksman [ i11 ] in their "Accelerated Aging of Record Papers Compared with Natural Aging" under controlled conditions. The natural aging times were twenty-one and twen- ty-six years, respectively, but the data from Lewis represented the effect of library conditions, and Wilson advised me that their data represented storage inside steel lockers in a dry steam-heat- ed basement at an average temperature of 70? F. (210 C.), ranging from 650 F. (180 C.) to 850 F. (290 C.). The rel- ative humidity of the basement roomn may have reached 70 per cent as a maximum in summer and 20 per cent as a minimum in winter. Temperature changes and particularly humidity changes in the lockers would lag behind the changes in the room. Table 10, "Natural Aging in Libraries Compared with Controlled Natural Aging," is based on index figures. (The nature of the data makes it undesirable to compute quantitative relationships.) Table 10 shows that two papers, A and C, tested by Lewis deteriorate more quickly under library conditions than is suggested by either the accelerated aging test or the twenty-six years of controlled natural aging. Wilson's rag *b and pturified sulfite **b papers are believed similar to the A and C papers used in the Dictionary of American Biography. The fact that both the A and C papers deteriorated more than predicted indicates that a random varia- TABLE 10 NATURAL AGING IN LIBRARIES COMPARED WITH CONTROLLED NATURAL AGING FOLDING ENDURANCE FACTORS CODE ORl Accelerated Aging KIND OF No. oR Original t00?

PAPER IMPERMANENCE: pH AND STORAGE CONDITIONS 183 tion was unlikely. This comparison suggests that permanence predictions based upon accelerated aging tests can be in error if the prediction does not allow for the effect of storage conditions. In other words, the generalization [4, p. 13] that three days of aging at 100G C. (212 0 F.) is equivalent to about twenty-five years of normal storage may be misleading for some kinds of paper and/or potential book life in libraries. The effect of storage in libraries at lower temperatures in other countries has been considered by Hudson [47] and Venter [106]. Hudson, in his 1961 review of The Manufacture and Test- ing of Durable Book Papers, stated: Though the authors do not draw this conclu- sion, it is easy now to see why the pressure for this kind of research comes from libraries in the warmer parts of the United States. They have already found there that many books fall to pieces after about fifty years. In Great Britain, where temperatures are about 100 C. [180 F.] lower, one would expect similar books to last 100-150 years and, as the making of books from paper other than rag is only just about a century old, the main problem may not have hit British libaries yet. That it will do so is reasonably certain and the publication of this book from the Virginia State Library is timely [47, p. 21]. Hudson and Edwards [50] indirectly evaluated the benefits of prolonged cold storage. Their investigation compared the physical and chemical properties of a copy of a 1909 reprint of Poe's Tales of Mystery and Imagination, Every- man's Library edition, which was left in Antarctica from January, 1912, until November, 1959, with copies purchased secondhand in Glasgow and Manches- ter. Their data on pH and folding en- durance are given in Table 11. Certain differences between the copies, such as the above endurance values, are statis- tically significant. The point is whether these differences have application to library storage practices. It is estimated that the book found in Antarctica in 1959 spent one year in Great Britain, two years with Scott's party, and, after it was discovered, six years in the Unit- ed States and/or Great Britain before it was compared with the two secondhand copies. There are many storage un- knowns, for example, how the book traveled through the tropics. Never- theless, let us consider that the book had eight years of normal storage and forty-seven years of cold storage. There is no way to be sure but the original M.I.T. folding endurance value TABLE 11 EFFECT OF COLD STORAGE ON A COPY OF POE'S TaJes of Mystery and Imagination Variables Antarctic Glasgow Manchester Fiber furnish, percentage: Chemical wood pulp ................. 60 60 60 Esparto ............................ 40 40 40 Surface (contact) pH ...... 4.20 4.25 4.20 Folding endurance, M.I.T. 0. 5 kg. tension: MD page edge ...................... 12 11 5 MD page center ..................... 13 8 6 CD page edge ....................... 10 7 7 CD page center ...................... 14 8 8 SouRcE.-Hudson and Edwards 150, p. 27].
184 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY at 0.5 kilograms of tension probably was at least ten and more likely twenty times higher than that found by Hud- son and Edwards [50]. This range is supported by the findings reported by Lewis [ 70] as well as by Barrow's [4] time factor (discussed below) of 7.5 for each 200 C. (360 F.) change in temperature. If the original folding endurance value was, say, twenty times higher, then one might conclude there are no practical differences among the folding endurance values of these three books. There are, as mentioned above, too many unknowns for a definite con- clusion. The two possibilities are (1) that the eight years in normal storage were sufficient to undo the benefit of forty-seven years of cold storage or (2) that some reaction or reactions which control paper permanence behave differently at various temperatures than predicted by Barrow. The present- day condition of the Antarctic copy, considering both of these possibilities, suggests that the recommendation by Williams [110] for cold storage is not a practical answer for books which may be used (or perhaps have been used) eight years out of fifty-five. The com- putations which follow indicate that subzero storage temperatures are un- necessary for any normal function of research libraries. Barrow [4, p. 21] aged a "modern paper" at 600 C., 800 C., 1000 C., and 1200 C. (1400 F., 1760 F., 2120 F., and 2480 F.) under dry ventilated condi- tions and plotted the folding endurance of the paper regressed on aging time. These results were used to predict that a time factor of 7.5 occurred for each 200 C. (360 F.) change in temperature. For example, a paper stored at 80? C. (1760 F.) would take 7.5 times longer to deteriorate from one specified level to some lower level than would a similar paper stored at 1000 C. (212? F.). Librarians are using this prediction to justify low-temperature storage recom- mendations [6, p. 341. Some librarians, like Cutter [24], Poole [83, 84], and Spofford [97], have been concerned about the effects of elevated tempera- tures on useful book life. Few, if any, librarians have been concerned about the effects of minor changes in tempera- ture on the potential life of books. Browning and Wink [ 11 ] used meas- urements of color reversion (yellowing), fiber strength, and folding endurance on four writing papers to justify applica- tion of the Arrhenius reaction rate re- lationship to the prediction of paper permanence. (The Arrhenius relation- ship and energy of activation [subse- quently mentioned] are topics treated under chemical kinetics in physical chemistry textbooks.) Independent, and as yet unpublished, work by Gray [40] on other kinds of paper is in agreement with Browning and Wink. Book papers should, in general, react similarly to writing papers, and the method of Browning and Wink can be used to demonstrate the effect of temperature on paper deterioration. The half-life of a paper provides a suitable variable for use in the Arrhenius equation and has a meaning analogous to the usage for rate of radioactive decay. If, for ex- ample, a paper had an original fold value of 100 folds, the value after the first half-life would be fifty folds, after the second half-life twenty-five folds, and so on. The predictions of paper permanence in Table 12, "Effect of Storage Tem- perature on Paper Permanence," were computed as follows. An ideal, high- quality paper was defined as having a folding endurance half-life of one year
PAPER IMPERMANENCE: pH AND STORAGE CONDITIONS 185 when stored at 600 C. (1400 F.). The problem was to predict the half-life value of this paper at lower temper- atures. The method was to substitute appropriate values into and solve the logarithmic form of the Arrhenius equa- tion: k2 Ea T2-T1 1?910?k l 2. 3 03R T2T, The meanings of the symbols are de- fined in the following sample calcula- tion, where the half-life value at 20? C. (680 F.) is computed: loglo(k2/kl) is the logarithm, base 10, of the ratio of the rates of reaction, k2 at 600 C., and ki at 200 C; E. is the energy of activa- tion, which has been experimentally estimated by Browning and Wink [11] as 30,000 calories per mole; R is the gas constant at 1.986 calories per 10 C. per mole; T2 is the higher temperature in degrees Kelvin, or 3330 K. (2730 + 600); and T, is the lower temperature, or 2930 K. Substituting these values into the Arrhenius equation, we find: logk = 30,000 333-293 logk (2.303)(1.986) (333)(293) = 2.69 . The antilog of 2.69 is 490, and the half-life at 200 C. is 490 times the half- life at 600 C., that is, 490 years. Alternatively, the calculation indicates that the half-life at 600 C. is 0.2 per cent (1/490 X 100) of its value at 200 C. This procedure was used to com- pute the predictions of paper half-life tabulated in Table 12. The half-life estimates given in Table 12 are based upon experimental evi- dence where the same moisture content was maintained at the temperatures of accelerated aging as at 200 C. and 50 per cent relative humidity. Browning and Wink [II] discuss the assumptions underlying the predictions of Table 12. The probable accuracy of the predic- tions increases with increasing temper- ature, because we approach the tem- perature of the experiment. The predic- tions at temperatures below freezing are low because the acceleration in re- action rate caused by water would be TABLE 12 EFFECT OF STORAGE TEMPERATURE ON PAPER IMPERMANENCE AVERAGE STORAGE AVERAGE STORAG: TEmPExRATuR TEMPERATUR PAPER Diff.

(1400 F.) for purposes of estimating half-life at lower temperatures reduced. The data of Table 12 indicate that much of the potential permanence of books is sacrificed when bookstacks are maintained at temperatures in ex- cess of the minimum requirements for staff and patron comfort. The predictions of paper permanence in Table 12 depend upon the energy of activation (Ea) and temperatures of reaction (Ti and T2). The predictions are supported by data from Barrow [4] as well as from Gray [401. For example,
186 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY Barrow's aging rate factor of 7.5 is equivalent to an energy of activation of 26,400 calories per mole when com- puted over the temperature range of 80?-100? C. Using this value and com- puting as for Table 12, the half-life predictions at 250 C. (770 F.) and 200 C. (680 F.) are 110 and 230 years, respectively. These predictions may also be used to adjust Barrow's [4,p. 13] extrapolation that three days of ac- celerated aging at 1000 C. are equiv- alent to twenty-six years of natural aging at 680 F. Barrow's twenty-six- year figure could be reduced to 12 years (X/26 = 110/230) if the average bookstack temperature were 77 0 F. rather than 680 F. It is desirable to pause briefly and mention that the water contained in paper is probably the third most im- portant factor, after pH and storage temperature, in paper deterioration in libraries. Paper contains about 4 to 10 per cent water, depending upon the rel- ative humidity and the paper's furnish and history. About 4 per cent of this water is bound in a relatively tightly held monomolecular layer to the cel- lulose and other components of the paper. This water is not so free to enter into or to catalyze chemical reactions as the other water that the paper may contain. At the 50 per cent relative humidity level recommended for librar- ies, a paper may contain from 2 to 6 per cent additional water bound in more loosely held multimolecular layers. The water in paper at about 20 per cent and lower relative humidity levels is bound in a monomolecular layer. The water in a paper at 50 per cent relative humidity has been reported to accelerate the rate of deterioration during ac- celerated aging by ten times that of a bone-dry paper [11]. Additional useful background on the effect of relative humidity is also available from a num- ber of sources [41, 43, 61, 77, 92, 113]. The usual recommendation of 50 per cent relative humidity apparently de- rives from use studies made by the U.S. Bureau of Standards during the 1930's. Storage at 50 per cent relative humidity may emphasize the current physical properties of a paper at the expense of its future physical properties. The optimum level for relative humidity is a very perplexing question because definitive information is simply not available. More information is needed, particularly below 50 per cent relative humidity. The selection of a relative humidity level for optimum storage is related to the availability of funds. On one hand, the permanence of a paper should improve directly with reduction of relative humidity. On the other hand, air-conditioning systems are expensive to instal and operate. Browning and Wink [11] note that the very number of variables makes it impossible to predict the useful life of books in libraries accurately. The half- life values given in Table 12 can be considered optimistic for storage under the conditions which normally occur in libraries. These estimates do not allow for acceleration in the rate of deteriora- tion caused by wear and tear, buildup in acidity caused by atmospheric pol- lutants and degradation reaction prod- ucts, exposure to light, high relative humidities, and various other factors which a predictive test cannot antici- pate. It is clear, however, that the tem- peratures and relative humidities at which libraries have stored and are storing books are tantamount to a poorly controlled, accelerated aging test for paper. In fact, the half-life values given as years in Table 12 might more
PAPER IMPERMANENCE: pH AND STORAGE CONDITIONS 187 reasonably be considered as weeks or months for the less permanent papers like newsprint and those book papers containing significant quantities of ground wood fibers. Librarians should not be surprised that many books are essentially useless but rather that the majority of books in libraries can still be used. THE COMBINATION OF pH AND TEMPERATURE Thus far, this article has stated (1) that both acidity, as measured by pH, and storage temperature affect the stability of paper and (2) that exces- sive acidity and/or temperature can damage otherwise permanent paper. It would be desirable to predict the effect of a change of pH on the permanence of paper. This and related subjects have received a great deal of attention. A simple formula for pH change, similar to that of the Arrhenius relationship for temperature, has not been evolved. Nevertheless, there are data from which first approximations of the effect of change in pH value on the permanence of paper can be computed. Barrow [3] considered the effect of pH on the retention of folding endur- ance. He assembled data on a variety of papers in his Table 7 [3, p. 471], in- cluding the percentage of folding en- durance retention after three days of aging at 1000 C. (2120 F.) and the hot and cold water extraction pH val- ues. The regression lines of Figure 9 were obtained according to Brownlee [12, pp. 338-42] and indicate a rapid decrease in folding endurance retention with increase in acidity. The data for pH values higher than 6.0 were deleted when these lines were computed, be- cause papers increase in stability as they become moderately alkaline. An increase in acidity of 1 hot extract pH unit corresponds to a reduction of 23.4 per cent in folding endurance according to the regression equation for the hot water line of Figure 9. If considered from the viewpoint of folding endur- ance half-life, the half-life remaining is 53.2 per cent (100-[23.4/0.5]) of its initial figure when the acidity is reduced by 1 hot water extraction pH unit. This figure of 53.2 per cent must be applied with caution, because (1) the extrapolation from 1000 C. to li- brary storage temperatures has not been experimentally justified, (2) three days is a very short aging time, (3) no allowance was made by Barrow for the effect of residual strains on folding en- durance, and (4) the thirty-one papers studied may not represent papers stored in libraries. The line for folding endurance re- tention regressed on cold water extrac- tion pH based on twenty-six of the thirty-one papers is also given in Figure 9, because it has not been conclusively demonstrated which method of meas- uring pH gives the better value for pre- dicting permanence. Only twenty-six samples were considered, because the other five of the original thirty-one had cold water extraction pH values over 6.0. The deletion of these five values contributes to the increase in steepness of the cold water extraction line com- pared with that for the hot water ex- traction line. The retention of folding endurance half-life is 10 per cent, when computed as above, if the acidity is re- duced by 1 cold water extraction pH unit. The joint contribution of pH and temperature to paper impermanence is considered in Table 13. The predictions of permanence were obtained by (1) defining a paper as having a half-life
188 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY of 100 years at a pH of 6.0 and a tem- perature of 680 F. (200 C.) and (2) then varying the pH and temperature to obtain the estimates of half-life. The effect of pH change on half-life was estimated as 53.2 per cent and 10.0 per cent half-life retention for an in- crease in acidity of 1 hot and 1 cold water extraction pH unit, respectively. The effect of temperature change on half-life was estimated according to the Arrhenius relationship discussed in the previous section. The objective of Table 13 is to show both the single and the combined contribution of pH and storage temperature to paper imperma- nence. The half-life predictions are based upon model situations where the only changes that occur are those of pH and temperature. The general pattern of rapid increase in the rate of deterio- ration with small increases in acidity and storage temperature is true to life, although there are differences between these ideal situations and a library bookstack. For example, there are many kinds of paper in libraries, and some of these papers would be more or less sensitive to changes in pH and temperature than the hypothetical pa- per considered in Table 13. Moreover, the interrelationship of pH and tem- perature is not well defined, and their effects were assumed to be independent multiples of one another for purposes of estimating half-life. Even with these objections, Table 13 plainly shows that both pH and storage temperature have contributed to the deplorable condition of books in libraries. The rapid decline in half-life suggests that both deacid- 100_ 80X Hot water (D extraction C: 60 60 L c (tj C0 / old water L) 40 ' /extraction 40U 0 201 I z l 4.0 5.0 6.0 pH of aqueous extract of paper FIG. 9.-The effect of pH on the retention of folding endurance.

PAPER IMPERMANENCE: pH AND STORAGE CONDITIONS 189 ification and air-conditioning are neces- sary if prolonged book permanence is a library goal. An experience in the laundry indus- try is pertinent here because (1) it sup- ports the findings stated in this article, (2) cotton rag papers usually have per- manent properties, and (3) museums are concerned about the many cotton and/or other vegetable fibers which are an integral part of their paintings and wall hangings. In 1931, Wilkie [109] reported a U.S. Bureau of Standards investigation into the deterioration of laundered cotton garments. These gar- ments discolored and developed large holes during the ironing process after they had been dried slowly outdoors on cold, damp winter days in New Eng- land when the SO2 concentration was high. Wilkie found pH values averag- ing about 3.0 for the areas of the gar- ments most severely attacked. It ap- peared that the sulfur acids absorbed from the air were concentrated at the last points of the garments to dry. Wilkie duplicated the above field find- ings by drying cotton toweling under controlled conditions in air containing 1 p.p.m. S02. In closing his report, Wilkie indicated that Phair's [78] 1929 patent probably covered the use of cal- cium bicarbonate to protect laundry from S02 attack; and Wilkie recom- mended a mild alkaline rinse for the final laundry step to help solve this de- terioration problem. SUMMARY This article has considered the effects of excessive acidity and inferior stor- age conditions on the useful life of books in libraries. The relative impor- tance of various factors has been dis- cussed, and it appears that the actions of a single industry, an informal group of people, or a specific chemical are not adequate to explain the rate of paper deterioration in libraries. The causes and mechanisms of paper deterioration appear to be intertwined in a complex fashion, and both manufacturing prac- tices and library storage conditions are TABLE 13 ACTION OF pH AND TEMPERATURE ON PAPER HALF-LIFE (IN YEARS) pHl TEMPERA- TURE (?

The pH or acidity of paper is the most significant cause of paper im- permanence today, because the presence of significant numbers of hydrogen ions accelerates the rate of hydrolytic degra- dation of the cellulose in paper fibers. In earlier times, acidic materials, like alum, promoted paper permanence be- cause they increased the resistance of paper to attack by fungi and insects. It was generally believed that a per-
190 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY manent paper could be more acidic than is considered desirable today. I have traced this change in attitude toward pH by enumerating a number of rec- ommendations and commercial prac- tices formulated since the beginning of the twentieth century. A comparison of earlier pH values with those obtained during a recent study of publications from the period 1900-1949 implied that papermakers frequently supplied paper with lower acidity than was be- lieved necessary for permanence at the time the paper was made. Data from a variety of sources have been presented to document the fact that certain atmospheric pollutants, namely, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, increase paper acidity and thereby contribute to paper imperma- nence. Experimental evidence was pre- sented to indicate that this increase in acidity penetrates throughout the leaves of a book. The effect of temperature is believed to be the second most significant cause of paper impermanence in libraries. Librarians have stored and do store books at temperatures used in accelerat- ed aging studies, and they have thereby seriously damaged permanent papers. The Arrhenius relationship was used to show that even minor elevations in storage temperature are very detrimen- tal to paper permanence. I considered the combined contribu- tion of pH and storage temperature to paper impermanence by specifying the folding endurance half-life of an ideal paper under certain conditions and then varying the pH and the temperature. The procedure demonstrated the theo- retical increase in useful book life which can be obtained by paper deacidification and air-conditioning.
