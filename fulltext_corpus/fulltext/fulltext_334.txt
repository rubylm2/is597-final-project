Information Anxiety from the Undergraduate Student Perspective: A Pilot Study of Second-semester Freshmen Shelley Blundell School of Library and Information Science , Kent State University , Email : sblundel@kent.edu Frank Lambert School of Library and Information Science, Kent State University, Email: flamber1@kent.edu In early spring 2013, a pilot study was conducted at a major public university in Ohio to explore elements of information anxiety (defined herein as a combination of library anxiety and information technology anxiety) among second-semester freshmen enrolled in all iterations of both a traditional and a remedial first-year English course. The Infor- mation Anxiety Scale (an adaptation of Sharon Bostick's 1992 'Library Anxiety Scale') was the pilot study's primary measure. Study researchers wanted to examine which information anxiety elements registered the most statistical significance for respondents. Analysis of results revealed statistically significant findings between elements in the scale and previous research and library experience, sex, and race/ethnicity. This pilot study experience will aid the study's researchers in revising their version of the Infor- mation Anxiety Scale for a larger study on information anxiety, toward understanding specific information anxiety triggers for undergraduate students and informing future information literacy instruction practices. Keywords: library anxiety, information technology anxiety, information anxiety, infor- mation literacy, quantitative analysis, Kruskal-Wallis test Introduction Many and researchers information in science the field in education of library and information science in education have explored different ways that under- graduate students experience the informa- tion seeking process (Bclkin, 1 980; Dcrvin, 1999; Jiao, Onwuegbuzie, & Lichtcnstcin, 1996; Kuhlthau, 1991; Williamson, 2005). Most particularly, many of these research- ers have endeavored to understand more about information seeking from the un- dergraduate student perspective, such as when searches relate to specific informa- tion needs (e.g. looking for information to write an academic paper). Of the literature available on information seeking and un- dergraduate students, something appears to be fairly consistent in the findings, par- ticularly in recent research: undergraduate students experience a great deal of infor- mation anxiety when seeking information in a formal (i.e. library) setting, particu- larly if the process relates to an academic need (Becker, 2003; Gross & Latham, 2007; Gross & Latham, 2009; Kuhlthau, 1991; Van Kampcn, 2004). Researchers in library and information science have dis- covered that such anxiety can be deleteri- ous to both information-seeking and the academic performance of undergraduate students in the long run (Kuhlthau, 1991; Kwon, 2008; Kwon, Onwuegbuzie, & Alexander, 2007; Nicholas, Huntington, Jamali, Rowlands & Ficldhousc, 2009; O'Brien, & Symons, 2007). Despite scholarly awareness of the situation described above, little is known about triggers for such anxiety, or specific areas within the concept of information J. of Education for Library and Information Science, Vol. 55.

262 JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE anxiety that are experienced most strong- ly by undergraduate students. Therefore, there is a need to understand more about specific elements within information anxi- ety that have an effect on undergraduate students so that academic librarians may be more effective in addressing these ef- fects in working with undergraduate stu- dents, particularly in terms of information literacy instruction. This pilot study aimed to build a foundation for further study in the area of specific triggers of information anxiety from the undergraduate student perspective. Study Background and Purpose One of the authors became interested in the role of information anxiety on student performance with information literacy tasks when teaching freshmen students in an orientation class at a four-year state uni- versity. It was observed that many students became anxious about the library orienta- tion portion of the class, and some of the reasons they gave for such nervousness had to do with not understanding how the library and research tools work. Research into the literature on the topic revealed the Library Anxiety Scale, developed initially by Sharon Bostick in 1 992 and further val- idated by Onwuegbuzie, Jiao, and Bostick in 2004. The Library Anxiety Scale has 43 statements about library usage and emo- tion that are meant to assess which areas of the library (e.g. staff, resources, tools, etc.) cause respondents the most anxiety (Onwuegbuzie et al. , 2004). Based on pre- vious adaptations of this measure by other researchers in library and information sci- ence (Jcrabek et al., 2001; Kalbach, 2006; Kwon, 2008; Kwon et al., 2007; Van Kampen, 2004), it became apparent that the potential existed to adapt the mea- sure to be more reflective of information anxiety by including items related to in- formation technology (which students in the author's courses had explained were sources of anxiety for them when per- forming research tasks). The measure could then be used to study information anxiety as a whole among undergraduate students. The Information Anxiety Scale (Appendix 1) contains 12 additional items reflecting the broader area of information anxiety. Literature detailing undergraduate ex- periences with introductory research con- firms that anxiety plays a role in how stu- dents feel about the process. In a four-year national study, Project Information Litera- cy (2012) discovered that adjectives used frequently to describe the research process by undergraduate students included "fear, angst, tired, dread, excited, anxious, an- noyed, stressed, disgusted, intrigued, con- fused, and overwhelmed." The study's researchers believe an appropriate term to summarize these adjectives is 'informa- tion anxiety,' defined here with input from research in the area as a combination of the anxiety a person experiences while using a library and its resources, and the anxiety a person experiences when using informa- tion technology to complete a task, par- ticularly if that task relates to information seeking (Becker, 2003; Jcrabck, Meyer & Kordinak, 2001; Jiao & Onwuegbuzie, 2004; Johnston & Webber, 2003; Nicho- las et al., 2009). This definition is consis- tent with concepts put forth by Wurman, Leifer, Sume, and Whitehouse (2001) in their work exploring the impact of digital technologies, the Internet, and other 21st Century advancements on the information behavior of people in general, but adds specific concerns (detailed below) experi- enced by undergraduate students in rela- tion to libraries and information technolo- gies used in pursuit of academic goals. Originally, focus in library and infor- mation science was on "library anxiety," a term brought to the fore in library and information science literature by research- ers like Constance Mellon in the late 1980s (Kwon et al., 2007). Followed up on by Bostick (1992) and others since then (Gross et al. , 2009; Kwon, 2008; Kwon et al., 2007; Onwuegbuzie et al., 2004; Van Kampen, 2004), library anxiety as a term
Information Anxiety from the Undergraduate Student Perspective 263 is best described as the range of anxiety (fear, nervousness, confusion, etc.) some- one experiences when attempting to iden- tify, define, and satisfy an information need, especially when that person must use the library and/or its resources (such as reference services) to satisfy that need (Gross et al., 2000; Gross et al., 2007; Onwucgbuzic, Jiao & Bostick, 2009; Van Kampcn, 2004). Based on late 20th/carly 2 1 st century additions of information tech- nology to libraries, it is a logical step to include the impact of information tech- nology (from the use of word processing software, to learning how to use academic research databases) on library anxiety in undergraduate students. The combina- tion of information technology and library anxiety in undergraduate students has been studied specifically by Kwon et al. (2007) and Van Kampen (2004), as well as generally by Becker (2003), Jcrabek et al. (2001), Jiao et al. (2004), and Kalbach (2006). However, despite numerous adaptations and additions to Bostick's original Library Anxiety Scale ( 1 992; Jiao et al. , 2005; On- wucgbuzie et al., 2004) to include infor- mation technology components and con- cerns in relation to information anxiety in undergraduate students (detailed above), very few of these studies explain appropri- ately where in their information seeking students believe they feel higher levels of information anxiety, or how they believe this anxiety impacts them during their in- formation search process primarily, and in regard to their academic performance, overall. Previous research in this area puts forth that a link exists between height- ened information anxiety and decreased academic performance (Gross et al., 2007; Grosse/ al., 2009; Kuhlthau, 1991; Kwon, 2008; Kwon et al., 2007; Nicholas et al., 2009; O'Brien et al., 2007; Roscllc, 2009), but what specifically incites or heightens such anxiety is understudied. As was mentioned earlier, the Library Anxiety Scale has been adapted previous- ly by other researchers examining various facets of 2 1 st century information-seeking (computer usage, multimodal research, etc.). For this pilot study, the adaptation added elements related specifically to in- formation technology (both hardware such as computers, and software such as online research databases) and information seek- ing in general, and made sure these ele- ments were consistently worded with the rest of the scale. The purpose of this pilot study was to preliminarily test the adapted scale with a select group of respondents (i.e. all second-semester freshmen in all iterations of a traditional and a remedial first-year English course at a major public university in Ohio) to aid the researchers in exploring ways to strengthen the scale for a larger study in the future. Addition- ally, the researchers examined where sta- tistical significance registered in the pilot study's findings, to inform future research in the area of information anxiety in un- dergraduate students. Literature Review For those who study the information seeking processes of undergraduate stu- dents in the United States, it has been dis- covered repeatedly that uncertainty and anxiety are common factors in the process, as was discussed earlier. It has also been established that when uncertainty and anx- iety are heightened (either through frustra- tion or lack of ability in this area), infor- mation seekers either "satisfice" in their information seeking (i.e. claim satisfaction with minimal or poor resources), or aban- don a search for information altogether (Becker, 2003; Gross et al., 2007; Gross et al. , 2009; Kalbach, 2006; O'Brien et al. , 2007; Prabha et al., 2007). Indeed, anxiety in general is something that has been iden- tified by seminal researchers in the field of the information seeking process as being the biggest impediment to successful com- pletion of information tasks (Bclkin, 1 980; Dcrvin, 1999; Kuhlthau, 1991). In terms of the necessary information literacy and critical thinking skills required
264 JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE for undergraduate students to succeed aca- demically (ALA, 2000), satisficing in in- formation seeking and information search abandonment has been shown to produce negative effects on undergraduate student performance in the short term, and can contribute significantly to poor overall academic performance in the long term, affecting chances of degree completion (Becker, 2003; Gross et al., 2007; Gross et al., 2009; Kwon, 2008; Kwon et al., 2007; Nicholas et al., 2009; Van Kampen, 2004). This is particularly true of undergraduate students enrolled in remedial coursework (Bettinger & Long, 2005; Fields & Hol- land, 1998; Rosei le, 2009). Previously, the information search pro- cess for students in higher education and the anxiety surrounding the process has been studied from the perspective of do- mestic students entering higher education immediately after high school (Becker, 2003; Gross et al., 2007; Gross et al., 2009; Van Kampen, 2004), the perspective of graduate students (Jerabek et al., 2001; Jiao et al., 2004), and the perspective of international students (Nicholas et al., 2009). In these studies, information anxi- ety is a key theme that emerges time and again. Although lead researchers in this field (such as Bclkin, 1980; Dcrvin, 1999; Kuhlthau, 1991; and Williamson, 2005), not all of whom agree, have given various reasons why information seekers like un- dergraduate students experience anxiety or uncertainty in an information search, very little research examines specific factors that either increase or decrease anxiety or uncertainty during the information seeking process. One thing these cited researchers do agree on is that one of the best ways to aid students' academic success is through limiting their various anxieties during the information seeking process. The pilot study described herein forms a foundation for further research in the area of limiting information anxiety specifically by in- creasing understanding of specific causes for information anxiety among undergrad- uate students in general. Methods Consistent with traditional methods of survey data analysis (particularly in relation to the Library Anxiety Index), a quantita- tive approach was taken in analyzing the data collected during this pilot study (Bab- bie, 1990; Babbie, 2011; Kerlinger et al., 2000). As noted previously, the researchers adapted the "Information Anxiety Scale" (found in Appendix I) from the "Library Anxiety Scale" (Bostick, 1992; Onwueg- buzie et al., 2004) to include items in the scale that deal directly with information technology and general information seek- ing. Adaptation of the scale was done in consideration of academic advances made between the scale's original creation in 1 992 and now, as well as accounting for the role that information technology (e.g. aca- demic research databases) plays in the 21st century undergraduate student's research endeavors, particularly when using an aca- demic library. As much as possible, items added to the scale conformed to language already established in the scale, as it was the wish of these researchers to maintain the high reliability and validity with which the original scale measured elements of anxiety (Onwuegbuzie et al., 2004). Added items in the scale are marked with an asterisk. Additionally, where it made sense to amend items to be consistent with what the average academic library undergradu- ate student will encounter, these amend- ments were made as minimally as pos- sible. Amended items are marked with a cross. It is worth noting that some previ- ous adaptations of the Library Anxiety Scale changed only those items relating to mechanical barriers (such as the item asking students about use of copiers in the library) to account for information tech- nology anxiety (Kwon, 2008, Kwon et al., 2007; Van Kampen, 2004). The adaptation for this pilot study chose to add elements dealing with information technology spe- cifically, and left most of the "mechanical barriers" questions originally written by Bostick (1992) intact to retain as much as
Information Anxiety from the Undergraduate Student Perspective 265 possible the high validity and reliability with which the original scale measured (Onwucgbuzic et al., 2004). The adapted scale was created online for web distribution using Qualtrics survey creation software. A link to complete the "Information Anxiety Scale" was sent via university email accounts to all second- semester freshmen at the main campus of a major public university in Ohio, enrolled in (1) College Writing I (traditional first- year English course), and (2) Introduction to College Writing Stretch (remedial first- year English course) during the Spring 2013 academic semester. IRB approval for the pilot study was awarded in January 2013. In line with the research parameters of this pilot study, the university's Office of the Registrar provided the pilot study researchers with the university email ad- dresses for 845 potential respondents (8 1 5 in College Writing I, 30 in Introduction to College Writing Stretch), and respon- dents were targeted via four BCC emails over the course of 10 weeks. No incentive to complete the survey was provided, and participation was voluntary. All respon- dents were anonymous. These researchers acknowledge that lack of incentive to par- ticipate in this pilot study may have con- tributed to the relatively low response rate (125 total responses, with only approxi- mately 96 fully completed surveys - a total response rate of 1 5% and a viable response rate of around 1 1%). Future studies shall seek ways to overcome this pilot study's limitations in terms of low response rate (e.g. targeting larger populations, offering incentives to participate, etc.). Through the data collected, two re- search questions were addressed: (1) Which of the independent variables in the pilot study (i.e. two pre-survey questions and demographic questions), if any, affect information anxiety, and (2) If there is an effect with any of the independent vari- ables; what elements of information anxi- ety are affected? The next section details findings from the data collected from the survey. Findings As has already been noted, only about 1 5% of those targeted for the pilot study responded to the survey, with a viable re- sponse rate of approximately 1 1% (based on wholly completed surveys). The con- fidence interval for the total number of respondents to this pilot study was cal- culated to be 5.75 so, in order to yield a 95% level of confidence in the pilot study, approximately 216 responses would have been required (Creative Research Systems Sample Size Calculator, 2012). However, despite a lower level of confidence for this pilot study, numerous items in the scale still registered with strong levels of statis- tical significance, providing guidance for pilot study researchers in areas ripe for future exploration with a larger sample base, and indicating that the statistical sig- nificance of these items was beyond that which may have occurred by chance alone (Vaughan, 2001). Because the data were distributed non- normally, and especially because the vast majority of the pilot study's variables were ordinal, non-parametric inferential tests were used throughout analysis. Conse- quently, the median becomes the primary measure of central tendency as is recom- mended when conducting non-parametric analysis (Vaughan, 2001). Ideally, repre- sentative samples from both traditional undergraduate students and undergradu- ates in remedial courscwork would have allowed for comparison between the two student groups. However, sufficient re- sponse rates from students in the remedial English course were not obtained. Alter- nate means to gather data on information anxiety from these students, specifically, will be explored in future studies. To analyze the data, the Kruskal-Wallis Test in SPSS was used (because variables in the data set were ordinal), and the nec- essary variable conditions to run a one- way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test were not met (i.e. the existence of a nor- mal population distribution and continu-
266 JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE ous variables [Vaughan, 2001]). Addition- ally, the Kruskal-Wallis test can compare three or more groups of data for statisti- cally significant difference. As the pilot study researchers sought to investigate if any of the independent variables had an impact on specific elements within the scale, the Kruskal-Wallis test allowed for non-parametric, categorical investigation of multi-group variables (e.g. race/ethnic- ity) (Vaughan, 2001 ). Exploring Responses to Research Question 1 The demographic variables which ac- counted for the most statistically signifi- cant differences in terms of individual items in the "Information Anxiety Scale" were sex and race/cthnicity. Other vari- ables from the scale registering statisti- cally significant differences in terms of individual items were preliminary ques- tions Q1 (Before attending [major public university in Ohio], I used the Internet to find information for an academic assign- ment), and Q2 (Before attending [major public university in Ohio], I visited a li- brary to find information for an academic assignment). Exploring Responses to Research Question 2 Statistical analysis for preliminary question 1 revealed that those who had used the Internet to find information for an academic assignment prior to attend- ing a major public university in Ohio were significantly more likely to respond that instructions for using the major public university library's online resources (e.g. academic research databases) were clear, than those who had not (X'', n = 94) = 4. 1 0, p = 0.043). For preliminary question 2, those who had visited a library to find information for an academic assignment prior to attending a major public univer- sity in Ohio were more likely to respond (a) that they could not get help in the li- brary at times they needed it (X2(', n = 95) = 3.94, p = 0.047); (b) they were 'not unsure' about how to begin a search for in- formation in general (X2( 1 , n = 9 1 ) = 3.97, p = .046); and (c) that they were comfort- able using the library (X'', n = 92) = 4.23, p = 0.040). For sex, females were more likely than males to (a) believe reference librarians are unhelpful; (b) be unsure about how to begin their research; and (c) get con- fused trying to find their way around the library; whereas males were more likely than females to (a) feel comfortable using the library and (b) believe good instruc- tions for using the library's computers are available. Specific scores are displayed in Table 1. For race/ethnicity, statistically sig- nificant difference was revealed between race/ethnicity groups in (a) believing there is often no one available in the library to help; (b) how comfortable race/ethnic- ity groups feel searching for information; (c) how racc/cthnicity groups feel about the library as an important part of their school; (d) how racc/cthnicity groups feel about computers in the library being oc- cupied by others; (e) regarding whether or not the instructions for using the library's computers are clear; and (f) regarding how safe a place they perceive the library to be. Specific scores are displayed in Table 2. Tentative examination of the mean ranks between the racc/ethnicity groups of sta- tistically significant items revealed (a) Caucasians were the most likely to be- lieve there is often no one available in the library to help them, (b) Hispanic- Amer- icans felt the most comfortable searching for information, (c) African-Americans were the most likely to agree that the li- brary is an important part of their school, (d) Caucasians were the most likely to be- lieve computers in the library are usually occupied by others, (e) Caucasians were the most likely to believe the instructions for using the library's computers are not clear, and (f) Hispanic-Americans were the most likely to believe the library is a

Further analysis by the authors will explore specifically where differences in these results lie between the identified race groups in the pilot study (Caucasians, African- Americans, Hispanic- Americans, and Other racc/cthnicity background) to inform future research. Discussion It is interesting to note the particular difference between items on the scale and sex. Specifically, findings indicating that females in the pilot study appeared to find reference librarians more unhelpful, reg- istered more confusion navigating the li- brary itself, and be less sure about how to begin a research endeavor (as opposed to males in the pilot study), were particularly noteworthy to the authors. Future infor- mation anxiety research that examines sex specifically may determine if these dif- ferences exist between the sexes for most incoming undergraduate students, and Table 2.

268 JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE if so, what can be done to minimize the difference. Additionally, as stated, future analysis within the race/ethnicity category will establish the exact nature of the dif- ferences expressed between race groups to inform future study directions for this variable. In addition to the inferential findings presented above, analysis of the pilot study's descriptive statistics revealed that although 50% of respondents were mostly sure about how to begin a general search for information, 47.8% respondents agreed or strongly agreed they were unsure about how to begin their research, 62.5% of re- spondents feel uncomfortable searching for information, and 67% of respondents do not want to leam how to do their own research. This means that researchers in the area of information anxiety in under- graduate students should look at both the ramifications of information anxiety on information behavior and the role of moti- vation and willingness to leam in how un- dergraduates conduct academic research. Indeed, motivation and willingness to learn in terms of conducting research may be an area rife with research possibilities, particularly regarding incoming under- graduate students, and students progress- ing through their degree programs. It is speculated by these researchers that lack of motivation decreases for most under- graduate students once they begin focus- ing on specific research areas within their academic majors. Only further analysis in this field will determine whether or not this is actually the case. Conclusion These researchers believe there is great potential for research in the area of infor- mation anxiety between (a) undergradu- ates who have had previous experience with both libraries and the Internet for research and those who have not, (b) sex, and (c) race /ethnicity. Each of these three variables have many opportunities for further exploration in terms of informa- tion anxiety and specific elements within that could potentially reduce information anxiety as a whole if treated with target- ed instruction, both in the library and in classrooms. Additionally, as the quoted descriptive statistics bear out, understand- ing the role of motivation and willingness to leam in the research process as a whole for undergraduate students is worthy of further investigation, toward improving future information literacy instruction that can focus on specific information needs of undergraduate students, particularly first- year undergraduate students. In terms of information anxiety dif- ferences between those with previous research experience and those without, librarians may be able to do more to dif- ferentiate between student abilities (based on whether or not students have previous research experience with libraries and/or the Internet) and thereby cater information literacy and research sessions accordingly, based on the specific information anxiety experienced by both groups. In terms of information anxiety differences between sex, future research could examine wheth- er females in future, similar studies report significantly higher anxiety than males, especially in terms of library and infor- mation technology usage overall. This will allow librarians to explore ways to limit such anxiety differences between the sexes through experimentation with differ- ent techniques in instruction. In terms of information anxiety differences between race/ethnicity, future research could ex- amine ways to minimize information anxi- ety for all races, particularly in the area of library and information technology usage and understanding, with specific methods developed to aid race/ethnicity groups that experience particular types of information anxiety that may not be felt as highly as other race/ethnicity groups (as evidenced in this pilot study's findings). Finally, the authors note that the mea- sure itself may have been problematic for respondents in this pilot study. Although Bostick's (1992) measure tests highly in
Information Anxiety from the Undergraduate Student Perspective 269 terms of both validity and reliability (On- wuegbuzie et al., 2004), adding items that relate to information technology increased the length of the survey and may have con- tributed to many respondents (excluded from analysis) not completing the survey. As a larger, more comprehensive study is planned beyond this pilot study, a revi- sion of the Information Anxiety Scale may become appropriate or, as was discussed previously, larger populations targeted and/or incentives given for completion. However, despite lower than expected re- sponse rates, that numerous items within the scale still registered as statistically sig- nificant is encouraging, and provides pilot study researchers with a solid foundation for future research in the area of informa- tion anxiety.
