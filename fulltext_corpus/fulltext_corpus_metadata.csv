This study was conducted to assess whether student participation complemented or expanded the knowledge and skills gained from the MLIS core through application in an external setting. The knowledge and skills acquired by the students are intended to raise consciousness of critical literacy issues that will enable students to participate in community engagement beyond their MLIS program. Through this study, the authors evaluate a project framework designed to connect student experiences in a training-based project with the core areas of the MLIS curriculum. Preliminary analysis demonstrates potential for the framework to serve as a practical generalization for developing similar basic technology literacy projects that can complement what is taught in other MLIS programs.",A Service-Learning Framework to Support an MLIS Core Curriculum,Journal of Education for Library and Information Science,2011,10.2307/41308890,article,research-article,jstor,,4/1/2011,2,52,http://www.jstor.org/stable/41308890,Dan Albertson; Maryann S.

The results revealed a complex interplay of gender relations in the students' perceptions of the occupational world and their roles within it. The results also revealed an interesting positioning of the job title ""librarian"" relative to other fields. Unlike their assessment of the other occupations included in the study, the students considerably underestimated the level of education required to be a librarian (most did not believe that librarians require a university education). They also underestimated librarians' average starting salary and rated the occupation's social status and future prospects to be lower than the other job titles.

In fall 1994, twenty-one students in an introductory course on communication processes completed analyses of fourteen different electronic lists or newsgroups as their term projects.

In addition, technology topics were frequently discussed, as well as topics related to the library's clientele.

In preparing the next generation of librarians, LIS programs need to be able to groom culturally competent librarians who can serve these broadening communities.

That consensus was, in turn, the result of the general homogeneity of the people involved in the production and purchase of books for children. Agreement broke up in the mid-1960s, when groups heretofore unconcerned with children's books began to see their social and political implications. Enormous changes in the content of children's literature followed with some paradoxical shifts in liberal-conservative positions on censorship.

This paper reports the results of online students' first year experiences and the use of discussion forums to create an online learning community.",Supporting First Year E-Learners in Courses for the Information Professions,Journal of Education for Library and Information Science,2006,10.2307/40323820,article,research-article,jstor,,10/1/2006,4,47,http://www.jstor.org/stable/40323820,Barbara Combes; Karen Anderson,Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE),eng,259,276,,students; online; online learning; discussion forums; forums; online students; anxiety; studying; studying online; confidence,8851,18,284c5376-5c81-4da3-7f2c-a69053b33c64

Activities connect with and reinforce concepts in childrens literature, thereby helping children learn to live books and understand connections between their reading and their lives. For six summers (20092014), Camp Read-a-Rama has provided fully-engaged, week-long themed literacy immersion experiences that seek to turn summer slide into summer stride. The purposes of this longitudinal, mixed methods study were: (1) to ascertain the impact of Camp Read-a-Ramas interventions on helping children develop positive attitudes toward reading; and (2) to determine best practices for literacy skill programming with children in libraries and the communities libraries serve. Findings offer compelling evidence that strategies employed through Camp Read-a-Rama programming positively impacted childrens attitudes toward reading and their interactions with books, a critical step in literacy skill development and improvement. Analysis of parent/guardian evaluations revealed the following emerging themes as perceived impacts of Camp Read-a-Rama programming upon campers: increased love and enthusiasm for reading, improved reading and listening skills, and a belief that camp activities create a deeper understanding of books and vice versa.

Yet although librarians justify information literacy as increasing democratic participation by all citizens, their efforts to improve ""quality control"" of information also threaten to restrict choice in systematic ways. This contradiction results in part from the genealogy of the terms ""information"" and ""literacy,"" terms that share a relationship traceable to an Enlightenment ideology, namely, that reading could transform society by informing its people. But reading's power to transform was also a contested issue for groups seeking political and cultural ascendancy, and reading genres that initially challenged conventional thought evolved into those that buttressed it. In the process, some groups came to be defined as information ""consumers"" and simultaneously excluded from the role of information ""producers."" Strategies that can raise awareness of the assumptions underlying this legacy include critical analysis of language use and envisioning information use as a process that involves all users in both consumption and production.

As the concentration of media power in the hands of a small number of corporate entities increases and as market-driven management imperatives dominate publishing practices, students should possess the skills to evaluate effectively and critically mass media sources such as main-stream newspapers and magazines. To this end, a theoretical framework for understanding mass media news influence is offered. The concepts of agenda setting, priming, framing, asymmetrical selection, binary oppositionalism, and institutional hegemony are explored in a survey of relevant literature from the fields of journalism and communications. A teaching strategy incorporating these concepts is sketched out. The strategy highlights one news event, and compares how different news sources report that event. Through such an exercise, students will be able to recognize how different news frames affect understanding of the topic in question. Ultimately, the successful BI program will be defined by the extent to which students move away from a passive reading of news media sources to a position where they are able to decode the social context of mainstream news production and develop informed and negotiated reading practices.",Bibliographic Instruction and Mass Media News Literacy: A Theoretical Background,"The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy",1998,10.2307/4309247,article,research-article,jstor,,10/1/1998,4,68,http://www.jstor.org/stable/4309247,Juris Dilevko,University of Chicago Press,eng,431,474,,media news; news literacy; sources; agenda; library quarterly; media news literacy; television; dominance mediation; newspapers; coverage,19971,44,284c5376-5c81-4da3-7f2c-a69053b33c64

Some historians argue that the frontier forced the pioneers to revert to a near barbaric stage while it divested them of all aspects of their former cultures. Others maintain with equal vigor that the society which developed on each frontier was very nearly a carbon copy of the settled areas further east, and that the culture of Americans had not been significantly altered by the frontier process. Most agree, however, that evidence testifying to the nature and extent of book ownership provides one means of measuring the progress of culture on the frontier. This paper summarizes the results of an intensive study of this topic on the southern Indiana frontier. Data were collected from a variety of sources, but especially important were county probate records, which often contained inventories indicating books owned by early Indiana residents. An examination of over 2,000 inventories located in sixteen southern Indiana counties produced descriptions of more than 500 private libraries. An analysis of these libraries shows that the pattern of book ownership was not startingly different from that revealed by similar studies of book ownership in the American colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Clearly, books were not impossible to acquire in early Indiana, and a sizable proportion of the estates inventoried in the counties studied contained books.

For librarians to be successful they must be afforded strong foundations in family and community engagement that begin early in their preparation. Yet little is known about the knowledge, skills, and dispositions that librarians need to engage families and communities, and these topics are rarely covered in schools of information and library sciences. The purposes of this exploratory paper are to identify the competencies that librarians need to engage families and communities and to understand promising pedagogical methods for promoting them. Interviews were conducted with 11 library educators at leading schools of information and library sciences within the United States to understand their perspectives on the topics. Results reveal three main goals for the preparation of librarians for family and community engagement: (1) to provide librarians with knowledge of families and communities, (2) to promote relationship-building skills, and (3) to encourage the mindset that librarians are professionals. Experiential and connected learning opportunities are the most promising methods for achieving these outcomes. Findings are discussed in terms of four main recommendations for stronger integration of family and community engagement into existing curriculum.",Preparing the Next Generation of Librarians for Family and Community Engagement,Journal of Education for Library and Information Science,2018,10.2307/90025869,article,research-article,jstor,,10/1/2018,4,59,http://www.jstor.org/stable/90025869,Margaret Caspe; M.

Data were collected in spring 2007 through interviews with nine library administrators and staff, and surveys with twenty-six older adult patrons at the three libraries. Approximately eight hours of observation were also conducted to gather contextual data to supplement the interview and survey data. The seven guidelines laid out by the American Library Association (1999) were used to guide the design of data collection instruments and the analysis of data. One key finding is that these libraries offer few programs and services geared to healthy and active older adults, thus leaving much room for improvement in the future. Interestingly, the libraries still received high praise from the older adult participants, a phenomenon that requires further examination.

Librarians traditionally hail from the humanities, especially English and history. But as current educational attention shifts to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, are librarians reflecting this change? Anonymized data from ALA-accredited graduate programs from the last five years were collected, coded, and classified to determine librarians' educational and disciplinary backgrounds and in what ways, if any, they differ from the past 65 years and from the contemporary US general population. Unsurprisingly, we found that contemporary librarians still hail predominantly from English and history—a stark contrast from the business and health undergraduate degrees earned by the general US population. Backgrounds in STEM fields remain lacking in librarianship, but librarians with undergraduate education in the arts are on the rise, perhaps supporting the creativity, flexibility, innovation, and risk taking necessary in twenty-first-century libraries.","The More Things Change, the More They Stay the Same",Journal of Education for Library and Information Science,2018,10.2307/90025870,article,research-article,jstor,,10/1/2018,4,59,http://www.jstor.org/stable/90025870,Rachel Ivy Clarke; Young-In Kim,Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE),eng,179,205,,social sciences; librarians; librarianship; undergraduate; humanities; professions; degrees; education; library; professions business,9711,27,284c5376-5c81-4da3-7f2c-a69053b33c64

Transforming LIS culture to prioritize social justice values, epistemologies, and frameworks requires multivalent strategies, community buy-in, and shared responsibility in terms of the labor of leading and sustaining engagement with social justice.",Social Justice as Topic and Tool,"The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy",2016,10.2307/26561651,article,research-article,jstor,,1/1/2016,1,86,http://www.jstor.org/stable/26561651,Nicole A.

The purpose of the study is to determine the nature and extent of interest in children's books in the formative period of the ""golden age of children's literature."" Which periodicals covered children's books, and how did their cultural discourse, as revealed through reviewing and commentary, shape the norms and assumptions by which children's books were created and evaluated? Seventy-five literary periodicals were studied for their coverage of children's books in this period. The literary periodicals are drawn from Poole's Index, Nineteenth-Century Readers' Guide, and Wellesley Index. Using reception theory, a branch of reader-response criticism, I construct the contemporary context in which children's books were received-expressed as ""horizons of expectations."" A spectrum of cultural discourse included the following horizons: the treatment of children's books as a commodity; the elevation of children's books as works of art; an emphasis on illustration and pictorial effects in literature; a lack of rigid demarcation between adult and children's literature; a growing gender division; a diversification of the didactic tradition; a continuing debate on fantasy and realism; the romantic idealization of childhood and its literature; attention to the historiography of children's literature; and anxiety about the changing character of children's reading. While these concerns informed the larger history of children's literature, they converged in late Victorian England and America to create a unique climate for the reception of children's books as a body of literature, a field of study, and a form of expressive culture.","Victorian Horizons: The Reception of Children's Books in England and America, 1880-1900","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy",1994,10.2307/4308896,article,research-article,jstor,,1/1/1994,1,64,http://www.jstor.org/stable/4308896,Anne H.

It also describes some useful methods of implementing this framework in the development of user-centered information systems.",User-Centered Design for Information Professionals,Journal of Education for Library and Information Science,2001,10.2307/40324024,article,research-article,jstor,,4/1/2001,2,42,http://www.jstor.org/stable/40324024,Anna Noakes Schulze,Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE),eng,116,122,,centered design; user centered design; usability; cognate disciplines; systems; professionals; usability engineering; science jasis; humancomputer interaction; interface,3656,7,5ba600e5-1e80-4ff3-edf9-458ad76b1059

In broad strokes, this paper identifies the major external and internal forces influencing professional master's education and, in turn, proposes a framework for avoiding potential pitfalls and seizing opportunities in positioning master's programs in library and information science for the foreseeable future. After examining four internal and five external forces affecting master's programs, the paper reviews and then critiques a trio of popular models for responding to these forces. The paper concludes by advancing five courses-of-action aimed at helping LIS program faculty and administrators respond to the external and internal forces acting on their programs.",Positioning Master's Programs in Library and Information Science: A Template for Avoiding Pitfalls and Seizing Opportunities in Light of Key External and Internal Forces,Journal of Education for Library and Information Science,2002,10.2307/40323970,article,research-article,jstor,,4/1/2002,2,43,http://www.jstor.org/stable/40323970,Clifton F.

We examined the school library access gap; namely, the differences in school library characteristics (staffing, books added to collection, schedule, and number of days closed) in schools with various concentrations of students living in poverty. Alarmingly, we found that the students in most need—those attending schools with the highest concentrations of students living in poverty—had the fewest school library resources to draw on.

The study on equity has three objectives: (1) to provide a brief introduction to the LIS education programs and the institutions which offer those programs in Sri Lanka; (2) to analyze critically the equity of the LIS programs; and (3) to make recommendations for improvement. Four principal methods were used to collect the data required for the main research; semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, review of relevant documents, and participatory observations by the researcher. Four criteria, namely gender, income, geographic region and language, were used to analyze the equity of LIS education programs. Findings of the study established that there is a gender imbalance in the LIS programs with 80% to 90% female students, that an income inequity is evident, that there is a severe inequity in the regional distribution and language of the programs.

In many rural communities, public libraries offer support through health information provision; there are also opportunities for engagement in broader community health efforts. In a collaborative effort between an academic researcher and a rural public library director in North Carolina, pedometers and an individualized online health self-assessment program were made available to library users. The activities were adopted enthusiastically. Feedback included encouragement for more such opportunities; some claimed the activities improved awareness and supported healthy behavior change. With minimal investment, rural public libraries can support healthy lifestyle activities.

For generations, the Library and Information Studies (LIS) community has devoted most of its attention to the first, but currently it is poorly positioned to undertake research on the second and third. American Studies, on the other hand, is well placed to address the second and third, but has largely overlooked American public, school, and academic libraries as subjects of study.

For the most part, however, the library and information science (LIS) research community has failed to analyze the deeper meanings of these appropriations or to evaluate their significance for library users, in large part because it has yet to harness the ideas of many critical theorists whose thinking now dominates so much of the discourse occurring in other professions and academic disciplines. This article constitutes a reexamination of the twentieth-century history of American librarianship that is grounded on this thinking.

South Carolina ranks eighth in the nation for new HIV cases, while the capital city of Columbia ranks seventh (Carolina Teen Health, 2012). Education and prevention efforts are needed to raise young adults' awareness of HIV/AIDS issues in order to reduce this troubling trend. To address this need, the researchers and a graphic illustrator worked with incarcerated students age 15-19 in the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice School District, to develop an age-appropriate, culturally-diverse graphic novel on HIV/AIDS, entitled AIDS in the End Zone. Phase I of the project was to create the novel. Once Phase I was completed, Phase II of the project began. During this phase, graphic novel book club interventions were held with young adults in public libraries in Columbia, South Carolina to measure knowledge gains and impact from reading the graphic novel. The purpose of this phase was to examine the role that graphic novels can play as a resource for increasing HIV/AIDS awareness among young adults. Phase II was funded by the 2013 ALISE Research Grant. The findings of the study are reported here.

Virtual communities are unique in making such reading explicit through further acts of writing: participants form their communities through public performances of writing, reading, and interpreting of texts. Any analysis of virtual communities must take into account both the exchange of meaning through texts and the fact of a mediating distance between participants. The hermeneutic theories of Paul Ricoeur can support an analysis of these activities, which accounts for temporal and spatial distance in the exchange of the community's texts.

The Enlarged Program was a major initiative to revitalize library services and to establish ALA as the dominant force in library affairs. Among the proposals were continuation of selected war-related services, closer liaison with other professional groups, new programs of service for adults and immigrants, promotion of library extension, certification of professional education, and constitutional revision.

The key question investigated is how much of the development of a national union catalog is influenced by choices that are not solely technical but that include players' differing visions, the solutions that they feel they need to adopt, the difficulties they may encounter, and their cultural practices.

I take issue with both claims. Regarding social contract theory, I argue that utilitarianism yields nothing to it regarding the types of materials that libraries should offer and who should have access to those materials. As for the Library Bill of Rights itself, I criticize parts of their interpretation and their positions on censorship, access, and paternalism.

This organization, the first of its kind in the United States, promoted independence, patriotism, and self-sufficiency among young girls. This article's focus on the Girl Scout handbooks and the additional periodical literature produced by the organization provides important clues as to the kind of advice Low felt necessary to impart to these girls and the types of activities the organization promoted. Girl Scout handbooks and magazines provide insight into the degree to which the Girl Scout organization (1) promoted feminist ideology to young girls in the early 1900s, (2) expected a woman's sphere to be restricted to the realm of children, religion, and the home, and (3) encouraged women to display independence either surreptitiously or overtly. The Girl Scout handbooks lend insight into the evolving definition of gender roles through the instruction they imparted to young girls. The intended goals of the Girl Scouts, through a study of the Girl Scout literature, will help elucidate the expectations grown women, like Juliette Low, maintained for their youthful counterparts.","American Girlhood in the Early Twentieth Century: The Ideology of Girl Scout Literature, 1913-1930","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy",1998,10.2307/4309227,article,research-article,jstor,,7/1/1998,3,68,http://www.jstor.org/stable/4309227,Rebekah E.

While many perceive gaming as a new library service, gaming services have been part of librarianship since the nineteenth century through chess clubs. During the Great Depression, libraries supported patrons with puzzle contests and developed circulating toy and game collections. Academic libraries built game collections for research and classroom needs, while school libraries collected and facilitated educational games to aid teachers. Video games have been used in libraries to help patrons learn to use technology and to bring groups of patrons together to enjoy shared experiences. The goal of this article is to demonstrate the different ways in which libraries have used games, toys, and puzzles over the last 150 years through both collections and services.","Playing in the Past: A History of Games, Toys, and Puzzles in North American Libraries","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy",2013,10.1086/671913,article,research-article,jstor,,10/1/2013,4,83,http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/671913,Scott Nicholson,The University of Chicago Press,en,341,361,,libraries; gaming; gaming programs; public library; public libraries; collections; toy libraries; patrons; library services; academic libraries,8294,21,a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202

Every place maker must make do, make sense, and make place in an environment that is technologically heterogeneous and in which the potential for novelty as well as recurrence is a persistent feature. The siege flag of place has been raised, not only in librarianship but in many sectors, in defense of the human and the parochial, of tradition and local turf. Taking a phenomenological cue, here we attempt to prune and redirect this problematic term. We arrive at what we consider reasonable criteria of success for ourselves: to what extent is our “library,” in whatever professional sense we assign that word, vitally connected to the discursive practices of the places from which it draws its mandate? We contend that vitalizing a library in this respect requires us to step outside the sphere of our habitual familiarity and to explore other places. How we go about doing this is a matter of methodology.

processed_fulltext_339.txt,fulltext_339,fulltext_339.txt,http://www.jstor.org/stable/4309202,"The issue of user fees in public libraries has been debated extensively in the library community in the last several years. Since their origins in the nineteenth century, American public libraries have relied almost exclusively on public funding. An examination of their nature as public goods, however, reveals public library services to be as much private goods as public goods. This conclusion based on economic grounds is supported by surveys of public opinion toward user fees in libraries, which have typically found the general public to be more tolerant of fees than librarians. In this study, we reanalyzed the data from a national telephone poll of 1,181 U.S. residents conducted in 1991 by the Library Research Center at the University of Illinois. When asked what they would like to see done if their local public library were facing a fiscal crisis, 47 percent of those voicing an opinion favored raising taxes, while 44 percent favored instituting user fees. The remaining 9 percent advocated a reduction in services. We used the framework of discrete choice analysis to determine whether attitudes toward fees and taxes stem more from citizens' own self-interest or more from their political outlook. We found greater support for self-interest as an explanation. In particular, more frequent library use, urban residence, a higher level of education, and greater income were all associated with a greater preference for taxes over fees or service cuts.",Public Opinion toward User Fees in Public Libraries,"The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy",1998,10.2307/4309202,article,research-article,jstor,,4/1/1998,2,68,http://www.jstor.org/stable/4309202,Mark T.

Using naturalistic inquiry methodology, this article reports an empirical study of user-based relevance interpretations. A model is presented that reflects the nature of the thought processes of users who are evaluating bibliographic citations produced by a document retrieval system. Three major categories of variables affecting relevance assessments-internal context, external context, and problem context-are identified and described.

By the 1910s, the clubs were supporting approximately 250 members, publishing a newspaper called the S.E.G. News, and operating an acclaimed art pottery, the Paul Revere Pottery. Under the tutelage of Edith Guerrier, a librarian, her partner Edith Brown, an artist, and Helen Osborne Storrow, their financial patron, the clubs' meetings focused on weekly discussions of literature, economics, politics, music, art, and employment opportunities. Participation in these clubs enabled some of the members to pursue higher education at a significantly greater rate than their cohort, and indeed even that of native-born white women of the time period.

Studies have found, however, that in comparison with male librarians, female librarians tend to publish in disproportionately small numbers. One rationale offered for this discrepancy is that men receive the Ph.D. more frequently than do women (doctorate-holding librarians have been isolated as the most prolific writers). This study tests the hypothesis that men and women exhibit similar publishing patterns if education is held constant at the doctoral level. The population studied is limited to a random sample of library science Ph.D.s who received their degrees between 1969 and 1979. A list of each person's publications was compiled for the five-year period following receipt of the Ph.D. The citations are classified by gender, occupation, and type of publication and authorship. On the basis of this study, the hypothesis that men and women will exhibit similar publishing patterns cannot be rejected. The difference in the number of citations per person for equal numbers of men and women is insignificant. Differences between men and women when comparing type of publication, type of authorship, or quality of articles are also insignificant. There is, however, a significant difference between the number of unpublished women and the number of unpublished men; almost three times more women than men have no citations listed in ""Library Literature."" The hypothesis can be rejected when comparing male and female educators. The difference between mean number of citations per person as well as the difference between nonpublishing male and female educators is highly significant.

At this time the company took the corporate name of the De Vinne Press, surviving as such until 1923.

By making a formal comparison of this popular series with domestic fiction for girls (much of which is now considered “classic” literature), we can establish a tradition in girls' writing more prevalent than perhaps has been thought and can, as we contrast the respective professional receptions of these works, consider how our selection practice is informed by a historically consistent and prescriptive impetus.",Considering Popular Fiction and Library Practices of Recommendation: The Literary Status of “The Clique” and Its Historical Progenitors,"The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy",2008,10.1086/523910,article,research-article,jstor,,1/1/2008,1,78,http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/523910,Amy Pattee,The University of Chicago Press,en,71,98,,domestic fiction; chick lit; massie; clique; fiction for girls; claire; cousin helen; nineteenth; bedroom; century,12420,28,ea8e83db-4157-2f48-80df-c49eca108ccc

He is widely cited and is adapted in various ways that focus on LIS forms of power, discourse, and so on. Others have addressed Foucault's topics, but he remains central. Librarianship has taken up a prior challenge to more fully explore his work, and it is now time to carefully review the implications of Foucault's thinking as a foundation for a critical‐theoretical LIS. Foucault has undergone extensive analysis and critique, and this article is a similar step within LIS. While not comprehensive, a review of Foucauldian ideas within LIS literature from a core group of authors is undertaken. Critiques and problems in Foucault's thinking are reviewed since, by relying on Foucault's insights for a line of analysis and research, this LIS theoretical work will reflect some of those same problems.",Transgression or Stasis?

This article asserts that IL theory radiating from equity requires the animating dynamics that conceptual advances in literacy theory offer. By examining early moments in librarianship to understand librarians' relationship to equity and drawing on Jean‐Luc Nancy's contrasting notions of globalisation (globalization, resulting in misery) and mondialisation (world forming, resulting in a just society) as a framework for reenvisioning IL, I identify new approaches to IL that are particularly well suited to producing more equitable educational outcomes for community college students. Synthesizing concepts from researchers who have applied new thinking about literacy to their conceptualizations about information literacy, I celebrate approaches to IL in which students, critically engaged in creating meaning, are positioned as producers of information.",Information Literacy and Community College Students: Using New Approaches to Literacy Theory to Produce Equity,"The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy",2009,10.1086/599124,article,research-article,jstor,,7/1/2009,3,79,http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/599124,David Patterson,The University of Chicago Press,en,343,361,,community college; students; college students; equity; librarians; literacy; community college students; college librarians; mondialisation; educational equity,7116,19,ea8e83db-4157-2f48-80df-c49eca108ccc

The limited published research on diversity programs in libraries, though, has focused on academic libraries. This article represents the results of a study of leadership diversity in large, urban public libraries. In the study of members of the Urban Libraries Council, data were gathered with regard to programs related to diversity awareness, staffing, collections, and information services. The research results indicate that diversity‐related activities and programs have been implemented in a high percentage of the libraries. However, the level of focus on areas such as retention has not been as consistent, as is the case with the provision of library services and collection development, for example. The research results also indicate the relationship between organizational leadership and administrative structure and activities related to operationalizing diversity in public libraries.",Leadership Diversity: A Study of Urban Public Libraries,"The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy",2007,10.1086/512956,article,research-article,jstor,,1/1/2007,1,77,http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/512956,Mark Winston; Haipeng Li,The University of Chicago Press,en,61,82,,diversity; libraries; percent; organizational; public libraries; library diversity; services; minority librarians; diversity officer; programs,6117,22,ea8e83db-4157-2f48-80df-c49eca108ccc
