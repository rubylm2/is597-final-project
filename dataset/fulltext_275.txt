THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY Volume VI JANUARY 1936 Number I COMMUNITY STUDIES IN READING III. READING HABITS OF ADULT NON-USERS OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY, HELEN A. RIDGWAY F LUSHING, NEW YORK, is a suburban residential com- munity about ten miles from the center of New York City, which can be reached easily and quickly by subway, elevated railway, train, or bus. Although a part of the Borough of Queens since I898, it has had a long independent history and still preserves its identity and its pride in local traditions. In addition to excellent schools, including a large senior high school, Flushing has several very active churches, a Young Men's Christian Association, an armory, and three moving- picture theaters. Some thirty organizations-political, social, philanthropic, and literary-make for a very active club life. Flushing is also known for its places of historical interest and as the home of many prominent musicians, artists, and writers. In 1930 the population was 55,608, but by January I, 1934, the date of this study, it had increased to 63,4oo, according to a reliable estimate. On the latter date, I9,48 I persons, or 32.5 per cent of the population, were registered card-holders at either the Flushing Branch Library, located at one end of the main busi- ' Helen A.

2 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY ness street, or at a smaller branch of the Queens Borough Public Library in a store building at the extreme eastern edge of the community. Near each of these branch libraries there is a book- store with an active rental collection, and many of the drug stores also have circulating libraries. Choice of group to be studied.-Since it has already been dis- covered that distance and accessibility are potent factors which affect library use,2 and since printed lists of names and ad- dresses of voters are readily available from the Board of Elec- tions, the investigation was limited to the registered voters liv- ing in the election district in which the Flushing Branch Library is located. The greater part of this district lies on the side of the library away from the business section of the community, and only one street is more than a quarter of a mile from the library. Practi- cally every resident in the district, therefore, must pass by the library to get to the business section or to any form of public transportation. Furthermore, several social and economic classes and various kinds of dwellings are represented in this area. There are three modern apartment houses varying in size and type, several old family residences, many one- or two-story frame houses, and, in the poorer section, regular tenements. The use of the list of registered voters restricted the study to citizens who were over twenty-one years of age and literate. Many were taxpayers as well as voters, and therefore could be expected to take some interest in a public institution for which they were indirectly responsible. When the names of the 480 registered voters in the election district chosen3 were checked with the names of borrowers registered at the Flushing Branch Library, it was found that only io0, or 2I per cent of the voters had taken out library cards during the three-year registration period just ended, while 379 people, or 78.9 per cent, were not card-holders and were, therefore, non-users of the library in the * F.

Method used to obtain information.-It was decided that the most effective way to obtain information about the reading hab- its of these 379 non-users was through personal interviews. Although often criticized because of the time it consumes, the interview method does afford the opportunity to talk directly with the people, to encourage their comments, to clear up any misunderstandings, and to discover the characteristic attitudes toward the library which go far deeper than mere stated reasons for non-use. By this method, also, the investigator hoped to TABLE I ANALYSIS OF THE 480 REGISTERED VOTERS NUMBER PERCENTAGE Men Women Total Men Women Total Library card-holders ...... 39 62 101 14I1* 30.2* 21 .0* Non-users of the library. .. 236 143 379 85.8 69.7 78.9 Total .............. 275 205 480 0Oo.0t 0oo.0t 100.0t To be read: Of the 480 registered voters, 14.1 per cent of the men, 30.2 per cent of the women, and 2t.o per cent of the entire group are library card-holders. t The slight error in the sum of the items is due to the use of only one decimal. reach many people who would probably ignore a questionnaire. A comparison of the results obtained by the interview method used in this study and those obtained by Miss Kelley4 through the use of questionnaires shows that this assumption was justi- fied, for the percentage of return from the interviews was more than double the percentage of return from the questionnaires, even though the former method was not as successful in procur- ing such personal information as age, amount of schooling, and nationality. The interviews were usually made without any previous re- quest or notice.

In only a few in- stances was information refused. Cards requesting an interview were sent to all persons who had not been reached after three visits had been made to their homes. Whenever the person sought was not at home, the in- formation desired was obtained from other members of the family, if possible, as this method had already been proved suc- cessful in North Evanston.s The results from these secondary TABLE II ANALYSIS OF THE 379 NON-uSERS OF THE LIBRARY Group Men Women Total Grand Total Moved away .............. 25 8 33 ............

A more complete analysis of the 379 non-users of the library is shown in Table II. In all, 225 interviews were obtained, in- cluding i i6 primary and IO9 secondary interviews. Of these 225 people, about one-third were genuinely interested. The other two-thirds were only mildly interested or indifferent, except for a very few who were suspicious, annoyed, or definitely antago- nistic. The length of the interviews varied from five minutes to three-quarters of an hour, but the greater number lasted from ten to twenty minutes, and only twelve took more than half an hour. s W. S.

COMMUNITY STUDIES IN REdDING 5 From the very first it was apparent that only the briefest notes could be taken during an interview, if at all, and these notes were made very casually on the back of the P-slip contain- ing the name and address of the person being located. For pur- poses of uniformity, ready comparisons, and greater ease in tabulating results, an interv'iew form was devised (see Appen- dix). Although in topical rather than question form, many of the headings in this outline were suggested by the question- naires used by Dr. Waples and by Miss Kelley in their studies. As the study progressed, it was soon evident that there were many inaccuracies in the printed list of registered voters. It was found, also, that people were very reluctant to give such person- al information about themselves as age, marital status, amount of education, and nationality. Accordingly, the original regis- tration records kept by the Board of Elections were consulted and data secured on all these points except education. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GROUP STUDIED Sex and marital status.-As Table III indicates, 58.6 per cent of the 225 non-users interviewed are men, and 41 per cent are women. A glance at Table II will show that this proportion of men and women is approximately the same as that found in the total group of 379 non-users previously analyzed. The fact that the percentage of men who do not use the library is greater than the percentage of women is brought out still more clearly, per- haps, in Table I, which classifies the 480 registered voters as either card-holders or non-users of the library. Although only 57.2 per cent of the people in this original group are men, 85.8 per cent of the men do not use the library in contrast with only 69.7 per cent of the women. Similar evidence of the greater use of the library by women had been obtained by both Miss Kelly6 and B. Lamar Johnson.7 Further consideration of Table III will show that 8I.3 per cent of the non-users interviewed are married, the percentage of 6'Op.

In order to discover whether marital status really has any direct bearing on use and non-use of the library, however, additional data are necessary, as there are also a greater number of married people in the original group of registered voters. Significant in- formation on this point has already been supplied by Mr. John- son in the study just mentioned. He found that while sex has little influence on the number who read newspapers and maga- TABLE III NON-USERS OF THE LIBRARY ACCORDING TO SEX AND MARITAL STATUS Group Number Percentage Single men ........1........

Among the men, however, marital status has no influ- ence on the percentage of those who read books, magazines, or newspapers.8 Closely related to these facts is Mr. Johnson's further discovery that women use the public library, which em- phasizes the reading of books, more than men, and also that single women use it more than married women.9 Age groups.-In Table IV, the non-users of the library have been classified according to age groups-each group, except tlle first, covering a range of ten years. Since all of the people being studied are registered voters, there is no one less than twenty- IIbid., p. 36. '9 Ibid., pp. 42-43.
COMMUNITY STUDIES IN READING 7 one years of age. Three men in their seventies, as well as one man over eighty years old, have been included in the group of people "over 6o." The fact that over a third of the women merely gave their age as "over 2I," when they registered to vote, naturally affects the accuracy of the other figures in the table. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that over half of the total number of men and women are in either their thirties or forties. Since it is the older women, usually, who decline to give their exact ages, i 6 per cent is probably a reliable figure for the propor- TABLE IV NON-USERS OF THE LIBRARY ACCORDING TO AGE NUMBEL PERCENTAGE AGE GROUP _ _ Men Women Total Men Women Total 20's .20 i6 36 15.1* 17.2* i6.0* 30's ......... 34 19 53 25.7 20.4 -23.5 40 s. 40 I8 58 30.3 19.3 25.7 50'S..... . . .... 25 6 31 183.9 6.4 13.7 Over 60o... .

If seventeen is accepted as the earliest age at which most of these people left school, it has been only from four to thirteen years since they finished their formal education. That this group of non-users is not larger is doubtless owing to the increased efforts, in recent years, of both the high school and public library to foster read- ing habits that will last over into adult life and also to co- ordinate their programs so that library use will not cease at graduation. The idea that reading is essentially confined to the school years is still prevalent, however, as shown by such frequent comments as:
8 THE IJBRARY 9,UARTERLY The library is all right for people in school but has nothing to offer adults. I never read, but the children go to the library; it helps them with their home work. My daughter reads but she is still in school. She graduates in June and won't need the library any more. I suppose that the younger men who are still in school use the library, but I don't have time now. When I get old and can't go out maybe I'll do some more reading again. Occupational groups.-For the purpose of comparison the non- users interviewed have been classified in Table V according to the occupational groups used by Miss Kelley in the Woodside TABLE V NON-USERS OF THE LIBRARY ACCORDING TO OCCUPATION NUMBER PERCENTAGE OCCUPATIONAL Gzoup __ Men Women Total Men Women Total Teachers.. . 3 5 8 2.2* 5.3* 35* Other professions .........

Those who are temporarily out of workL are listed under their usual occupation. library survey. Over 3 per cent of the group are teachers, and members of other professions make up approximately 7 per cent. "Other professions" as listed account for fifteen people- a dentist, a writer of business stories, an interior decorator, two engineers, two doctors, two nurses, two musicians, and four lawyers. The homekeepers include both the housewives and a few paid housekeepers and constitute the largest single class of non- professional workers. Although only 22.6 per cent of the entire group, they account for 54.8 per cent of the women. Over SS per cent of all of the people interviewed, however, belong in the
COMMUNITY STUDIES IN READING 9 "other non-professional" group. These are the secretaries, clerks, merchants, storekeepers, business men, salesmen, fire- men, policemen, chauffeurs, electricians, janitors, and other skilled and unskilled workers. In this study, the term "unemployed" has been used to cover only the people who have retired or who are regularly dependent upon others. Those who are temporarily out of work have been listed under their usual occupation. It would seem that the I2 per cent represented in this group would surely have ample leisure for reading, yet many of them gave "no time" as their reason for not using the library. Miss Kelley found a similar distribution of occupation among the non-users of the library in Woodside,Io although her classifi- cation included also a large number of students, a group not represented in this study primarily because of the minimum age limit of twenty-one years. If the students are excluded from consideration and the remaining non-users are analyzed by oc- cupation, it is found that 8 per cent of the group are teachers, i6 per cent belong to other professions, over i8 per cent are homekeepers, and 48 per cent make up the "other non-profes- sional" group. It would seem rather conclusive, therefore, that the majority of non-users of the public library are either home- keepers or other non-professional workers, and that the latter make less use of the library than any other occupational group. Education.-When questioned concerning their education, or even merely asked to state the number of years of schooling they had completed, the people interviewed were reluctant and occasionally even hostile. Because of the antagonism thus aroused, the question was kept subordinate and was asked only when a direct lead was given by the person himself. In most in- stances, however, the general educational background became evident during the course of the conversation. It was estimated that at least so per cent of the i i 6 people with whom primary interviews were obtained are either high-school graduates or have completed several years of high school, and 20 per cent more gave evidence of some college training. On the other hand, lO Op. cit.
10 THE LIBRARY tUARTERLY the remaining 30 per cent had very definitely not gone beyond the elementary school. The approximate accuracy of this estimate is supported by Miss Kelley's findings in Woodside.", She found that of the I77 non-users of the library, 46.3 per cent were high-school students or graduates; nearly 30 per cent had gone on to college or pro- fessional schools; and about 20 per cent had only an elementary- school education. That the percentages in the last two groups should be exactly reversed in the present study is probably be- cause of the number of Negroes and Italians among the non- users interviewed in Flushing. Country of birth.-It might well be supposed that a large number of the non-users of the public library are foreigners and so are handicapped in their use of the library by difficulty with the language or by unfamiliarity with American institutions. On the contrary, Table VI shows that over three-fourths of the 225 non-users interviewed are native born. To be sure, many of them are of foreign parentage, but practically all have been brought up in the United States and have been educated in American public or private schools. Furthermore, five of the other twelve countries represented are English-speaking coun- tries; namely, Ireland, England, Scotland, Canada, and New- foundland. Inquiry concerning the naturalization date of each of the foreign-born citizens revealed the fact that the earliest date is I892 and the most recent, 1933. Inasmuch as the law requires that no alien shall become a citizen until he has resided within the United States for five years, every one of the foreign-born citizens interviewed must have lived in this country for at least that length of time. The range was from five to forty-six years, So per cent of the group having lived here fifteen years or more. Italy heads the list of the non-English-speaking countries, with seventeen representatives. That it is harder to interest Italians in books and in the public library than almost any other nationality has already been pointed out by May M. Sweet in t op. cit.
COMMUNITY STUDIES IN READING II an article written some years ago." It should be noted, also, that twelve of the native-born Americans are Negroes. Like the Italians, members of this race have lagged in the appreciation of TABLE VI NON-USERS OF THE LIBRARY ACCORDING TO COUNTRY OF BIRTH Country of Birth Number Percentage United States .......... 75* 77-7t Italy ....... 17 7 5 Germany .............. 7 3.

In their case, however, a more serious hand- icap has been a strong racial prejudice against Negroes through- out the community, which has limited their educational oppor- tunities and has made them feel unwelcome at the library. CHARACTER AND SOURCE OF MATERIAL READ AND PREFERRED Since much of the foregoing information about the general characteristics of the non-users of the library was obtained from the records of the Board of Elections, the interviews themselves were devoted more especially to the character and source of material read and preferred, as well as to the factors related to non-use of the library. The forms of material most frequently read and the forms preferred are analyzed in Tables VII, VIII, 1"Italians and the public library," Library journal, XLIX (November I S, 1923), 97980.

Since most of the people read more than one form of material, they were also asked to state their preference, if any. On this point the data from the primary interviews are believed to be more reliable than that from the secondary interviews, and the results from the two groups are analyzed separately in Tables VIII and IX.
COMMUNITY STUDIES IN READING 13 Of the i i6 people who were questioned directly 45.6 per cent said that they preferred to read newspapers, 24.1 per cent pre- ferred magazines, and only I0.3 per cent preferred books. Over io per cent expressed no preference between newspapers and magazines but specified that they preferred both to books. The 7 per cent who claimed to have no preference at all included both casual and omnivorous readers, and so represent both in- difference and catholicity of taste.

Similar conditions were revealed by inquiries about the other IO9 non-users. Over 57 per cent of the latter were said to prefer newspapers, about 9 per cent were said to prefer magazines, and only about 6 per cent to prefer books. Once more over io per cent were thought to prefer newspapers and magazines to books, and for about the same proportion of the group no preference was known. The most significant discovery for the library is that in both groups 8o per cent of the people prefer either news- papers or magazines, or both, to books! Newspaper reading.-Although the percentage of men who prefer newspapers to other forms of reading material is much higher than that of women, it would seem from the percentages in Table X that sex has no bearing on the actual reading of
14 THE LIBRARY TUARTERLY newspapers, the conclusion already reached by Mr. Johnson.'3 Various reasons for this discrepancy between preference and ac- tual reading were given by the people interviewed. Almost everyone pointed out that because of the accessibility and low cost of newspapers, they can be bought easily, read quickly, and then discarded. Several people also mentioned in- ducements offered by newspapers to those who become regular subscribers, such as the insurance policies connected with the Long Island star. Others said that with so many things happen- ing in the world today, everyone has to read a daily paper TABLE X NON-USERS OF THE LIBRARY AND THE READING OF NEWSPAPERS Analysis by Sex NUMBER PERCENTAGE FREQUENCY _ Men Women Total Men Women Total Regularly.

In short, the general attitude toward newspaper reading.is summed up in the frequent comment, "Well, I don't have any time to read. Of course, we take several newspapers, but as for real reading. " Indeed, it was found that very few people limited their newspaper reading to one paper a day; sixty-seven people reported that they read at least two daily papers, forty-two people read three, and twenty- three people read four. When more than one paper was report- ed, the selection usually included both a morning and an eve- ning paper, a local and a metropolitan paper, or papers devoted primarily to news in contrast with others that emphasize vari- '3 Op. cit., p. 36.

Occasionally, however, the selection was limited to the same general type of newspaper, but represented the specific titles preferred by different members of the family. The titles of local and metropolitan newspapers read by six or more people are given in Table XI. The strong interest in lo- cal affairs is demonstrated by the fact that over 64 per cent read either the North Shore journal or the Long Island star. The for- mer is more popular because it is published in Flushing and em- TABLE XI LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN NEWSPAPERS READ BY SIX OR MORE PEOPLE* NUMBER PERCENTAGE TITLE -_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _-_ _ _ _ Men Women Total Men Women Total Local: North Shore journal. . 51 63 I14 38.6t 67.7t So.6t Long Island star .9 22 31 6.8 23.6 13.7 Metropolitan: New York times. 27 25 52 20.4 26.8 23.1 Herald-tribune .28 23 5I 21 .2 24.7 22.6 Daily news ............. 29 14 43 2I.9 15.0 I9.

The inducement which has led some people to substitute or to include the Long Island star has been mentioned. It will be noticed, also, that the preference for local news- papers is due especially to the women, most of whom are house- wives and spend the greater part of their time in Flushing. The men, on the other hand, who commute to their work in Man- hattan every day, tend to favor the metropolitan papers. The reading of newspapers known to be printed in a foreign

Two other people reported that they read only the Jewish news- papers, some of which are printed in Yiddish and some in English. Magazine reading.-As in the case of newspaper reading, the percentage of non-users of the library who actually read maga- zines is much larger than the percentage of those who prefer them to newspapers or books. At least two reasons were ad- vanced to account for this discrepancy. In the first place, many who prefer to read newspapers do, nevertheless, read some TABLE XII NON-USERS OF THE LIBRARY AND THE READING OF MAGAZINES Analysis by Sex NUMBER PERCENTAGE FREQUENCY- ___ - ___- ___- Men Women Total Men Women Total Rcgularly ................ 66 65 131 5o. o* 69.8* 58.2* Occasionally ... 4 0 4 3 .0 0.0 1.7 Never .62 27 89 46.9 29.0 39.

It will be seen later that lack of time is one of the most frequent reasons given for not reading and hence for not using the library. Further analysis of magazine reading in Table XII shows that magazines are read more frequently by women than by men. In fact, nearly So per cent of the men reported that they never read magazines, in contrast with about 30 per cent of the women. It must be remembered, however, that more than half of the women are homekeepers and therefore have more opportunity during the day to read magazines than do the men. In reply to the question as to how many magazines are read, the number
COMMUNITY STUDIES IN READING 17 varied from a minimum of one title to a maximum of twelve, but the majority reported that they read from one to three titles regularly. The titles of all magazines read by twelve or more people have been given in Table XIII. The Saturday evening post, which leads the list, appeals particularly to the men. A close second is the Cosmopolitan, equally popular with both men and women, as is also the Literary digest. Catering particularly to the women are Good housekeeping, Delineator, Woman's home companion, and Ladies' home journal.

Of the better-class magazines, the Atlantic monthly was men- tioned by one person, Harper's by four people, the National geographic by four, and Scribner's by two. Four people named the Reader's digest. Magazines reported by readers who had some specific interest or hobby were A4merican home, Decoration, Equity, Fleetowner, Homes and gardens, Industrial finishing, Kennel magazine, New masses, Popular mechanics, Radio guide, and Sport. The reading of books.-The implication of the fact brought out in Table XIV-that 56.8 per cent of the non-users of the library never read books, and another 13.7 per cent read them only occasionally-is very important to the library. During each in- terview, an attempt was made to discover any characteristic
I 8 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY attitudes toward books and reading which would explain this situation.

The first attitude to be discovered was indifference toward reading, coupled with self-satisfaction. It was brought out by such comments as the following: You'll find I'm not much of a reader [by a motion-picture operator]. I'm not much of a hand to read a book [by the publicity agent of a women's political club]. I ain't never read a book yet, and I ain't a-going to start now, and as for my wife, she'd die first [by an apartment-house superintendent]. Reading! Why, I read the classics long ago [by a seamstress]. The idea that reading is a task came next. This time, two less belligerent superintendents said, "I never read a book, I can't see what people see in it," and "No, I never read books, I don't get any pleasure out of it." A telephone clerk and housemaid agreed that they didn't care about reading; they couldn't seem to get down to it; and a husband and a father each explained proudly that his wife or his children did the reading for the family. That the reading of books is a luxury to be given up when more important matters present themselves is a very prevalent attitude. "The library doesn't mean anything to me, but have you some good books for the boys? I want them to read now while they can," one father exclaimed. "I used to read, but I
COMMUNITY STUDIES IN REaDING I9 haven't read a book now for a long, long time," explained an electrical substation operator. Or again, "I haven't touched a book in ages," said a worried salesman, "there has been too much on my mind." And a tired mother added wistfully, "I used to read a great deal before the children came." These ex- pressions of opinion recall the similar comments quoted in con- nection with the use of the library during the school years.'4 Of the ninety-seven non-users of the library who reported that they read books either regularly or occasionally, fifty-three belonged to the group with whom primary interviews were ob- tained. When these fifty-three readers were asked to name sev- eral books read recently and enjoyed, only twenty-five of them could remember the title of even one book! Seven recalled the names of two books; one remembered three books; two remem- bered four books; and two others, five books. One enterprising woman mentioned twelve titles of current books she had just read and wanted to discuss their contents. In addition to the number of people who were able to recall titles of books, twenty-five more mentioned favorite authors, or types of books preferred when they had time to read. In the end, there were still three book readers who could give neither title, author, nor type of books read or preferred! Inquiries about books read by the forty-four people for whom secondary interviews were obtained, revealed similar conditions, but the results were not sufficiently reliable to warrant further analysis. The twenty-five readers who could remember the names of the books they had read mentioned forty-six different titles. As might be expected, fiction led the list with-twenty-seven titles, which, for the most part, reflected the interest in current best sellers. Mr. Allen's Anthony Adverse was cited by ten people, Mrs. Buck's The good earth and Mr. Merejkowski's Leonardo da Vinci by two. No other novel received more than one vote, but some representative titles were The magnificent obsession (Douglas), The farm (Bromfield), The unforgotten prisoner (Hutchinson), Mutiny on the Bounty (Nordhoff and Hall), One x4See p. 8.
20 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY more river (Galsworthy), Magnolia Street (Golding), House under the water (Young), Oilfor the lamps of China (Hobart), and As the earth turns (Carroll). The only mystery stories reported were The Siamese twin mystery (Queen), and The album (Rine- hart). Somewhat older books cited were Sinclair Lewis' Arrow- smith and Dodsworth, Ford's Jfanice Meredith, George Eliot's Mill on the floss, and Lover's Jack Hinton, guardsman. Next to fiction in popularity were biography and books on health, each with four titles, while the other books fell into the fields of travel, religion, social and economic problems, politics, and literature. Authors named by readers who could not remember individu- al titles were: Grace Livingston Hill Lutz, Ruby Ayres, Mar- garet Pedler, Kathleen Norris, Thorne Smith, Gene Stratton Porter, Zane Grey, Rafael Sabatini, E. Phillips Oppenheim, Sophie Kerr, Mazo de la Roche, Louis Bromfield, Louise Jordan Miln, and Pearl Buck. The first six authors, who specialize par- ticularly in quantity production of sentimental romances, are extremely popular among the women, while the men favor the writers of adventure and mystery stories. The last five authors mentioned were enjoyed by both men and women. Table XV shows the general types of books preferred by the fifty-three readers of books from whom direct information was obtained as distinguished from the titles actually read, which have already been discussed. As before, fiction and biography head the list, the former being much more popular with the women, and the latter with the men. One-third of the men liked books on business and technology-subjects that were not men- tioned by the women-although several of them were in busi- ness. On the other hand, books on travel, art, and music were preferred by the women only. The women also showed a strong- er leaning toward religion, but their interest in history and poli- tics was almost exactly counterbalanced by the men's concern over current economic and social problems. The term "other types" includes such diverse interests as drama, poetry, literary criticism, ex-kings and the development
COMMUNITY STUDIES IN READING 21 of civilization, books by Negroes or about Negroes, and books dealing with the occult. It was much more difficult to find out what factors influenced these fifty-three readers in their selection of books, but some influence, however slight, was noted in forty-six cases. Accessi- bility was the main factor indicated by ten people who said they read the books already lying around the house, books brought home by others, or rental books brought to their desks at work. Ten others-a teacher, a musician, a nurse, an interior decora- TABLE XV TYPES OF BooKs PREFERRED BY FIFrY-THREE NON-USERS WiHO READ BOOKS* Analysis Based on the Primary Interviews Only NUMBER PERCENTAGE TYPE- -_ _ _ _ _ _-_ _ _ Men Women Total Men Women Total Fiction .

Religious interests de- termined the only reading of an Irish landlady, a Christian Sci- entist, and two Negroes; and an absorbing interest in radio and communism governed the nature of one young man's reading. Several people said that they chose their books by browsing in rental libraries and bookstores; others mentioned reading book reviews, or hearing them over the radio; three people followed book-club selections and lists of best sellers, and one person de- pended entirely on the recommendations of acquaintances.
22 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY Sources of material read.-In general, it was reported that newspapers are obtained entirely from the newsstands, but a few people have papers delivered to the house. Magazines are also purchased from the newsstands by more than a third of the people interviewed; the other two-thirds receive most of their magazines by subscription. In analyzing the sources from which books are obtained, in- formation about the entire group of ninety-seven readers of books has been considered as a whole, since the data from the TABLE XVI SOURCES FROM WHICH BOOKS ARE OBTAINED BY ALL THE NON-USERS WHO READ BOOKS NUMBER PERCENTAGE SOURCE -_ _ _ _-_ _ _ _ _ _ _ Men Women Total Men Women Total Flushing Branch Library... 35 34 69 70.ot 72.3f 7VAlt Other branches$ .......... 0 I 1 0.0 2.1 1.0 New York Public Library. . 9 4 13 i8.o 8. 13.4 College library .3 0 3 6.o 0.0 3.0 Special library.

The classification of these sources in Table XVI shows that over 30 per cent of all who read books use the New York Public Library, their college libraries, or other special li- braries in Manhattan. This fact is not surprising when it is re- membered that the majority of these people commute to Man- hattan every day and that most of the men read only books con- nected with their particular line of work. In addition to the New York Public Library, other specific libraries mentioned are the Mercantile Library, the Engineering Societies Library, the
COMMUNITY STUDIES IN REdDING 23 Metropolitan Museum Library, the library of the American Dental Society, and other special libraries maintained by insur- ance companies, dealers in antique furniture, and communist societies. The use of rental libraries is favored by over 50 per cent of the women because of the promptness with which new fiction titles can be obtained. On the other hand, over 4o per cent of the men indicated that they prefer to buy books and read them at their leisure instead of having to finish and return them within any specified time. Of the women, also, nearly 40 per cent buy some of their books, but only a small percentage of either sex belong to book clubs. The most significant discovery, however, is that 70 per cent of both the men and the women who read books are making indirect use of the Flushing Branch Library, although they are not card-holders and so, technically, have been considered non- users of the library. In order to explain this interesting situ- ation, each of the people interviewed was asked whether he had ever used the Flushing Branch Library and also whether any member of his family had a library card. The analysis of their replies has been included in the discussion of the non-users and the library, which immediately follows. NON-USERS AND THE LIBRARY Contact with the library through other members of the family.- As indicated in Table XVII, more than one hundred people, or 46.2 per cent of the library non-users interviewed, reported that there were no library cards in the family. Cards held by chil- dren under sixteen years of age were found in thirteen families, but adult library cards were reported by only ninety-seven peo- ple. The frequent assumption that the wives take out library cards and then the husbands use them does not seem to be valid in this instance, for the percentage of men and the percentage of women who reported no cards in the family is very nearly the same. Moreover, it can be seen later from Tables XVIII and XIX that only twenty-one of the ninety-seven people who re-
24 THE LIBRARY tUARTERLY ported adult cards in the family are using them, and only fifteen more read the books brought home from the library by others.

Previous or indirect use of the library.-The data from the pri- mary and secondary interviews on previous or indirect use of the library have been summarized in Tables XVIII and XIX, already referred to. Of the I i6 people questioned directly, only
COMMUNITY STUDIES IN REA4DING 25 37 per cent have ever used the library, while inquiries about the other IO9 people revealed that only 23.8 per cent are known to have used it at any time. A more detailed analysis of the primary interviews, in Table XVIII, brings out the different ways in which the library has been used by those who, technically, are considered non-users. Previous use of the library was indicated by twenty-two people, and indirect use at the present time by fifteen others.

Of the first number, twelve reported that they had used the library in former years before they became too busy to read books; three said that they used to go in with friends occasion- ally to get books; one mentioned using the library for browsing, and six others stated that they used it primarily for reference, material. Of the number who are using the library regularly, on the other hand, five are reading library books brought home by other members of the family, and ten are using family cards. The six non-users who claim to have library cards of their own include four people whose cards expired more than three years ago, one person who has applied for a card since the records
26 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY were checked at the library on January i, 1934, and another person whose application'for a card has just been renewed. Substantially the same conditions are shown in the analysis of the secondary interviews in Table XIX, although in this latter group the proportion of people who are reading books brought home by others or who are using family cards is greater.

More than So per cent of the group claimed that they had no time to read, the number of women who gave this reason exceeding the number of men by about i 5 per cent. Other ways in which these people spend their leisure time will be discussed later. For the moment it is sufficient to recall that they at least read the daily newspapers and many of them also do some magazine reading. The second reason most frequently offered for non-use of the library was the very frank statement, "I do not like to read." Nearly 30 per cent gave this explanation-the men much more frequently than the women. Another i S per cent specified that they do not like to read books. Moreover, although they are supposed to have given proof of literacy before registering to
COMMUNITY STUDIES IN READING 27 vote, four of the Italians interviewed stated that they cannot read either English or their native language! Twenty-five per cent of the group gave as a third reason for non-use of their local library the use of other sources. It will be remembered from the discussion of Table XVI that these sources include other public libraries, college or special libraries, rental libraries, book clubs, purchase, borrowing from friends, gifts, and private libraries in the home. After "no time to read," "do not like to read," and "other sources," the fourth reason reported for not using the library was the inadequacy of the library itself. This explanation was given by over i6 per cent of the group questioned, and by ap- proximately the same number of men as women, the principal point of attack being the book collection. Several people com- plained that the library never has any new books, or more par- ticularly, no new fiction; a few gave specific titles that they could not obtain; others cited various subjects upon which the library had been unable to furnish books; and at least four peo- ple had the general impression that the library never has any- thing wanted, although they admitted that they had never been in to inquire. Closely related to the adequacy of the book collection, but more particularly concerned with the service of the library, were the further complaints that the library is too slow in get- ting new books, that there are not enough copies of popular titles, that the books wanted are always out, that library books are torn and dirty, that library hours are inconvenient, and that there is too much red tape in library records. In fairness it should be pointed out, perhaps, that the Flushing Branch Li- brary, like all of the other branches of the Queens Borough Pub- lic Library, had no regular appropriation for books for several years and so had to depend upon its rental collection for both recent books and the replacement of older books. The only reasons given for non-use of the library in addition to those mentioned above were the indirect use of the library previously discussed and physical handicaps, including illness, poor eyesight, and old age. It is of interest that nearly 9 per cent of the group reported such handicaps to reading.
28 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY All of the explanations offered were accepted at their face value, and no attempt has been made to check their validity with more objective data. It is interesting, however, to compare these replies with those recorded by Mr. Johnson in the article on adult reading interests already mentioned. He reports that statements from 866 men and women revealed that only one- third of the entire group use the public library, and adds: The chief reasons given for not using the library were "no time" and "not in- terested." These two reasons were given by about three-fourths of those not using the library. Thirteen per cent stated that they do not use the library because they have books available without going to the public library. Six per cent failed to give any reason for not using the library, and 8.S per cent indicated a number of miscellaneous reasons.'s INTERESTS CONFLICTING OR COMPETING WITH READING Since lack of time for reading was the reason for non-use of the library most frequently given, inquiries were made concern- ing interests conflicting or competing with reading. The activi- ties indicated in Table XXI, therefore, are those which the people themselves felt to interfere most with their reading. Of the II6 people with whom primary interviews were obtained nearly 63 per cent confessed that the radio is the one interest that interfered most with their reading. The popularity of the radio was carefully explained by many of the people inter- viewed. Once more, accessibility plays a large part, for, as sev- eral people pointed out, the radio is always there, with a new program, whereas books have to be replenished. Then, too, it requires so much less effort to listen to the radio than to read a book! As might be anticipated, the radio is even more popular with the women than with the men, since they can listen to it during the day, while they do the housework. In the light of so much recent discussion on the reduction of hours of labor and the increase of leisure time, it was surprising to find that over 54 per cent of the people directly questioned said that their work left them no time for reading. A more care- ful check on this point showed that in addition to the few who spend several hours a day commuting to their work, and a few is Johnson, op. cit., p. 43.
COMMUNITY STUDIES IN READING 29 more whose work leaves them too tired to read, there are also a great many people whose working day is either not limited to any specific number of hours or else is unusually long. Among the women the majority in this group are the housewives, while among the men are found apartment-house superintendents, grocers, the owners of a bakery, shoe repairers, chauffeurs, do- mestic servants, salesmen, a hotel clerk, a hairdresser, a nurse, and members of similar professions.

Besides the radio and their work, no other interest conflicting or competing with reading was indicated by more than 6 per cent of the group, the proportion that mentioned attending the moving pictures. In fact, some of the people interviewed defi- nitely stated that since the depression they could not afford any form of amusement except the radio, at least during the winter months. Entertaining or visiting was reported by six people, card-playing and club work by five, and music by four. The "other interests" indicated included needlework, church work, traveling, and shopping. One retired business man added that he had read all of his life and that now he wanted to empty his mind of the thoughts of others for a little while and do some thinking himself!
30 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY CONCLUSIONS Summary.-In this study of the reading habits of a group of representative non-users of the Flushing Branch of the Queens Borough Public Library in Flushing, New York, the following facts have been brought out: I. Over 78 per cent of the registered voters in the election district in which the library is located were non-users of the li- brary on January I, I934. 2. Interviews were obtained for 225 of the 379 non-users of the library-a return of S9.3 per cent. 3. Approximately 6o per cent of the non-users interviewed as well as 6o per cent of the total number of non-users are men. 4. About 50 per cent of both the men and women interviewed are in their thirties or forties, and over 8o per cent are married, the percentage of married men being much greater than the per- centage of married women. 5. The largest occupational groups represented are the home- keepers and the other non-professional workers, which, to- gether, include nearly 8o per cent of all the people interviewed. 6. More than three-fourths of the group are native-born Americans. 7. Inquiries concerning the forms of material read by the non-users of the library revealed that about 95 per cent read newspapers, 6o per cent read magazines, and only 43 per cent read books. Moreover, although sex has no bearing on the num- ber of people who read newspapers, both magazines and books are read more frequently by women. 8. When asked to indicate the form of reading material pre- ferred, 8o per cent of all the people interviewed reported that they prefer both newspapers and magazines to books. 9. From the titles of the newspapers reported, it was found that nearly 65 per cent of the non-users of the library read one, or both, of the two local papers, although the men tend to favor the metropolitan newspapers. IO. The magazines most frequently read were the Saturday evening post, Cosmopolitan, Good houskeeping, Delineator, Liter- ary digest, Woman's home companion, and Ladies' home journal. i I. In addition to the 57 per cent who never read books,
COMMUNITY STUDIES IN READING 31 nearly 14 per cent read them only occasionally, so that, in real- ity, not more than 29 per cent of the entire group read books regularly. I 2. An analysis of the types of books preferred by fifty-three of the people who read books showed that fiction, biography, and books on business and technology were most popular among the men; while fiction, biography, and books on religion were most popular among the women. 13. Although only about one-fourth of the total number of people interviewed have ever used the Flushing Branch Library, 70 per cent of both the men and the women who read books are making indirect use of the library. 14. The present use of the library by these readers, who are technically non-users, includes primarily the reading of library books brought home by other members of the family and the use of family cards. On the other hand, these readers represent only one-third of the people who reported that there were library cards in the family. I5. Besides the indirect use of the Flushing Branch Library the sources of books most frequently mentioned by those who read books are purchase from bookstores and borrowing from rental libraries-the former being more popular with the men and the latter with the women. I6. Approximately one-half of the total number of the non- users interviewed reported that their principal reason for not using the library is lack of time and specified that the radio and their work are the chief interests that compete or conflict with reading. 17. Nearly one-fourth of the group stated that they do not use the library because they do not like to read, or, more specifi- cally, because they do not like to read books. i8. Other reasons given for non-use of the library are that books are obtained from other sources, that the library itself is inadequate, or that reading is impossible because of physical handicaps. Some implications for the library.-The 225 people about whom information has been obtained in this study is too small a sample upon which to base any final conclusions as to the fac-
32 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY tors responsible for non-use of the public library. Moreover, be- fore any definite conclusions can be reached, comparative studies of similar groups of both users and non-users of the li- brary must be made. From the data already obtained, how- ever, certain general implications for the library are apparent: i. That the number of registered card-holders is not an ade- quate indication of the actual number of people using the library is shown by the fact that one-fourth of the "non-users" inter- viewed reported that they are making indirect use of the library, primarily through other members of the family. 2. On the other hand, the presence of a library card in the family does not necessarily indicate that other members of the family are using the library, since only one-third of all those who, reported cards in the family are using them. 3. The fact that 6o per cent of the non-users of the library are men is significant, since it has already been demonstrated that "groups which differ in sex have marked differences in reading interest.",6 Moreover, from this study of the non-users of the library it has been discovered that the material read by the men and that read by the women differs also in form and type. 4. Inasmuch as the majority of the men interviewed are non- professional workers, and since the men who read books have expressed a preference for books on business and technology, it would seem that the traditional emphasis of the public library on belles-lettres might be modified to include more material on technical subjects. S. Because of the large proportion of the non-users of the li- brary who prefer newspapers and magazines to books, and be- cause of the small proportion who read books regularly, the public library must either find some way to stimulate a greater interest in books, preferably in co-operation with the other edu- cational institutions in the community, or else transfer its em- phasis from books to other forms of reading material. 6. Approximately three-fourths of the people interviewed said that they do not use the library because they have no time for reading, or else no interest in it. In all probability a lack of 16 Douglas Waples and R. W. Tyler, What people want to read about (Chicago: Uni- versity of Chicago Press, I93I), p. 124.
COMMUNITY STUDIES IN READING 33 interest is also implied in the reason "no time," since the radio was specified as the chief interest competing or conflicting with reading. With the increase of leisure the library no doubt will have to compete with many other interests as well. 7. From the conclusions indicated above it would seem that the public library must either continue to serve only the small minority of the adults in the community who already read books, or else make radical changes in its present program.
