A Survey and Evaluation of Minority Programs in Selected Graduate Library Schools HERMAN L. TOTTEN THE VIOLENT EVENTS of the 1960's focused the attention of the nation on the plight of minorities in this country. The American Library Association looked at the problem and noted that there were few minority representatives in either the profession or coming into it through the library schools. In an attempt to reverse this situation, A.L.A. decided to act positively and recruit Black students (then still called Negro), who were the only group identified as "minority" in 1966. The means of recruitment was through the appointment of an Ad Hoc Committee on Opportunities for Negro Students in the Library Profession. Its purpose was "to suggest what steps usefully could be taken by A.L.A. to identify promising young Negro undergraduates who might, once identified, be effectively counseled and aided toward the end of entering library school and securing positions in the library profession/1 * Additionally, the committee defined its objectives as: to explore the possibilities of securing financial assistance for such stu- dents to attend library schools, and to study the range of choice of Totten is Professor and Associate Dean, School of Library and Information Science, North Texas State University, Dentón, TX 76203. Editor's Note: Much of the information in this study is based upon library school publications issued in 1974-75. The survey data also are from that period. It is possible that the minority programs in some library schools have changed since that time. This study was funded by the Council on Library Resources. 18
A Survey and Evaluation of Minority Programs positions in the library profession available to Negroes and the ques- tion of equal opportunity in promotion. Preliminary to the development of its program of activities, a study was made to determine approximately how many Black graduates of accredited library schools there had been in the five years, 1962-1966. Questionnaires were sent to the deans of accredited library schools in the United States to obtain this information. It was assumed that library school records would not reveal the racial identity of graduates; but, that deans and/ or faculty mem- bers would be able to identify and estimate the number of Black graduates in the five-year period. Twenty-five library schools estimated the number of Black graduates, five responded that they could not supply this information, and three schools did not respond. Of the 9,204 graduates of 25 accredited library schools from 1962 through 1966, it was estimated that there were 372 or four per cent Blacks. When Atlanta University, the only predominantly Black institution concerned, was eliminated, there was a total of 9,002 library school graduates, with an estimated 190 or two per cent being Blacks. Even though the number of Black graduates of these 25 library schools was based upon estimates, this figure is indicative of the fact that a relatively small number of Blacks were entering the library profession.2 The library schools of America were charged with the responsibility of changing the racial and ethnic composition of their student bodies to be more representative and responsive to the populations which their graduates serve. A number of library schools instituted minority re- cruitment programs, most of them with assistance from the federal government. The Committee on Institutional Cooperation, a con- sortium of ten universities, instituted a doctoral program for minority or disadvantaged groups. Financial aid over a three-year period was provided for this program. The University of Illinois and the University of Maryland have had minority recruitment programs for several years. The University of Michigan offers minority programs at the master's and doctoral levels in librarianship. Florida State University, Indiana University, Emporia State University, Louisiana State University, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Queens College of the City University of New York, Rosary College, University of Texas at Austin, and Wayne State University are some of the other graduate library schools which have established minority recruitment programs. 19
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP The intent of this article is to survey the minority programs in selected graduate library schools in the United States to fill an informa- tion gap for those who would like to institute such programs but do not know how to go about it. Although there have been a number of minority programs in grad- uate library schools, information on these programs has been fugitive and sparse. More and more, graduate library schools will be embarking on their own programs to attract and train minority students, but because there exists no data bank of information to assist schools in setting up their own programs, library schools have been placed in the position of having to reinvent the wheel. The survey of minority programs that have already been tried and tested reveals much useful and insightful information for those schools that are about to develop minority programs. The survey developed a list of the complete range of minority programs given by selected graduate library schools, and raised questions about (1) how well the particular program met its stated goals; (2) the problems encountered in implementing the program; (3) sources of funding; (4) the re- sponsibility of the sponsors of the program; (5) the placement prob- lems involved; (6) the type of programs chosen; (dual track versus the school's regular program) and the successes and problems en- countered by each type. The library schools surveyed in this study were those given federal funds for 1973-74 under Title II-B of the Higher Education Act of 1965 as per notification of the U.S. Office of Education. The main interest of the researcher was programs on the master's level. Post- master's programs and doctoral programs were examined if they also happened to make provisions for minority students. Various techniques were used to determine the number and type of minority programs that have been developed by graduate library schools. These techniques included a survey of the literature, letters of inquiry, careful scrutiny of the catalogs and brochures of library schools describing such programs, preliminary discussions with deans and faculty at meetings of the Association of American Library Schools and the American Library Association, and the development of ques- tionnaires to survey and evaluate minority library school programs. On-site visitations were made to 12 schools. The remaining schools were surveyed through mailed questionnaires and contact with the deans at professional meetings. (Table 1.) At each of the library schools visited, the researcher met with the 20

A structured interview utilizing most of the questions on the student questionnaire took place in these en- counters. The major strength of these encounters was the individual contact and rapport established between the researcher and individual minority students. The major weakness was that answers given to the questions in groups could have been influenced by the response of others. Two questionnaires were used in the study: an institutional question- naire and a student questionnaire. The student form was mailed to all the minority students in the library schools surveyed. Notes from the structured interviews were used to supply responses for students who failed to return questionnaires. There were 282 usable student ques- tionnaires, which represented over 90 per cent of the minority students 21
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP enrolled in the library schools studied. The return of questionnaires was greater from the students whom the researcher met. No attempt was made to survey non-minority students, so comparisons between the two groups are impossible. Twenty-two schools were projected to be included in the study. The table below shows those schools which supplied institutional informa- tion via a questionnaire, which ones supplied information via on-site visits, and those institutions from which student questionnaires were returned. The results of the on-site visits and institutional questionnaire are considered below. In Table 2 are named the 19 schools for which in- formation was available with enrollment figures and the number of Title II-B fellowships, awarded under the Higher Education Act of 1965, available to minority students in 1974-75. In the past five academic school years the enrollment and availability of scholarship funds for White and Oriental-American students at Atlanta University have decreased. Illinois and Rutgers have experi- enced similar trends in the decreasing enrollment of minority students. At the same time, Maryland and Michigan have experienced increas- ingly large enrollments of minority students, especially Blacks. California at Berkeley, Illinois, and Michigan have special scholar- ship programs for minority students. California at Berkeley has a "Graduate Minority Program," Illinois has a "Scholarship Program in Library Science for Members of Minority Groups" which has provided financial aid for from 10 to 20 students since 1970. Minority students at Michigan's library school are eligible for university sponsored "Op- portunity Awards." The University of Michigan made a commitment in 1970 to devote a substantial portion of its student aid funds to assist minority, especially Black, students with a goal of achieving 10 per cent Black enrollment for the university as a whole by 1973-74. The library school was over that mark in 1973-74 and 1974-75. Columbia University's and the University of Illinois' library schools maintain special intern programs for minority students in the university libraries or assistantships to library school faculty. Maryland has a minority recruitment program which is managed by the "Ad Hoc Committee for Recruitment and Student Services" which set forth the goals, in May, 1969, of increasing the number of minority students in the college and providing students with information re- garding funds (grants, loans, and fellowships) . The objectives of the program in striving to meet the primary goals are the recruitment of 22

JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP these people into the college, retention in the college, and graduation from the college professionally prepared. The recruitment objectives are carried forth primarily in three ways: on-site visits to institutions with large or predominantly minority enrollments (about eight an- nually) ; the preparation of an audio-visual packet on the college and recruitment program to be made available to other institutions; and subscription to the Graduate Record Examination Minority Student Locator Service and the Library Personnel Resources Minority Referral Service. The committee makes recommendations to the Admissions Committee of the college. Queens College of City University of New York and the University of Texas at Austin have instituted special programs for the recipients of the Title II-B fellowships under the Higher Education Act of 1965. At Queens College, fellowship students must take two courses in materials for and services to minority groups and an internship in the New York City Community College in Brooklyn. These special classes are open to all library school students. At Texas, fellowship students must take a special seminar on service to minorities and the disadvan- taged, three courses outside the library school that contribute to the understanding of minorities, and a practicum in which the students actually work in a library serving minorities. At least four special programs for training minority librarians have been held. They are described below. In 1973-74, at Columbia University School of Library Service, 16 students (12 Blacks, 1 Puerto Rican, and 3 Whites) participated in the Community Media Librarian Program (COMLIP.) The curriculum of this program was tailored to meet individual students* needs in developing knowledge and skills in: identifying the sources of vital information needed by inner-city residents and establishing linkages with such sources; producing media for community needs; analyzing the role of media in communities with emphasis on cable television; helping inner-city residents use all media to communicate their in- formation needs and responses. The participants in the program took some special classes and some regular classes. Recruitment was via press releases to other schools, including undergraduate schools with large minority enrollments, the press, and the library press. The pro- gram was administered by a director and an advisory board with diversified membership, including faculty, students, practicing librar- ians, and community leaders. The characteristic of the COMLIP pro- gram which had the most important implication for the library school's 24
A Survey and Evaluation of Minority Programs curriculum was a basic philosophical framework of the public library as a component in the over-all service delivery system in inner-city communities. The program can be assessed as successful in that place- ment for those who desired library jobs was excellent and the program was continued in 1974-75 with ten participants. In 1973-74, Indiana University Graduate Library School awarded - $325,000 in Title II-B funds for a one-year institute for training li- brarians to specialize in Urban Area Community Colleges. The institute was multi-media, inter-disciplinary and individualized, culminating in a M.L.S. degree for the 18 minority participants; all the students had some special seminars and some regular courses; recruitment was via A.L.A., minority group newspapers, and person to person contacts. The program was significant because it was the first master's degree program specifically designed to prepare librarians for a community college setting and because it allowed 18 individuals of minority status, who might not otherwise have been able to do so, to advance them- selves individually and professionally. There is presently no special education program or funds for minority students at Indiana. In 1972, Queens College Department of Library Science received $27,000 from the U. S. Office of Education under Part E of the Educa- tion Professions Development Act for a one-year training program for minority librarians. The purpose of the program was to encourage and prepare outstanding, highly motivated minority students for effective leadership and support roles as librarians in academic libraries. Two minority-need oriented courses were required as was internship at New York City Community College Library. The funds for this program provided for five minority fellowships. Until 1974, the program was managed by a Black librarian on the staff of the department. Since his departure from the college, it has been managed jointly by the depart- ment's graduate advisor and assistant to the chairman. The program has been adjudged as successful in attracting and educating minority students. In reviewing this program, seven strengths were identified: the loca- tion of the program, the fact that it was an integral part of the regular program rather than adjunct to it, the program's flexibility, the two minority-need courses, the internship, the advisory committee and its membership, and the program's continuous system of monitoring and evaluating itself. Two weaknesses were noted: the lack of behavioral objectives and a milestone chart and the failure to attract participants from outside the New York City area. A follow-up evaluation of par- 25
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP ticipants and better and more means of on-going evaluation might be called for. In 1971-73 at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Library and Information Science, a special two-year institute for pro- fessional training of librarians for inner-city service was funded by the U. S. Office of Education under Title II-B of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The general goals of the institute were to provide entry into the library profession for students from educationally and finan- cially disadvantaged backgrounds, to equip those students with the skills and techniques commensurate to meet the informational, cultural, and educational needs of inner-city residents, to develop programs to serve the informational, cultural, and educational needs of the resi- dents of the Milwaukee inner-city communities, and to devise the edu- cational methods needed to prepare for the professional library spe- cialization of inner-city library service. The 15 participants (all from minority groups) were recruited via publicity materials sent to ap- propriate colleges and universities and by trips by the director and a member of the faculty to the Southwest and Southeast. The program was designed to articulate four major educational methods: formal academic studies, special group activities, field work, and individual guidance; all classes were specially developed to meet the goals of the institute. A survey of minority enrollment in accredited schools of library science in 1974-75 reveals that 64.5 per cent of those whose race was specified were Black and 11 per cent were Spanish- American.3 Com- parable findings of the survey being reported upon in this paper are given in Table 3 below.

TABLE 3 Fifty-two persons, or 18.4 per cent of 282, reported that they learned about the librarianship program at the school they were attending 26
A Survey and Evaluation of Minority Programs' through contact by' the library school. Of the enrolled Blacks, 20.7 per cent were contacted by the various library schools and 20.9 per cent of the enrolled Spanish-Americans indicated the same. All responses to the questions dealing with how students learned about the librarian- ship program at the school they were attending are tabulated in Table 4 below.

TABLE 4 This may not be an actual indication of the number and proportion of minority students contacted by library schools, since it does not include those contacted by one library school while attending another, which is an indication of the success of the minority recruitment pro- grams taken as a whole; however, neither does it give any indication of the number of potential minority students contacted but who failed to enroll in any library school surveyed. Of 282 persons responding, 208 or 73.8 per cent indicated that they chose a particular program because of the offer of financial aid, and 8.5 per cent reported that the reason was because of a special program for minorities. The two are not mutually exclusive. All 19 schools surveyed gave financial aid to 10 per cent or more of their minority students; 13 schools gave financial aid to 50 per cent or more, and seven schools, Rosary, Catholic, Illinois, Kentucky, Wisconsin at Mil- waukee, Indiana, and Texas, gave financial aid to all of their minority students. While the question asked why students chose a program, and it is possible that some students did not respond that the financial aid given them was responsible for their choice, this is unlikely. Indicating that they received financial aid were 76.9 per cent of the Blacks, 67.4 per cent of the Spanish- Americans, 75 per cent of the Native Amer- icans, 64.3 per cent of the Oriental-Americans, and 66.7 per cent of 27
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP all the others. Of students contacted and recruited by the library school they were attending, 92.3 per cent indicated they chose that school because of the offer of financial aid. (Table 5.)

TABLE 5 Students surveyed were asked to respond to a number of questions about their library school experience. Since there was no control group of nonminority students, the responses could have several varying significances. They might reflect the mixed feelings of library science students in general, without respect to minority status; they might in- dicate the mood at a specific institution (since some of the schools had a preponderance of positive or negative responses) again regardless of race; but they also might indicate the specific encounters that minority students have experienced in library school. Whatever the reasons for the answers, there were some definite trends and clusters of responses that speak to the atmosphere of a school and the value of the education that students perceive to have come out of a specific academic situation. The questions asked related to a student's initial impression of library school: whether he felt welcome or lost and alone; if he felt a part of the orientation activities; and his first encounter with his advisor. The methods by which students found out about the various pro- grams made no difference in how they felt when entering the various 28
A Survey and Evaluation of Minority Programs programs. There was a correlation between receiving an enthusiastic greeting from one's advisor and responding with similar enthusiasm, but it is unclear which is the cause and which the effect. The unpredict- able nature probably determines this as much as any factor, although it is important in setting the tone for a student's stay in graduate school. A high level of interest shown by the advisor in working out a student's library education program is also related to the warmth perceived in the initial interchange. Students were asked whether their programs and schedules seemed to be different from those of non-minority students and whether the curriculum seemed too hard or about right. In some of the programs, the courses would be different because of the nature of the specific program in which the student was enrolled, that is, those schools with dual tracks. Others might have felt that they were different even though their class schedules were not intended to be any different from those of non-minority students. There was no differentiation between these two circumstances. Also, minority students might have chosen a specialty that would be out of the mainstream whatever the racial makeup of the student. The difference in program, however, correlated with a feeling that the curriculum was about right, and a program that was essentially the same with a feeling that course work was too hard. Feeling welcome and among friends upon entering library school correlated with feeling involved in orientation, with an enthusiastic advisor who is interested in one's program, with having one's work being shown more consideration than others, with being invited to discuss one's work and other matters with faculty and students, with rating one's over-all library experience as good to excellent. It is im- possible to say which is the cause and which the effect in any of these correlations; however, it is more likely that each fortifies the other and is part of the cause and part of the effect in each of the correla- tions. The responses to questions dealing with minority students' experi- ences in library school are enumerated in Table 6 below. Two hundred seventy-two persons gave 357 responses to this question. Of all those responding, 55, or 20.2 per cent, gave a negative response. The actual number may be quite a bit smaller, as a single person may have given more than one negative response. All of this is speculation, however, and the best solution is merely to disregard all evidence relating to these questions and factors. Comments were solicited from the students at the end of the ques- 29

Many were of a general negative or positive nature. A representative selection appears below: "I personally feel that so far my experience has been quite rewarding. I have not experienced any of the prejudice that I had anticipated. To this date, I do not regret having applied to this school; as a matter of fact, I am quite happy." "This library school is basically a prejudiced institution where instructors tend to treat Black students as inferior. It seems that they tend to question our being here as students." "My total experience has been very pleasant and intellectually stimulating. My program has been tailored to my interests and I have experienced no overt acts of prejudice." "The feeling was that this small minority would be tolerated but not much more." Other comments dealt with curricular complaints which could be representative of minority and non-minority students alike, the lan- guage problem of a Puerto Rican student, the lack of a local Black community at one library school. Most of the comments, however, dealt with either positive or negative experiences students had with advisor, faculty members, and other members of the library school staff. A representative selection appears below: "When I first started in the program there were a few subtle incidents where 30
A Survey and Evaluation of Minority Programs I was obviously slighted by one particular member of the faculty. After this person became acquainted with me as a person, rather than a minority; his attitude changed considerably. Over-all, I was treated fairly throughout my library school experience." "I have been treated fairly by students and faculty except in one instance. I was in a special seminar for Library Services to the Disadvantaged in which I was made aware of some prejudices on the part of the professor, not directly toward me, but toward my people. I was disturbed that my fellow students might be influenced by the professor's prejudicial statements." "Please note that my experience might have been worse except for one woman who worked in the Admissions Office. She was extremely helpful in every way possible. If she couldn't answer a question then she would pursue the answer from other sources. Without her aid, advice, friendship, etc., I might have been tempted to drop out." "The only complaint that I really have is with my advisor. I felt that he was too inexperienced to deal with my problems; in addition there seemed to have been a lot of politicking and jealousies among individual faculty members. Some students, like myself, were caught in the middle. My present advisor is excellent in dealing with problems and he offers to help in all areas of the library environment." "I do, however, feel that there is much lacking in the program. I did feel strange in the predominantly white surrounding and felt that there was little warmth and openness among the faculty. They were cold, and aloof and often poor teachers. Of course, I also had about two who were quite good and people-like." "Although I feel that on the whole I have been treated fairly, I do notice that as long as I do more than is required as far as class assignments are con- cerned, I will get an A. If I do only what is required, the grade will un- doubtedly be a B-f- or a B. Whereas the white students, not all - but many, will do the required work and get an A or A-. In other words, the discrep- ancy between my A of more-than-required work, and their (whites) A-, of required work, is much too wide. In order to get an A out of a course, I know I must do much more than the required amount of work. I certainly expect this in graduate school but all students should have to perform equally well in order to receive an A, instead of some working extra hard to get an A, and the others doing only what is required and receiving an A-." An examination of the comments in relation to the responses to 31
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP the other questions shows that those students who had a negative ex- perience with their advisor or a member of the faculty generally rated their library experience as negative. Those that had a particularly good experience rated their over-all library experience as positive. This survey has shown that those library schools which did not insti- tute separate programs for minority students were notably more suc- cessful than those which did. However, the factors of feeling positive about library school correlate with having a somewhat different pro- gram from other students with similar interests. It would, therefore, seem that the most successful program would have one or two classes relevant to the special interests and needs of minority students as elec- tives, together with the regular classes of the curriculum. Other factors are also important in insuring the success of minority student programs. One is the ability to offer financial assistance to minority students either in the form of grant/fellowships or assistant- ships. A second factor is the commitment of the dean and administra- tion, faculty, and students of the library school to the minority student program. The results of the student survey show the attitude of the minority students' advisors to be especially important in affecting their attitude toward the library school. Minority students have recorded their library school as unpleasant when there has been a single preju- diced faculty member. Thus, the commitment of all members of the faculty is essential. The above findings reveal three essentials to any successful minority student program: (1) the availability of financial assistance, (2) the inclusion of minority students in the regular program of the library school, and (3) the commitment of the administrator, students, and faculty to the program.
