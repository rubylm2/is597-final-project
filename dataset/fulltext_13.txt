IV A Feminist Standpoint for Library and Information Science Education Jane Anne Hannigan This paper was presented as the Keynote Address at ALISE, February 3, 1994. The basic premises upon which librari- anship and information science have been built are structured on white, mid- dle-class male paradigms that have sys- tematically, if unconsciously, silenced and excluded women.1 We must work just as systematically to hear the voices of all those who have been silenced not just because it is right and just to do so, but because it is inaccurate scholarship not to do so.2 My task is to use a feminist standpoint to begin to correct that inac- curacy in curricula, pedagogy, and re- search in library and information sci- ence. It is difficult to separate these three aspects of our work because they are, in my view, totally connected. I have, however, for the purposes of this paper, attempted to deal with them in- dependently, although, from time to time, my instinct to web ideas and infor- mation together overtakes me. I am not suggesting that we ignore or eliminate more than one hundred years of accom- plishments in our field, but rather that we re-examine our history and the basic premises, both of that history and of current theory and practice to include ideas, people, and practices that have been excluded. It is essential to begin any revision with a study of the episte- mologies of feminism.3 As a profession we have demonstrated concern for the advancement of women and for pay eq- uity; now is the time to explore the theoretical structures of feminist phi- losophy and thought.4 Curricula New, pluralistic curricula in library and information science education that are intellectually valid and restructured to include multiple perspectives of race, gender, culture, class, religion, sexual orientation, and national origin may well, in their diversity and connected- ness to a variety of human experiences, offer a positive and exciting future to our profession. The design and imple- mentation of such inclusive curricula is already taking place in many disci- plines and is desperately needed in our own. The effort to develop inclusive curricula in a profession that primarily consists of females must begin with gen- der. Let me make clear that I am using the word gender not in a biological sense, but rather, in an experiential way, that is, as a social construction. It is simplistic to suggest that we revise the curriculum to include a few citations to books or articles by and about women; I Fall 1994 297

I want us to study women's ways of knowing and the riches avail- able in feminist scholarship that will enlighten our curricula, our teaching, and our research. Peggy Mclntosh offers a framework that many faculties in a variety of disci- plines have used in the analysis and re-writing of curricula.5 She identified five phases of curriculum revision: "(1) Womanless History, (2) Women in His- tory, (3) Women as a Problem, Anomaly, or Absence in History, (4) Women As History, and (5) History Redefined or Reconstructed to Include Us All."6 It should be obvious that we have treated our predominately female pro- fession as if all major theory and re- search has been contributed by men, thus, we created a womanless history.7 Suzanne Hildenbrand writes: "Library history has been, therefore, largely a history o/men, often directors of large libraries, by men. Areas in which almost no men participated, notably children's work, were (and continue to be) almost totally without history."8 In Sydney Pierce's "Dead Germans* and the The- ory of Librarianship," the author sug- gests a reconstruction of our intellectual and theoretical literature. Sadly she herself does not represent women's con- cerns.9 Typical are the responses of five male library educators who name only male librarians to qualify as "dead Ger- mans."10 An important point made by Marilyn Schuster and Susan Van Dyne is that "it seems intellectually irrespon- sible to allow an increasingly tenured faculty whose primary research will never be on women to continue teach- ing for the foreseeable future as though scholarship on women and an inform- ing female perspective did not exist."11 This seems particularly relevant to li- brarianship. The radical transformation of a cur- riculum really involves a transforma- tion of the conception of self at an intel- lectual level as well as at its deepest unconscious level. Thus, women fac- ulty must recognize that conflict is an inevitable part of the process of change, and that conflict should be openly ac- knowledged and used to move the change process forward. The problem for us is one of recognizing the ways women have been absented and deval- ued in librarianship. For example, school librarianship has a rich history of innovative and creative women; yet they, and their contributions, are almost never discussed in either text or class- room. It is easier to marginalize or wipe them from library history. There may be resistance before we are able to reclaim and rewrite women's positive contribu- tions in a way that not only acknow- ledges, but celebrates a diversity of val- ues previously absent from the traditional paradigm of our field. We must ask ourselves whether the histori- cal exclusion of women in librarianship and information science has limited the questions asked in our discipline. The movement from phase 1 to phase 2 of Mclntosh's framework is a necessary step, but one that is deceptive in its image of inclusiveness. Implicit in it is the concept of a few exceptional women making it on male standards; Volume 35, Number 4
A Feminist Standpoint 299 thus, it denies the centrality of women to our history. To simply add the names of Margreet Wijnstroom, Adelaide Haase, or Clara Stanton Jones without adequately exploring the overall contri- butions of other women who were their contemporaries does not accomplish what is necessary. In Mclntosh's third phase, women are treated as a problem. This generates a response of anger to the established canon and to the absence of women in the structuring of our professional knowledge. Often this anger originates with the startling realization of the poli- tics and assumptions that have caused women's absence.12 In an earlier paper, I examined the absence of women theo- rists in several management texts used in our discipline. I note with continued and increased anger that the 1993 edi- tion of Stueart and Moran, clearly one of the most frequently used texts in management courses, in addressing what the future may hold in manage- ment trends, repeats the identical sen- tence found in the previous edition, and I quote, "Finally, but most important, the issue of women and minorities as managers is receiving due considera- tion."13 In examining both the text and the bibliographies in this book, one finds that there are no feminist theorists identified for the reader. Clearly, this issue is not yet "receiving due consid- eration." Androcentric attitudes impede women's advancement and deprive the profession of full human potential in many ways. In recent discussions on Internet, students reported the occur- rence of gender bias in career counsel- ing by library school faculty, which I consider an extension of curricula. Un- fortunately, such androcentric views are held not only by our male col- leagues; even those of us who consider ourselves feminist sometimes succumb by assuming that our male students will more likely be hired in certain types of positions and, therefore, recommend them rather than equally qualified women. It will take time to raise faculty consciousness and to counsel individu- als in relation to their responsibility to students and to the profession. In my mind, it is a moral imperative for deans to take a leadership role in this matter. Androcentric attitudes impede women's advance- ment and deprive the profession of full human potential in many ways. It is also very distressing that much theory and research in the field seems oblivious to feminist scholarship. It is, after all, library literature that our stu- dents read, analyze, and evaluate as part of their educational experience. An ex- amination of fourteen major journals in our profession indicates a poor repre- sentation of feminist scholarship (see appendix). Although this table does not include all the major journals, it is a representative snapshot and includes those journals available in a major uni- versity library and through the assis- tance of colleagues. The data displayed in the appendix are drawn from On Ac- count of Sex and my analysis of the 1993 selected literature. In all cases a broad, rather than narrow, definition of feminist/women's studies was used for counting articles and signed columns. Only 3.01 percent of all the articles pub- lished in these journals in 1993 had any feminist content. It is an embarrassment that a profes- sion such as ours, which is predomi- nately female, has such inadequate rep- resentation of feminist concerns. Until we produce a sizable body of feminist literature, we must draw upon feminist Fall 1994
300 Journal of Education for Library and Information Science thinking and writing in other disci- plines in order to inform our own. It may be probable that most women in library and information science are not writing from a feminist standpoint, but we must also question whether, when they do write, they are being published. I believe that the library press appears to have a negative bias that is demon- strated by the way they consistently ig- nore feminist scholarship. In general, the press does not seem to commission articles from a feminist perspective, nor does it appear to look kindly on such submissions. But an editor can make a difference. Wilson Library Bulletin has published five feminist articles this year under new editor, Grace Anne de Can- dido. Editors like School Library Journal's Lillian Gerhardt, and Gloriana St. Clair of College and Research Libraries are also in the forefront of accepting such material. The Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science devoted an entire issue in 1992 to women's studies. There has been a raised consciousness regarding feminist problems in cataloging and subject indexing, but the problems still exist. Although I have not conducted a formal study of monograph publishing in our field, a casual observation reveals little being published. In a discussion with Phyllis Weisbard, Women's Stud- ies Librarian at Wisconsin, she noted that fewer feminist books are even re- viewed in the library press than might be expected. One is enormously grateful then for such publications as New Books on Women & Feminism, Feminist Col- lections: A Quarterly of Women's Stud- ies Resources, Women Library Workers Journal, Belles Lettres, and The Wo- men's Review of Books.1* There has been a raised conscious- ness regarding feminist problems in cataloging and subject indexing, but the problems still exist. Kristin Gerhard, Trudi Jacobson, and Susan Williamson report in their study of indexing ade- quacy, using the case of "Women's Stud- ies," that over 60 percent of the journals were inadequately indexed.15 In Janu- ary 1994, Library Literature does not have any subject headings for "femi- nist" or "feminism." After several tele- phone conversations in December and January, however, editor Cathy Rent- schler has agreed to add "feminist" and "feminism" to the indexing terms as of March 1994. She has also agreed to add appropriate sub-terms as needed.16 Let us now go back to Mclntosh and her conceptualization of a fourth phase of curriculum development that values the assigned work of women in every culture. Thus, winning and losing, char- acteristic of earlier phases of curricu- lum development when women are seen as excellent only in comparison to men, is not as important as the decent survival of all. This is where we are aiming right now, wishing to value women's work in librarianship - valu- ing what women do. And asking, "What is the special contribution that women have made to the profession of librari- anship?" What, for instance, can we learn from observing the practice of fe- male school library media specialists, academic librarians, or corporate li- brarians? This phase also acknowledges women who, because of home and fam- ily responsibilities, cannot afford to get on the "fast track" to leadership and values the work of women that has been invisible, behind the scenes, supportive of others rather than striving to reach the top. Once this phase has been reached, the curriculum becomes more "speculative and experimental in its Volume 35, Number 4
A Feminist Standpoint 30 1 epistemology," for there have to be "new categories of experience, new ways of doing research, and new ways of teaching."17 Boundaries break down between disciplines, between teacher and subject, and between teacher and student. In the fifth stage of curricular trans- formation, Mclntosh sees knowledge re- defined and reconstructed, as inclusive rather than exclusive. "A Phase Five curriculum would help us to produce students who can see patterns of life in terms of systems of race, culture, caste, class, gender, religion, national origin, geographical location and other influ- ences on life which we haven't begun to name."18 Women share the educational backgrounds that are primarily those of the androcentric white society. Many women who work in libraries do not fully realize how much of their former education has ignored the major portion of our world population. That bias en- compasses not only women, but persons of color. Schuster and Van Dyne also are insistent that race and class be in- cluded, with gender as a category of analysis.19 This is particularly impor- tant in light of future growth in what are now minorities in the U.S. population, and the subsequent need to recruit and retain both men and women from these populations to work as professionals in librarianship and information science. We teach from a set of predetermined assumptions about people and about cul- tures that impedes the success of our edu- cation of professionals. If we do not ap- proach our curricula responsibilities with a mind-set that is inclusive rather than exclusive, we are doomed to failure. Curricula Solutions It is not my responsibility to rewrite curricula for librarianship and informa- tion science, but I have provided a lens to examine the status quo. I will now suggest specific things that might be done in revisioning curricula. Special topics courses in feminist theory/schol- arship and methodology, taught with an interdisciplinary focus at both the mas- ter's and Ph.D. levels, should be seri- ously considered and developed based on a sound grounding in feminist theory and scholarship.20 Many such attempts place women in a problem status, but they are a move in the right direction. Alternative approaches might include, for example, a management course in- corporating feminist theory and schol- arship that could be the initial impetus to transform management courses as well as other courses in the curriculum. We teach from a set of predetermined assumptions about people and about cultures that impedes the success of our education of professionals. The work of Kathy Ferguson is critical to providing a feminist perspective on the bureaucracy of management,21 as is the work of Kathleen Iannello. Iannello presents a study of modified consensus as a construct in organizational inter- ventions that might be used in libraries. The Australian study by Clare Burton opens the wide range of concerns faced by women in the workplace when fed- eral legislation, in this case the Federal Equal Economic Opportunity Laws of Australia, is operationalized.22 Burton discusses the nature of organizational bias and human resources management, commenting that often society places lesser value on women's work and thus, wage equity is challenged. Fall 1994
302 Journal of Education for Library and Information Science Additionally, in either Manage- ment, Library Issues, and/or Ethics courses, a unit on sexual harassment must be included. We must be aware that age and recent societal events are factors in the way we respond to such harassment. The code of silence that many of us accepted and even taught is intolerable to today's young women. For example, one might study and use the two-part article on "Sexual Harass- ment" by Sarah Watstein in Wilson Li- brary Bulletin to provide students with the opportunity to address this subject and resolve situations that are realistic and job-oriented.23 The documents to which Watstein refers are excellent choices, and, with the addition of sev- eral newer works on sexual harassment, might enlarge the context for thinking and discussion of both teachers and stu- dents. Adding such a unit presupposes an understanding of principles, the law, and values in issues of sexual harass- ment. It would be mutually beneficial to include professionals from the practic- ing community in such a unit to interact with students on this issue. This might be done in a face-to-face colloquium or through telecommunications or simple Internet exchanges using a mentoring system. Feminist scholarship involves looking at the assumptions and biases, particularly androcentric biases, incor- porated in theory and research that di- rectly affect the ways libraries collect, store, and disseminate materials and the choice of services offered to users. Thus, feminist scholarship can, by pro- viding alternative perspectives, make a difference in the teaching of courses such as collection development and user services. One example of how the- ory and research affect collection devel- opment and library and information services regards aging.24 There is much critical commentary on the fact that, to date, the older woman has been seen only in relation to research on aging in men. To what extent do faculty raise issues of completeness and balance in such findings with their students? Al- ternative, more inclusive, approaches would involve seeing what is absent from such information or simply not seen because of the single lens perspec- tives that are taken. How might alterna- tive views of aging from a woman's per- spective alter or add to our understanding of library practice? To what extent does this alter curricula content in reference, collection devel- opment, and popular culture? Feminist scholarship involves looking at the assumptions and biases, particularly androcentric biases, incorporated in theory and research that directly affect the ways libraries collect store, and disseminate materials and the choice of services offered to users. New work on a women's biography has been addressed in the collection edited by Sara Alpern and her co- authors.25 This work provides insight- ful comments on the differences of ap- proach to a biography once one is consciously involved in feminist con- structs. Discussion of the points made by the individual biographers in a refer- ence class and/or a literature class might alter the ways in which we teach selection of materials and readers' advi- sory services. Similar insights might re- sult from a discussion of Janice Rad- way's work on women's reading.26 Information can also be hidden be- Volume 35, Number 4
A Feminist Standpoint 303 cause of gender biases in indexing and cataloging practices that make that in- formation difficult to retrieve. For ex- ample, we have taken for granted the hierarchical structures of classification by Dewey and others that have been imposed on our field as the only viable approaches. In actuality, we might spend time in classes and in research considering alternative non-hierarchi- cal structures, particularly since com- puters have offered us new capabilities that permit many more quantum leaps than were feasible just a few years ago. We are still teaching Dewey and LC and think we are on top of things by adding OCLC and RLIN records' control to cata- loging courses. Increasingly, parapro- fessionals are responsible for most as- pects of cataloging; thus, it might be advantageous to explore new directions in subject analysis, retrieval structures, and user-dominant constructs. We are still teaching a book location paradigm in technical services courses with some consideration of a bibliographic record model, but with little or no considera- tion of the cognitive functions in classi- fication. Certainly, this latter approach would make for sound discussions of the mapping of knowledge and the con- cepts of hierarchical versus relational strategies.27 Thesauri might form a natural means to initiate such discus- sion. A Women's Thesaurus by Mary Ellen Capek, for example, has less em- phasis on the syntactic structures and more on semiotic relationships.28 "Webbing" is a feminist concept that forces one to see numerous rela- tionships and leaves an open-ended- ness to a mapping process. Cognitive concepts such as these appear to have a connection with the virtual library or virtual world of information. The kinds of structures observed in these newer interactive technological systems bear a greater resemblance to a feminist model than to an androcentric one. This might, if one were to study it creatively, have a direct bearing on the selection of con- tent of courses in classification and cataloging, as well as indexing and as- pects of information science. Sara Ruddick's concept of maternal thinking as a thinking that arises from a practice could provide a framework for the special kind of work that children's librarians do.29 Although maternal thinking basically refers to the valuing of women's thought as it develops within the context of raising and nurtur- ing children, Ruddick disassociates it entirely from biological motherhood. It is an ethical mode of thinking that both men and women may develop as they nurture others. Children's librarians practice a special kind of nurturance that fosters the intellectual, emotional, and social growth of young people in a caring and sharing environment. Through the fostering, nurturing, and connectedness in the practice of chil- dren's librarianship, young people and materials are brought together in a way that brings joy to experiences with in- formational and aesthetic content and subsequently encourages a life-long love of literature and learning. Ruddick's work, along with that of Carol Gilligan and others, is particu- larly important in the education of chil- dren's librarians and school library media specialists.30 Gilligan's under- standing of gender differences, as re- vealed in her modifications of Kohlberg's work on moral development, has become part of the mainstream study of child and adolescent develop- ment theories. Unfortunately, however, this theory and the ethics of care it rep- resents is often just studied without any real effort to translate it into practice. Children's and young adult litera- ture courses, also included in the gradu- ate education of those intending to work with young people, frequently do not make serious attempts to include the Fall 1994
304 Journal of Education for Library and Information Science voices of young people of all races, cul- tures, and classes in the accepted can- ons of these literatures. Kay Vandergrift sets forth a feminist research agenda for youth literature that impacts upon cur- ricula in these courses. For example, not only does she suggest a re-examina- tion of the literary canon, but also stud- ies of narrative structures and feminist approaches to reader-response theory and criticism.31 Incorporating these ideas into such courses alters signifi- cantly the way we think about young people and the library services and ma- terials provided for them. A real acceptance of feminist scholarship cries out for the inclusion and integration of ethical and moral values in all aspects of library and information science curricula. A real acceptance of feminist schol- arship cries out for the inclusion and integration of ethical and moral values in all aspects of library and information science curricula. An important aspect of being a professional is the process of making decisions. Feminist thought calls on us to recognize the often un- stated moral and ethical values that in- fluence that decision making. Curricula need to provide opportunities for stu- dents to explore their professional val- ues in relation to such issues as censor- ship, fee-based services, equity of access, and personnel management. The ethical and moral premise of restructured curricula also must be in- corporated into the patterns of class- room relationships between and among faculty and students. We must learn to build upon a user-centered (here stu- dent-centered) approach and the phi- losophy of care in the classroom, so that our students will be able to transfer these values to the workplace after graduation. The participatory, collabo- rative approach to teaching and learn- ing grounded in the context of diverse human experience must take its rightful and valued place in the educational en- terprise. Curricula planning should also consider issues of gender in relation to the technologies employed by library and information science professionals. Evidence indicates that men and women have different feelings about and expectations of the use of technol- ogy.32 Thus, we cannot assume that technology is neutral. Accepting that gender differences might exist for our students implies curricula alteration to meet differing needs. In addition, de- signing courses that are either totally theoretical or totally practical is to ig- nore student needs. If students are to grasp the concepts of human informa- tion behavior, they must be placed in the context for such behaviors. From even this brief discussion, it should be obvious that adding a few readings about women in librarianship does not constitute curricula revision- ing. The token approach has never worked. The kind of intense research and study needed to offer a wide range of alternatives is a heady process. I have spent many years reading, listening to lectures, sharing ideas with women on- line, studying syllabi,33 and I have joined in small discussion groups, all in an attempt to explore what it means to learn as a woman. Pedagogy Research indicates that there are differ- ences between the way women learn and the way men learn.34 To ignore that Volume 35, Number 4
A Feminist Standpoint 305 women differ in their experiences, their backgrounds, and their attitudes is to ignore reality. Research tells us that women seek connections and tend to value situational opportunities. Many, but not all, women prefer the relational or webbing approach rather than the linear approach to dealing with infor- mation and ideas. One notes with inter- est the current vision of those who are designing virtual realities and interac- tive media environments; they assume a relational rather than a linear model. The Human Genome Project has recog- nized the need to move beyond the pure genetic sciences to examine law and ethics as natural and integral portions of the project.35 Such reaching out to con- nect a variety of ideas across disciplines and concerns is characteristically fe- male. Women scientists have had a pro- found influence on the way research and project design in the sciences is now done. Faculty often approach interaction with students in a listening for mode rather than a listening to mode.36 Too often we consider logical, linear means of organizing information and ideas as the only appropriate way and, therefore, listen for a specific logical answer that fits our pattern of expectations. Femi- nist thought, on the other hand, ac- knowledges alternative forms of rela- tional thinking and networked ideas and allows students to place their own ideas anywhere within that network. It is in listening to those ideas that teach- ers can expand their own thinking and see new relationships and, therefore, help students make connections among content, and between content and their own lives. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator has a long-established validity and is widely used in this country. With a di- rect relationship to Jungian psychology, it offers an opportunity to examine how people garner information and how they make decisions.37 With the results of such a test, it might be possible to design teaching models that will match the needs of our students. Too often faculty employ a pedagogical approach chosen in isolation from the students we teach. To continue to ignore the unique voices of women as well as men in our classes is more than a stupidity; it is detrimental to the profession. Often students are not pleased in classes be- cause faculty members structure every- thing to match their own learn- ing/teaching styles. One of the most difficult aspects of teaching is the matching of teaching strategies to the learning styles of students. In the aware- Feminist thought acknowl- edges alternative forms of relational thinking and networked ideas and allows students to place their own ideas anywhere within that network. ness of diversity within a class and in accepting responsibility for responding to that diversity, faculty members fulfill their responsibility as teachers. It might come as a shock to some faculty to learn that they may not always be right in their views and in the accuracy of what they teach. Furthermore, what they teach may or may not be accepted by students. To move to a cooperative learning process is to move to the accep- tance of alternative views in an environ- ment that encourages questioning and is accepting of alternative approaches and answers as valid responses. Another basic area of curricula within library education that cries out Fall 1994
30ó Journal of Education for Library and Information Science for a more humanistic, inclusive, user- centered teaching approach is that of reference services. Too often reference service is perceived almost exclusively in terms of the tools that contain the information thought to be important to our society rather than in terms of the library patron and the context in which the reference encounter occurs. David Can says, "In practice, information problems are likely to be solved from the center outward - where the center is the user."38 Reference students need to be more concerned with the process of inquiry and discovery than with the endless competition to learn the most tools. In reference class, for example, we might form several small study groups, provide each with a profile of a large public library and/or academic library and of a client seeking information on a topic such as "Williams Syndrome" (substitute a different disease for each cluster). Have each group discuss the nature of the client, what might be known about the client, how to deter- mine what it is that the client is seeking, how to employ an ethics of care, and how to maintain the accuracy and re- cency of data presented to the client. It is in the discovery process that we learn the most. In point of fact, what we dis- cover in the aforementioned example, is that information valued as most helpful to the client is not in a tool, but rather in an informal network of parents with Williams Syndrome children. The concept of working in groups both inside and outside class meeting times provides essential opportunities to discuss and share approaches to an issue, problem, or concern. Flexibility of both faculty members and students is critical to this learning style. I have spo- ken with several faculty who use the cooperative approach and small and large teams for assignments; and each reports success, although they also note the frequency of student complaints about meeting time constraints and po- tential grading inequities. Most disci- plines that have used this approach re- port similar findings but indicate overall success in their research reports. Spacial arrangement of the learning environment can, I believe, make a dif- ference in student attitude and re- sponses.39 An understanding of how we organize space, who uses this space, and for what purposes is critical to the learning process. Aspects of both the symbolic and multicultural value sys- tem are implicit but are often made ex- plicit in spacial configurations. As we look at data on technological bias by gender, spacial constructs play a part. How do libraries and library schools configure computer spaces? Do these spaces inhibit use by women? Might we foster equality through environments that are radically different? Women scholars have noted that shared discus- sion of issues and shared problem solv- ing is a needed aspect of our teaching. Modified consensus occurs more easily when people are facing one another rather than in isolated or adversarial postures. Treichler and Kramarae's re- search suggests that the interaction of men and women differ in classroom set- tings, and that overall it is the interac- tion of men in the academy that is val- orized. The university, argue the authors, "is typically more compatible with and rewarding of men's interaction patterns."40 In addition to spacial con- figurations, the way we prepare syllabi, the way we design assignments, the na- ture of our feedback all contribute to what students feel about their educa- tion, and all require the intense study of faculty to provide the best quality. Our nurturing of students and the caring for those with whom they will work in libraries may sometimes lead us to dangerous educational practices. His- torically, as well as today, we legitimize Volume 35, Number 4
A Feminist Standpoint 307 content in the curriculum that should, in fact, be developed as practicums or other alternatives, available to or re- quired of students. For instance, creat- ing courses to teach the navigation of the Internet, DIALOG, or any other da- tabase is a modern technological ver- sion of the old courses in library hand or the use of audiovisual equipment. We need to make this available to students but should not accept it within our al- ready limited credit structure any more than we would accept credit for a typing course or the production of overhead transparencies. There are several listservs devoted to the concerns of women.41 I have noted that women in all disciplines have increasingly found their voices and are speaking out. The use of the Internet, and the future of our involve- ment with it, is a strong pedagogical issue. I have spent the last several years monitoring various listservs and shar- ing ideas and information with col- leagues not only in librarianship, but in other disciplines as well.42 I have seen flame wars, harassment, caring, and sound informational exchange from all over the world. Yes, I have witnessed males using listservs to silence women and in many cases, unfortunately, they succeed. I have seen professionals pro- vide information that was sloppy and even inaccurate. Obviously, we have a great deal to learn from the net, and we need to incorporate it in our teaching designs. Consider for a moment how many of you are active Internet users. I will admit my disappointment in noting that much of the conversation on list- servs is not that of library and informa- tion science faculty. One of the most difficult problems with the Internet is that of time. To determine the extent of involvement and the nature of that in- volvement is a concern. Assigning stu- dents the task of monitoring a listserv without providing an opportunity to discuss what they observe is an incom- plete exercise. But, how does one dis- cuss if you have not had some shared experiences? Research Essential to changes in curricula and pedagogy is a solid base in research. It is essential for researchers to acknow- ledge the authenticity of women's sub- jective experience and knowledge - both our own as researchers and that of the women we might study. This is a radical notion to those of us trained in androcentric objectivity in research. Feminist theory and research offers a sound approach that we might employ in our own discipline. The tendency in research in librarianship and informa- tion science is to examine any problem from the perspective of the professional rather than addressing our research from the perspective of the user. Earlier patterns in user studies do not really shift this perspective because, for the most part, user responses were over- shadowed by concepts of control through closed-ended questionnaires and surveys. I am suggesting that we make greater use of ethnographic re- search approaches that have proved successful in other disciplines. For in- stance, if we want to understand what value users place on libraries, it might be useful to sit down and talk at length with a series of users and non-users and then analyze the content of these dis- cussions. It is not in this plan to have a pre- determined view, but rather to listen to what participants say. I believe that we may arrive at some surprising findings using such research strategies. We as- sume a number of things about the ways our audiences use collections, but we do not really know a patron's degree of satisfaction in the individual use of Fall 1994
308 Journal of Education for Library and Information Science materials. Our research has been domi- nated by quantitative studies organized in a logical fashion. We must begin to consider such aspects as response based on gender, race, class, and ethnicity, which are rarely studied.43 It is not in- dicating a biological sex or cultural heritage as a variable that is critical; rather it is dialoguing from the stand- point of persons in these categories. Too often we concentrate on col- lecting data to prove what we have al- ready determined rather than collecting data and then analyzing that data with a more open mind to see what that data tells us. Furthermore, some of the most important information to be gained from respondents may not even fit into the data sets we have predetermined. I would draw an analogy here to so-called scientific experiment books for young people, many of which are the antithe- sis of experimentation. Some of these books attempt to convince young read- ers that, if they have not exactly repli- cated the results of an experiment, they are in error and should repeat the ex- periment until they get it right, rather than analyzing the results they did get. One area of research that needs to be examined is that of gender bias in school library media centers. There is a wealth of research from the American Association of University Women (AAUW) and others who report various forms of gender bias in schooling.44 Nonetheless, there has been little, if any, research to study gender bias in the library media center. Gender bias may occur in collection development, in our interactions with students, and in the computer configurations and use that we formulate. In preliminary research on gender bias, Vandergrift identified a variable that alters the way we might approach such research; namely, many practitioner researchers did not recog- nize gender bias in their own behavior. In fact, most were taken aback by the sudden recognition that they were in- deed gender-biased. In the evaluation of research for grants, for projects, for tenure and pro- motion decisions, we need to allow for and, above all, we need to value a wide range of alternative research designs. Because you have been trained as a re- searcher, do not assume that all good research must imitate your approach or be classed as less than acceptable. This profession, like others, is not immune to arrogance and attitudes that diminish and devalue certain kinds of research and writing. This obviously cannot con- tinue if library education is to be vital in the twenty-first century. Sarah Pritchard raises a number of questions we might consider as research foci in examining technology from a feminist perspective. Do information technologies benefit the educational and economic status, and the civic participation of, women across society? Do women of diverse back- grounds and opinions have equitable ac- cess and opportunity to define and shape the directions and uses of infor- mation technology? Is the nature of the information itself transformed and broadened?45 Research must be undertaken to ex- plore the nature of cognitive structures in all types of catalogs and databases. If we continue to assume that Z39.50 will solve all our future interactive prob- lems, we will suffer for that decision. The very nature of interactivity will al- ter the way we form informational clus- ters. To assume that Z39.50 will solve everything is faulty thinking. It is, after all, a mere technological device. What are the implications and does this push the lines of demarcation between the haves and have-nots even wider? The conceptual frame encompassing the to- Volume 35, Number 4
A Feminist Standpoint 309 tality of information and equal access to that totality is not being studied. Some feminists use photography and videotaping to collect and/or elicit data. We have not yet begun to grasp the potential of such methodologies in li- brary research. Deborah Brandt focused on four Peruvian women whose literacy development is documented in her photo-novella.46 What is clear is that these women gradually grow in politi- cal awareness as they learn to read. One characteristic to note is the conscious- ness-raising of both the women in the study and that of the investigator. Often research from a feminist perspective leads to direct action, that is, a change in policy or in the lives of participants. Interdisciplinarity and intercon- nectedness are characteristic of much in women's studies programs and re- search. Barriers of isolation have been thrown down and new linkages have been forged. One of the most important research contributions to be made is to use a form of meta-analysis to see what transfers from other disciplines are most appropriate. There is no question that women's studies and feminist scholarship have reached throughout academe. If we accept a new vision of history, literature, philosophy, and sci- ence, then we will have to accept that the structures of library and information science may need alteration to accom- modate new needs of the researcher and the student. If the historian/anthropolo- gist/English scholar is willing to accept the quilt, the pot, the decorative object, even personal decoration, as valid re- search data, what will we need to teach our students about research? What re- search will help us to identify needs that, in turn, will influence and em- power both our users and ourselves? In my years of directing doctoral research, I consistently encouraged and pushed my students to formulate their research in a rigorous and controlled fashion. This was obviously the result of my education and experience. I wanted all the research to be soundly based in theory and objective in report- ing. What I have come to recognize is the error of forcing objectivity and the need to openly value subjectivity. It is in feminist scholarship that I find support for this approach. Conclusion Finally, I present ten recommendations or challenges to each of you, hoping you will respond with positive action. 1. I recommend cooperative research, particularly feminist research, among library schools and hope that government and other agencies will be willing to fund such endeavors. 2 . I recommend that we work to incor- porate teaching styles that corre- spond more directly to the learning styles of our students and that femi- nist approaches to teaching be in- corporated in all courses. 3. I recommend that we cooperatively develop feminist units of study and make them available to all library schools. For instance, we should carefully examine our history and present female librarians as role models of theory and praxis. 4. I recommend cooperative teaching both within the classroom and through the use of the Internet as a teaching tool. For example, scenar- ios or cases could be assigned to students. Two or more faculty from different institutions and several practitioners from throughout the country could be asked to respond to student input. This probably would be designed as a group report Fall 1994
310 Journal of Education for Library and Information Science requiring only one set of responses rather than individual responses to each student. 5. I recommend that we move directly into an interdisciplinary mode. We should actively seek out colleagues in other disciplines and coopera- tively plan and implement feminist courses, workshops, and institutes. 6. I recommend the establishment of a women's study group in each li- brary school to address feminist theory and scholarship as well as issues of survival in academe. This group might establish connections with other campuswide women's studies groups. 7. I recommend the establishment of continuing education or profes- sional development programs, both campus and non-campus based, in- cluding distance education, that address issues of feminism in li- brarianship. 8. I recommend that professional edu- cators revitalize our relationship with alumnae and the practicing professional community to increase connectedness to practice. Much of the dialogue envisioned may take place through an individual listserv on a local Internet node that is open to alumnis and the practicing com- munity. 9. I recommend that we develop a means to share feminist informa- tion and materials to better advance our discipline and that we encour- age our colleagues in practice to do likewise. For instance, we might es- tablish, in conjunction with a cur- rent electronic archive such as that at the University of Maryland, elec- tronic space to house feminist syl- labi and feminist workshop materials for ease of retrieval by all. 10. I recommend that we do all in our power to increase the conscious- ness of feminist theory and praxis throughout the professional litera- ture. Let us make clear our concern to the editors of our journals and to the publishers of our books. We simply must develop a body of lit- erature for our field that is gender- fair and more truly representative of over half the population. Our profession is predominately fe- male and I find that a powerful image. We have the opportunity to set forth a revision of library and information sci- ence education and a model of informa- tion and service to the public in a unique and innovative fashion. Femi- nist theory and praxis offer so much to us as a profession that we cannot afford to ignore. My hope does not lie with the older generation of educators, but rather with the new generations of faculty and doctoral students that are our future. It will take intellectual study, energy, and personal bravery to embark on a course to alter the status quo of our profession. To those of you in senior positions as faculty and administrators, I hope you, too, will engage in this change process, but my even greater hope is that you will encourage and support your col- leagues who seek to advance the con- cept of women in our profession through their teaching, curricula change, and research. It only remains for all of us to do so. Acknowledgment No paper of this dimension is com- pleted without the help of many people. I particularly thank the many people who responded to my questions on the Internet and most specifically to those others who went out of their way to offer information, to listen, or to share ideas: Volume 35, Number 4

Elliott Kanner stresses the importance of gerontological research being incorpo- rated into library service and, in his dis- sertation, demonstrated the slowness in which research is incorporated into li- braries. In the introduction to Women and Aging: A Selected, Annotated Bibli- ography, Jean Coyle quotes a literature review from researchers and writers, which points out that, despite demo- graphic statistics that show that there are more women than men in the older popu- lace, women statistically live longer and are "thus more likely to end up living alone," and having "longer retirement pe- riods" than men; research has only re- cently begun to focus on older women.

Using various archives and through the kindness of colleagues, I have been able to locate ten syllabi that combine aspects of feminism and librarianship. The earli- est syllabus is from a 1977 course taught at Dalhousie University, and the most recent are from Rutgers University, the University of Wisconsin/Madison, and the University of Rhode Island in 1993. Some of the syllabi were for specific courses in women's studies in librarian- ship or a feminist integration with areas such as children's literature and young adult literature. 34.
