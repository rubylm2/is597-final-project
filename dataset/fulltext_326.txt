Library and Information Studies Faculty in Canada A Sex Ratio Study Hope Olson and Toni Samek This study looks at the sex ratio of women to men and related factors among library and information studies faculty in Canada by profiling 1971/72 and 1991/92 for comparison. The twenty-year span is intended to reflect the impact of feminism, the advent of automation, two-year master's programs, LIS doctoral programs, the 1972 accreditation standards, and faculty turnover. Primary sources of information are the 1971/72 directory issue of Journal of Education for Librarianship and the 1991/92 directory issue of Journal of Education for Library and Information Science, as well as library school catalogs. The sample comprises the entire population of full-time faculty in the seven currently accredited programs. Academic rank, doctorates held, and areas of teaching specialization are explored to identify differences between women and men. The findings indicate that the Canadian sex ratio, which is the reverse of the figures for North America in general, was the same in 1991/92 as in 1971/72. However, women and men have become more evenly distributed by rank and by area of teaching specialization. Recommendations for future research include a qualitative look at what influence sex ratio of LIS faculty has on students. Faculty are key participants in deter- mining education for library and infor- mation studies (LIS) in Canada. Laurent-G. Denis noted that "they virtu- ally control the entrance to the profes- sion."1 An important factor in LIS fac- ulty's influence on LIS students and practitioners is that of potential role models. A survey done at the School of Library and Information Studies, Uni- versity of Wisconsin-Madison, found statistical evidence that female role models have a greater influence on women students than do male role mod- els. Comments from respondents indi- cated that the students intended to fol- low in the footsteps of their role models.2 A recent work by Mary Niles Maack and Joanne Passet has drawn at- tention to the importance of women mentors in the academic environment of library and information science.3 Are there enough women faculty to go around? The sex ratio of LIS students is quite different from that of LIS faculty in accredited programs. In North Amer- ica, the percentage of women to men enrolled in accredited master's pro- grams from 1976 to 1979 was 80 percent women and 20 percent men, but the ratio of LIS faculty in 1975/76 was 41.5 percent women to 58.5 percent men.4»5 In the fall of 1991, over a decade later, the ratio for students was 79 percent Spring 1995 155

The emphasis in more recent research, Canadian and otherwise, has been on curricula rather than faculty.7 Our study is designed to explore factors about LIS faculty in the seven schools in Canada that have ac- credited programs: University of Al- berta, University of British Columbia, Dalhousie University, McGill Univer- sity, Université de Montréal, University of Toronto, and University of Western Ontario. This study is exploratory and descriptive, with the aim of finding the questions about the Canadian situation that are worthy of more in-depth re- search. The focus chosen is the ratio of women to men among LIS faculty. Our interest was prompted by the signifi- cance of mentors/role models and by the changes in society in relation to women in the last twenty-five years. The low percentage of women in the academy compared with the population in general raises a parallel issue of what an appropriate sex ratio in teaching is for a predominantly female profession. An initial examination discovered that the ratio of women to men for LIS fac- ulty in Canada was virtually the same in 1991/92 (55 percent women to 45 per- cent men) as in 1971/72 (54 percent: 46 percent). The constancy of this sex ratio in Canada over this long period is sur- prising. It requires the examination of other factors, including faculty rank, doctoral degrees held, and areas of teaching specialization within LIS in the search for an explanation. The ques- tion we are addressing is: With major changes in LIS, LIS education, and soci- ety in the twenty years under considera- tion, why has there not been a signifi- cant difference? Is this lack of change an indication of stagnation in Canadian LIS education or is something else at work? Background and Purpose of the Study Sex Ratio Previous studies of the sex ratio of LIS faculty, students, and professionals have been done primarily in the United States. Usually, in the case of faculty and students, they have encompassed all of the institutions having American Library Association (ALA)-accredited programs, thus including the Canadian institutions. It would be a mistake, how- ever, to assume that the Canadian situ- ation is the same as that in North Amer- ica generally. Table 1 shows that while other populations have shown changes, LIS faculty in Canada have not. In relation to LIS faculty, Mary Biggs reported that in 1965/66 the ratio was 53 percent women to 47 percent Volume 36, Number 2
Library and Information Studies Faculty in Canada 1 57 men.8 By 1975/76 it had more than re- versed and stood at 41.5 percent women to 58.5 percent men. In 1991/1992, 47.5 percent of LIS faculty were women.9 Thus, North American statistics have shown a very gradual increase in the percentage of women LIS faculty. Denis surveyed Canadian LIS fac- ulty. With a 72.8 percent return on his questionnaires he reported 37.5 percent female and 62.5 percent male LIS fac- ulty.10 We have been unable to locate a major study of this group done since then in Canada. Therefore, in examin- ing the literature on the variable of sex ratio we look for comparisons with populations that combine at least two of the three variables characterizing the population under study: the field of LIS, the profession of university faculty, and the geographic entity of Canada. It is possible to find examples of studies de- scribing the sex ratio of populations with each of the three possible combi- nations of two of these variables: group A, LIS faculty; group B, librarians in Canada; and group C, faculty in Canada. Figure 1 shows the three variables and their areas of overlap. Each of these ar- eas has shown change as documented in table 1. Why not the core where they all overlap? Rank Related to the overall sex ratio of LIS faculty is the ratio at specific academic ranks. Generally, higher rank is an indi- cator that an individual has been a fac- ulty member for a longer time and is more productive in terms of teaching and research. The preponderance of a group at the lower ranks indicates the potential for that group to reach the higher ranks within a certain range of years. Across disciplines women fac- ulty in Canada (group C) are generally found in greater numbers at the lower ranks. In 1969/70 3 percent of Canadian professors, 8 percent of associate pro- fessors, and 14 percent of assistant pro- fessors were women.11 In 1990/91, 8 percent of professors, 20 percent of as- sociate professors, and 33 percent of assistant professors were women.12 The increase is greatest at the bottom and Figure 1 .

The prospect implied is that if women continue to come into the university at a similar rate, the current 20 percent of faculty at Canadian uni- versities who are women, compared with 13 percent in 1969/70 (see table 1) will continue to gradually increase as will the numbers at higher ranks as women follow the academic career path. LIS faculty in North America (group A) showed an increase in women at the professor and assistant professor ranks between 1975/76 and 1979/80 ac- cording to a study done by Kathleen Heim.13 She expresses optimism that this will show a continued increase in women faculty as those at the rank of assistant professor progress and other women are also hired. However, this situation will also be affected by the retirement of women who are full pro- fessors.14 Therefore, prediction is not simple.15 In fact, looking at the statis- Volume 36, Number 2 Population Date of Data Women (%) Men (%) Group A US faculty- North America 1965/66 53.0 47.0° US faculty- North America 1 975/76 41 .5 58.5b US faculty- North America 1 991 /92 47.5 52.5C Group B Librarians-Canada 1971 76.0 24.0d Librarians- Canada 1991 82.0 18.0e Group C Faculty, all disciplines- Canada 1969/70 13.0 87.0f Faculty, all disciplines- Canada 1991 20.0 80.09 Core Group US Faculty- Canada 1971/72 54.0 46.0 US Faculty-Canada 1991/92 55.0 45.0h

While these ratios include Cana- dian programs, it cannot be assumed that the Canadian situation is reflected in them, since the overall sex ratio for Canadian LIS faculty is roughly inverse to that of LIS faculty in North America generally (see table 1). However, they offer an indication that this group shows a fluctuation rather than con- stancy in regard to one factor of the overall picture, rank. So while the sex ratio of faculty in Canada (group C) may have changed, the sex ratio of LIS fac- ulty in North America (group A) in terms of rank has become closer to its earlier proportion in a period similar to that covered by our study. Doctorates Having a doctorate affects hiring and tenure decisions for faculty positions so that the sex ratio of faculty having doc- torates may affect the overall sex ratio of faculty. Universities in general now require a doctorate at least for tenure, if not for the initial appointment. As a result, LIS faculty are increasingly likely to have a doctorate whether in LIS or some other field. In 1972 fewer than half of LIS faculty (group A) had doctorates.17 However, by 1991/92 this had increased to 82.9 percent.18 Women have made greater gains than men, so that while women previously had a much lower percentage of doctorates (50.9 percent of women as contrasted with 69.3 percent of men in 1977) they are now very close in percentage (81.2 percent of women and 84.4 percent of Table 2 Library Faculty in North America by Rank and Sex* 1975/76 1979/80 1991/92 (%) (%) (%) Deans/ Directors Women 19.7 20.9 41.0 Men 80.3 79.1 59.0 Professors Women 29.5 32.6 29.0 Men 70.5 67.4 71.0 Associate Professors Women 45.7 38.7 51.0 Men 54.3 61.3 49.0 Assistant Professors Women 46.0 51.4 47.0 Men 54.9 48.6 53.0 * Percentages for 1975/76 and 1979/80 are from Heim, "Demographic and Economic Status."

Specializations A final relevant factor in looking at the sex ratio is that of specialization within LIS. The connection between sex and specialization dates back to the Wil- Spring 1995
160 Journal of Education for Library and Information Science liamson reports on library education of 1921 and 1923. 22 Then the recommen- dation was made that library schools be moved from the public library setting, where faculties were predominantly fe- male, to the patriarchal university model. There were at least two assump- tions at play. First, the shift from voca- tion to profession would lend librarian- ship more prestige. In this respect, Roma Harris points out that "univer- sity-based education" is a defining characteristic of a profession and that education, as status, is particularly con- troversial for the feminized profes- sions.23 Second, with the shift from vo- cational to professional university-based education, the sex ratio of library school faculties would shift. Mary Niles Maack suggests that these changes had a nega- tive impact on the status of women fac- ulty.24 The studies mentioned below lend credence to this suggestion, as they illustrate how schools are most inter- ested in hiring in the area of "information," a predominantly male specialization. Concentrations of women and men in different specializations can have an impact on the sex ratio in hiring. Heim surveyed deans and directors of accred- ited LIS programs in 1985 and found that they were most interested in hiring faculty (in order of preference) in infor- mation science, information resources management, children's services, and public libraries.25 James D. Ramer, Philip M. Turner, and J. Gordon Coleman stud- ied whether candidates for positions were more likely to approach employ- ers or whether deans or directors were more likely to approach possible candi- dates. They found no difference on the basis of sex, but did find that people specializing in information science were more likely to be sought out than other specializations.26 These results mesh with Heim 's finding that informa- tion science was the most wanted spe- cialization and coincide with the addi- tion of the word "information" to the names of library schools. While de- mands for different specializations may change, these two studies indicate that specialization is an important factor. Certain areas have been found to be predominantly female or predomi- nantly male in a number of previous studies. In the major study done of LIS faculty in North America women were found to predominate in cataloging and children's, young adults', and school librarianship, while men predominated in information science, automation, re- search methods, and the history of books, printing, and libraries. In that study Roma Harris, Gillian Micheli, and Carol Cooley chose five benchmark years from 1965 to 1983.27 While the mix varied somewhat, the differential among the above-mentioned specializa- tions was fairly constant. Many more studies have looked at specializations among LIS students and practitioners that confirm these links between sex and specialization.28 A Ca- nadian study of Ontario librarians (a subset of group B) was done in 1979 by Kenneth Plate and Jacob Siegel.29 It not only shows largely similar results, but combines students and practitioners by looking at specializations in library school courses taken and in first and second professional jobs held. The one difference from studies considering all of North America is that in Plate and Siegel's findings women are not as con- centrated in cataloging. As with the previously mentioned factors, little work has been done recently in Canada, so exploration is overdue. Historic Context This study examines the sex ratio of women to men and the related factors of academic rank, doctorates held, and teaching specializations among LIS fac- Volume 36, Number 2

The two-decade span was chosen in or- der to cover the impact of feminism, the advent of automation, two-year master's programs and LIS doctoral programs, changes instituted by the 1972 accredi- tation standards, and faculty turnover. These educational, professional, and social changes make the similarity in sex ratio between the beginning and end of this period particularly puzzling. Feminism Feminism became a significant factor within LIS in the 1970s. In ALA there was considerable activity beginning in 1970 that gradually involved not only ALA itself, but also most of its divi- sions.30 In Canada, the Emergency Li- brarian, a small magazine "feminist to [its] very core," began publication in 1973. 31 The Canadian Library Associa- tion established a Status of Women Committee that same year and Cana- dian Library Journal featured an inter- view with Sherrill Cheda on feminism and librarianship in 1974, demonstrat- ing that feminism was an element in mainstream librarianship in Canada (group B) by the mid-1970s.32 By 1977 it had become a factor in education for LIS when the program at Dalhousie offered a course on feminist re- sources.33 Feminism was also having a major impact on all faculty in Canadian uni- versities (group C). For example, at the Second National Conference on Women in the University held at Queen's Uni- versity in Kingston, Ontario, in 1973 (a significant event in its own right) re- ports were given detailing the actions toward equity of both the Canadian As- sociation of University Teachers (the collective body of faculty associations in Canada) and the Association of Uni- versities and Colleges in Canada (the collective body of university admini- strations).34 Thus, feminism was important in both aspects of the profession of LIS faculty in Canada, the field of librarian- ship and the status of women faculty on Canadian campuses. In this context, feminism should also have been a factor in determining the sex ratio of LIS fac- ulty in Canada, and change should have occurred during the period we are con- sidering. Automation Feminism must be considered in con- junction with other factors at play be- tween 1971/72 and 1991/92. This pe- riod also saw the widespread development of automation in LIS. Some developments occurred during the 1960s, such as the Library of Con- gress distribution of machine-readable cataloging on magnetic tape in MARC format and the establishment of DIA- LOG. However, the great burgeoning of automation came in the 1970s and has continued uninterrupted. OCLC was founded in 1971, COM catalogs were developed in the early 1970s, turnkey local systems emerged in the mid- 1970s, integrated systems in the 1980s, and CD-ROMs in the 1980s.35 In Canada two key events were the founding of Utlas in 1973 and the adoption of DOBIS by the National Library of Canada in 1976 and its implementation in 1980. As a result, automation has become a major compo- nent of education for LIS and an in- creasingly frequent area of specializa- tion for LIS faculty, which, as mentioned above, is predominantly male. Two-year Master's Programs and US Doctoral Programs Another development that may have changed the complexion of LIS pro- grams in Canada was the adoption of the Spring 1995
1 62 Journal of Education for Library and Information Science two-year master's by all seven programs between 1965 and 1976. One effect might have been a greater interest and activity by faculty in their specializa- tions as a result of teaching more courses beyond the introductory level, bringing about a greater orientation to- ward research and contributing to the increased demand for doctorates.36 LIS doctorates became more avail- able to Canadians with the estab- lishment of programs at the University of Toronto in 1971 and the University of Western Ontario in 1973. 37 As both of these programs began to produce Ph.D.'s in the mid-1970s the availability of Canadian programs may have en- hanced the level of doctorates held by LIS faculty in Canada (though it must be remembered that many LIS faculty have doctorates in other relevant fields). Accreditation A further factor, reflecting and reinforc- ing the climate of equality prevailing in the early 1970s, was the antidiscrimina- tion statement introduced in the 1972 Standards for Accreditation of the American Library Association Commit- tee on Accreditation, which accredits Canadian as well as U.S. programs. It reads: Discrimination because of age, race, color, creed, religion, physical disabil- ity, or sex in recruitment, admissions, or financial aid, or in appointment, promo- tion or pay of faculty and support staff, shall be a violation of these Standards.38 These standards were in effect from the beginning of the period that we are considering in this study. Turnover A further reason for our selection of this twenty-year span was the likelihood of a turnover sufficient for reflection of a change in hiring patterns. In the event there was, indeed, a turnover of ap- proximately 78 percent. Only eighteen faculty members were included in both the eighty-two full-time LIS faculty in Canada in 1971/72 and the eighty in 1991/92. 39 Collection of Data The main sources of data for this study were the directory issues for 1971/72 of the Journal of Education for Librarian- ship and for 1991/92 of the Journal of Education for Library and Information Science, as well as library school calen- dars (or catalogs) and the ALISE Library and Information Science Education Statistical Reports. The directory issues were chosen because of the availability of relatively compatible data in the di- rectories for the benchmark years cho- sen and because studies of LIS faculty often use these directories, allowing for future comparison of results. In particu- lar, Harris, Micheli and Cooley, and Clare Beghtol used the directories in their studies of specializations and noted that with 1971/72 library auto- mation and data processing became a category, thus confirming our use ofthat year as a benchmark.40 The library school calendars were used as supple- mentary sources of information. Our sample is the entire population of full-time faculty in the seven cur- rently accredited programs. Part-time faculty were not included because their status varies considerably from one uni- versity to another. Also, the program at the University of Ottawa was excluded from the 1971/72 statistics because it closed in 1973.41 Shortcomings of these data sources were the omission of specializations for some faculty, particularly from the 1971/72 directory, and the lack of avail- ability of information regarding doc- toral degrees held by faculty at some Volume 36, Number 2
Library and Information Studies Faculty in Canada 1 63 institutions, again for 1971/72. Another problem was the change in the classifi- cation of specializations between the 1971/72 and 1991/92 directories. The latter had more categories than the for- mer, so direct comparison was not pos- sible. None of these shortcomings was serious in view of the exploratory na- ture of this study, in which the numbers are to identify areas of interest rather than to test hypotheses. Neither should they hamper future research unduly, be- cause a qualitative approach will prob- ably be more appropriate than a statis- tical one (see "Recommendations for Future Research," below). Findings Sex Ratio There are two interesting aspects to the simple ratios of women to men among LIS faculty in Canada (see table 3). First, they are almost precisely the reverse of the figures for LIS faculty in North America in general (group A).42 Second, there is no appreciable difference be- tween the numbers for 1971/72 and for 1991/92, in spite of the many changes in education for LIS and related factors described above. Rank The changes in sex ratio within aca- demic ranks showed a percentage in- crease for women in professor, associate professor, and "other" ranks (see table 4). "Other" consisted of full-time lectur- ers and instructors. The percentage of men increased in the rank of assistant professor. However, there was a general increase in assistant professors and as a result there were more women in that category as well. Various observations arise from these data. First is the doubling in num- ber of women professors. Another is the overall leveling between women and men at each rank and the leveling of the totals between ranks so that the num- bers of professors, associates, and assis- tants are generally closer to each other than they were in 1971/72. The 1991/92 column shows numbers approaching 50 percent to a greater degree than does the 1971/72 column. In evaluating these data, the profession and the academy need to decide whether the sex ratio of LIS faculty should reflect the popula- tion at large (approximately 50:50) or the sex ratio of LIS students and practi- tioners (approximately 80:20). If the few studies on mentoring in LIS are generalizable, then it should be the lat- ter. However, the change between 1971/72 and 1991/92 shows women roughly equal to men in rank status, which presents a positive image to stu- dents regarding the role of women in LIS and offers more senior women fac- ulty as potential role models. An exception to the leveling out of these numbers is "other." The status of instructor or lecturer is very much tied to local and even individual context. This category has now become exclu- sively female (as well as smaller). To appreciate fully what this situation means in terms of the status of women as LIS faculty would also require evalu- ation of part-time "other" faculty on an individual basis (see "Recommenda- tions for Future Research," below).

164 Journal of Education for Library and information Science Table 4 US Faculty in Canada by Rank and Sex Doctorates Unfortunately, insufficient information was available for 1971/72 to produce relevant data for comparative purposes because of the unavailability of some library school calendars from that year. However, for 1991/92 data were avail- able. In that year twenty-nine women (66 percent of all female LIS faculty in Canada) and twenty-five men (69 per- cent of male LIS faculty) held doctor- ates. While these percentages are very close to each other, in this area the Ca- nadian figures lag behind the North American figures of 81.2 percent and 84.4 percent for women and men, re- spectively. One reason that could be ex- amined in future research is the exist- ence of only two LIS doctoral programs in Canada, both of which are in Ontario. Specializations The following clusters of teaching spe- cializations are placed together accord- ing to the categories that correspond closely between the 1971/72 and 1991/92 directories. The classification of specializations has changed peri- odically, and in the twenty years be- tween our two sets of data the categories have multiplied from seventeen to sev- enty-three. Presented in table 5 are those areas that show women or men to be predominant in at least one of the years being examined. Because of the small numbers in each category and the close totals for each year, only female- male ratios are given, and not percent- ages. Teaching specializations show the traditional divisions in this data. Be- tween 1971/72 and 1991/92 women in Canada have become more active in cataloging and classification, bringing their situation closer to that in North America in general, and have main- tained their overwhelming responsibil- ity for children's, young adults', and school librarianship. Men have contin- ued to predominate in library automa- tion. The areas of information science and historical study have shown an equalization, and that of research meth- ods has shown an interesting turn- around with more men in 1971/72 and more women in 1991/92 giving it as an area of specialization.43 The rise of women in the theoretical area of infor- mation science and services and the in- crease of women in research methods could be linked to more of the women having pursued doctorates than pre- viously.

Conclusions Our aims in this exploratory study were to explain the apparently stable sex ra- tio in Canadian LIS faculty and to iden- tify areas for future research. As a result of this research it is reasonable to state that the unchanged sex ratio of LIS fac- ulty in Canada is not due to an un- changed situation.

166 Journal of Education for Library and Information Science result of a balancing of factors such as the impact of feminism on the field and on universities, the rise of automation, the two-year master's programs, matu- ration of faculty, increased access to doctoral programs, and antidiscrimina- tion as a factor in accreditation. Changes in rank show a possible stabi- lization with more even distribution of women and men within ranks. The same seems to be true for doctorates held and for at least some areas of spe- cialization (automation and children's, young adults', and school librarianship being the exceptions). An interpretation requiring only moderate optimism puts LIS faculty in Canada well on the way toward a 50:50 sex ratio in all respects. However, caution suggests that further research is needed to draw conclusions in an area of such complexity. Recommendations for Future Research Several possible avenues for future re- search have presented themselves in this study. Three of them are fundamen- tal questions. First, why are there more female than male LIS faculty in Canada when the reverse is true in overall North American statistics? Second, why is there so little change in teaching spe- cialization in children's, young adults', and school librarianship? Third, and most basic, what influence does the sex ratio of LIS faculty have on LIS stu- dents? Research literature in this area of LIS might benefit from the importation of research from other fields regarding mentoring and gender. Imported con- cepts might help answer questions such as: Does the sex ratio of faculty affect specialization? ambition? research po- tential? completion of the program? Do rank and status contribute to the effec- tiveness of role models? Has a more even distribution of women and men among most teaching areas changed pat- terns of specialization among students? Any of these questions would also bene- fit from analysis of American influence on aspects of Canadian education for LIS, or Canadian influence on the United States (such as the two-year master's programs). Other more specific questions also arise. In what teaching specializations has there been turnover and why? Are women who specialize in research methods recent Ph.D.'s? Why was cata- loging and classification evenly divided in 1971/72 in Canada when it has been predominantly female in other places and recently in Canada? Does this change show an increase in U.S. influ- ence on Canadian librarianship? Two other categories for future re- search come from factors outside of, but related to, this study. The first, part- time and "other" faculty, is of particular importance, since this category is likely to expand given the trend toward fewer tenure-track positions in Canadian uni- versities. Four questions arise regarding this group. Is there a difference in sex between part-time faculty who are prac- titioners as well and those who are ex- clusively part-time faculty? How rap- idly do people move in and out of this group, and is turnover related to sex? In a given situation, who are full-time "other" and who are part-time? How does this situation vary between univer- sities? The second area that is related to, but outside of, our study is that of sex differences in terms of tenure. The ALISE statistics indicate that in 1991/92 far more male than female assistant profes- sors already had tenure. Because differ- ent universities make different links be- tween rank and tenure, statistics alone cannot reveal clearly the situations this data might indicate. All of these possibilities for future research are unlikely to be satisfied Volume 36, Number 2
Library and Information Studies Faculty in Canada 1 67 with statistical inquiry alone. The rela- tively small population of LIS faculty in Canada and the many factors that may interact make comparative or historical research using interviews or case stud- ies or other qualitative approaches more likely methodologies for discovering more about Canadian LIS faculty. The anticipated retirement of large numbers of LIS faculty in the near future due to the graying of existing faculty, along with concern about shortages of LIS doctoral recipients, makes possible changes in characteristics of faculty of escalating importance.44 The research topics that we have identified will take on increasing urgency for LIS faculty, especially in their role as gatekeepers to the profession.

Isolated indicators of more rapid change have oc- curred from time to time. In 1987/88, fifty-eight new appointments were made in ALA-accredited schools, of which thirty-four were women and twenty-four men (59 percent and 41 percent respec- tively). And in a study of competitions for six positions at the School of Library Sci- ence at the University of Michigan, three each in 1973 and 1976, there was a dra- matic increase of 33 percent in female applicants.

All percentages are of the total popula- tion except as otherwise indicated, and they are calculated to the nearest whole number. 43. In 1991/92 this category also included the equivocal attribute of "service" (see table 5), which may have made the results uncomparable. For example, while Harris, Micheli, and Cooley ("Gender Gap") cate- gorize service as a traditionally female attribute, Beghtol ("Gender Gap in Publi- cation") argues that all of library and in- formation science is a "service industry." 44.
