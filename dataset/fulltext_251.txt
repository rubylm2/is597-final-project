THE IMPACT OF UNIONS ON SALARIES IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES' Mary Rosenthal2 The objective of this study was to test the following hierarchical regression model: a library employee's salary is a function of (1) the size of the library, (2) the strength of public sector collective bargaining in the state, (3) the library's ability to pay, (4) the cost of living in the area, (5) the presence of any union in the library, and (6) the presence of a union representing librarians in the library. The model was tested on three salary levels: those of the department head, the beginning librarian, and the clerical worker. Results indicate that librarian union presence explains 5-14 percent of the variation in librarians' salaries. No significant amount of variation in the salaries of department heads or clerical workers is explained by librarian union presence. Simple union presence can explain 1 1-17 percent of the variation in the salaries of clerical workers. Simple union presence does not explain any of the variation in the salaries of librarians or department heads. Introduction The drives to organize unions in libraries have been part of the general drives to organize unions among workers in the United States. The first library unions were formed just before 1920 when there was a great deal of union activity in response to the postwar economy [1, p. 492]. The second wave of library union organizing efforts paralleled the growth of unions in the industrial sector of the economy during the 1930s and 1940s. With the social change of the sixties and changes in legislation 1. This study was made possible by a grant from the University of Minnesota Computing Center. 2.

IMPACT OF UNIONS ON SALARIES 53 affecting public employees, there came another wave of efforts to orga- nize the librarians. These organizing drives have left only one-tenth of the public librari- ans unionized by 1975 [2, p. 43]. There are several explanations for this low figure. First of all, the majority of librarians are women, and women are less frequently represented by unions than are men [3]. Librarians work within institutions where they form a small proportion of the total work force. This also can hinder their organization into a collective bargaining unit. There are also subjective factors that act to block efforts at unionization. Because librarianship carries professional status, there is often a feeling that unions, with their blue-collar overtones, are inappro- priate vehicles for effecting changes for librarians. The professional association has been proposed as an alternative to the union for the librarian. The National Education Association (NEA) functions in this way for teachers. While retaining the veneer of "profes- sionalism," the association engages in collective bargaining for wages, fringe benefits, and better working conditions, as well as attending to its members' professional concerns. However, the American Library Asso- ciation (ALA), the professional association for librarians, has made no move in the direction of assuming that role for the librarian. Member- ship in its ranks is open not only to librarians but also to any person or organization interested in libraries, and it is not likely that this stance will change [4, p. 9]. In the absence of a professional association turned "quasi-union" [5], those public librarians who engage in collective bargaining find them- selves represented by a variety of organizations, such as the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), other unions, small professional associations, city employee groups, in- dependent local unions, and other bargaining units. Whether these unions have brought benefits to the employees they represent is the subject of this article. Problem Statement The purpose of this investigation is to determine the impact of unioniza- tion on the relative wages of public library employees in seven Midwest- ern states. Because other factors can influence the magnitude of wages (such as the size of the library, the extent of unionization in the area, and the ability of the institution to pay the work force), measures of these variables will also be taken to determine their impact on relative wages. This study will not attempt to determine the extent to which collective bargaining units are providing for the professional concerns of the
54 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY librarians they represent, nor will it deal with librarians' degree of satisfaction with their unions. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the presence of unions that represent librarians can explain any of the variation in salaries above and beyond the variation explained by other variables. Literature Review The number of articles written about library unions has increased over the past fifteen years. This increase parallels the growth of unionization in libraries. Much of it is narrative, either detailing various organizing drives and bargaining efforts in libraries or arguing the pros and cons of professional librarians' organizing into unions. Three major papers have investigated the history and development of library unions in this coun- try [1, 6, 7]. Five broad areas relating to library unions have been the subjects of recent research. The first deals with the factors that influence the forma- tion of library unions. Guyton's survey determined that the formation of unions in libraries was a function of the size of the library, the existence of legislation granting public employees the right to bargain collectively, and the presence of trade union activity in the area [2, p. 177]. Another area that has been researched deals with the attitudes of librarians and library school students toward collective bargaining and unions. Both Guyton and Vignone found that younger and more educated librarians did not feel that collective bargaining was unprofes- sional [2, p. 176; 8, p. 151j. Surveys of librarians and library school students in the 1970s revealed a fairly constant percentage (37-42 percent) who would be willing to join a union if one existed in their workplace [5, p. 194; 9, p. 804; 10, p. 339; 11, p. 458]. Schlachter's surveys also indicated that the majority of librarians and library school students felt that the American Library Association should be the or- ganization to work aggressively to better their economic and profes- sional positions [5, p. 194; 10, p. 339; 11, p. 458]. Members of the Association of College and Research Libraries felt that their personal goals benefited more from collective bargaining than did their institutions' goals, according to a survey conducted by Carmack and Olsgaard [12, p. 1411. Librarians working under collective bargain- ing agreements felt that their right to appeal unfair practices, their salaries, and their fringe benefits had improved significantly as a result of collective bargaining. One area that has been only minimally investigated is the actual collective bargaining agreement and its provisions. The examinations
IMPACT OF UNIONS ON SALARIES 55 that have been conducted reveal contradictory findings. Belli and Ken- nedy (as reported by Schlachter) determined that the contracts of the surveyed public and academic libraries often ignored professional goals [I 1, p. 463]. Chaplan and Maxey found that both economic issues, such as salaries and pensions, and professional issues, such as education policy and general governance, were included in the agreements of surveyed institutions [13]. Another question that has just recently begun to be explored is the impact of unions on the productivity of libraries. Ehrenberg, Sherman, and Schwarz did not find that collective bargaining coverage had af- fected productivity significantly in municipal libraries except in the area of interlibrary loans, where the number was greater in unionized librar- ies [14]. This same study did not find that collective bargaining coverage was associated with higher wage rates. However, several other studies have found that unions do have an impact on the salaries and fringe benefits of library employees. Guyton presented evidence in his survey that the salaries of professional librari- ans in unionized libraries were higher than those in nonunionized librar- ies. However, the differences were not statistically significant, and the fringe benefits enjoyed by both groups were similar [2, p. 21]. In an analysis of salary data collected by the Office of Public Libraries and Interlibrary Cooperation, Minnesota, for its 1981 annual report, I found that unionized libraries paid significantly higher salaries to librari- ans and clerks than did nonunion libraries (significant at the .005 level). The number of paid sick days and paid holidays received by librarians was also significantly higher in unionized than in nonunionized libraries (.025 level) [15]. However, the number of libraries studied was less than the recommended sixty for the t-test. Also, factors other than union presence may have accounted for some of the wage and fringe benefit differences. Getz's survey of thirty-one of the largest public library systems in the United States (while admittedly not a random sample) demonstrated that libraries with collective bargaining agreements did pay statistically significant higher salaries than libraries without such agreements to employees in two specific job categories: the beginning clerical worker and the experienced librarian. (The wage differentials found were 22.6 percent and 16.4 percent, respectively.) No statistically significant wage differential was found to exist for the position of beginning librarian [16, p. 71]. The regression model developed by Getz to measure the union/ nonunion wage differential also found that the variables of cost of living and the strength of the public sector union movement were significant predictors of salary levels. The variable of public sector union strength
56 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY (measured by the percentage of government employees covered by collective bargaining contracts) was found to raise the fringe benefits of public library employees significantly. Getz felt that this might be due to either pattern setting or increased political effectiveness of the union at the state level. An examination of the literature in the field of economics reveals a number of studies on the union/nonunion wage differential. Lewis's landmark study in the early 1960s showed the union/nonunion wage differential in the private sector to fall between 10 percent and 15 percent. This figure is often used as the base to which other findings are compared [17]. A summary of the literature by Parsley, which concerned itself primarily with the private sector, indicated that, while studies show a differential does exist, there is debate as to its size and the reasons for it [18]. Part of the problem stems from the different variables used in the various studies. Another problem in many of the studies is that spillover effect (the effect that unions can have on wages in nonunion shops) is not accounted for in determining wage differentials. Wage differentials were also found to vary over time, due to changes in the economy. Differences between union and nonunion wages also varied according to industry, occupation, sex, race, and region of the country studied. Mitchell's review of the literature determined that not only do unions significantly raise wages above nonunion levels for comparable workers but also the earnings in the heavily unionized sector grow at a faster rate [19, p. 61]. Findings also showed that the heavily unionized sector was characterized by higher expenditures on fringe benefits in relation to total compensation, larger establishments, a lower proportion of women in the work force, and a lower rate of turnover. There have also been a number of studies investigating the impact of unions on wages in the public sector. Three reviews of the literature concluded that, for the most part, unions have had some positive impact on relative wages [20-22]. The extent of this impact has been found to vary widely, from 0-3 percent to 2.3-28.8 percent, depending on the group surveyed and the method used. Perry concludes that, while collec- tive bargaining has raised relative wages by a small amount, the labor market and the economic conditions in the area play a more significant role than does unionization [20, p. 22]. Such widely fluctuating results are problematical but, as Mitchell put it, they are "not very different from the general conclusions of comparable literature on private sector unionization" [21, p. 141]. One of the problems with many of the public sector studies is that, while fringe benefits are an important part of the public employees' pay package, they are often not considered in "wage" studies. Union impact is thus somewhat distorted.
IMPACT OF UNIONS ON SALARIES 57 Another problem that is encountered in public sector wage studies has to do with using an "ability to pay" variable in the analysis. Per capita receipts, or the tax mill rate, is often used as an ability to pay variable. This variable may influence the wages of public employees, but the direction of the relationship is not clear. As Mitchell points out, while high taxes may lead to high wages in the public sector, the reverse may also be true [21, p. 139]. Balkin's study found a 10 percent wage differential over time for four clerical positions in the public sector due to unionization [23]. Ability to pay wages, property tax rate, and the form of government of the municipality were not found to be significant in the variation of wages. Because this study surveyed only those governments in the metropolitan area of the Twin Cities, Minnesota, they were all exposed to the same potential spillover effects of unionization. From this review of the literature it can be seen that there is an interest in unions and collective bargaining on the part of librarians. While few of the studies had sample sizes that were large enough to support reliable conclusions, findings suggest that many librarians do want some sort of organization to look out for their economic and professional interests. Age and education appear to be factors in determining librari- ans' acceptance of using collective bargaining to gain these ends, and slightly more than one-third of the librarians surveyed favored joining unions. One study has supported the premise that librarians feel their personal goals vis-a-vis salaries and fringes have benefited from collec- tive bargaining [121. Studies of wage differentials in both the public and private sectors do show differences between union and nonunion wages, although the magnitude of the difference that can be attributed to the union has not been completely determined. Preliminary studies in the field of librari- anship also indicate that a difference exists, although, again, the amount of difference that can be attributed to union presence has yet to be determined. This study will attempt to measure the amount of variation in librarians' wages that can be explained by union presence. A number of factors emerge from these studies as affecting salary size in some way. These variables should be accounted for in any model that is developed to measure union impact on salaries. The first f;actor that appears to influence salary size is union presence. Because union pres- ence was found by Guyton to be associated with large libraries [21, size of the institution should be measured to determine whether it has a sepa- rate impact on salaries. The cost of living and the strength of collective bargaining in the public sector were found to be important predictors of wage variation by Getz [16]. They should also be included in any predictive model that is developed. The measure of the strength of collective bargaining in the
58 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY state will also help to account for any spillover effects from the union to the nonunion institutions. There has been evidence from both sides that the ability to pay variable is important in determining wages in the public sector [23, p. 55; 24]. Because it may explain some of the variation in salaries, it also should be included in the model. Objectives The objective of this study is to determine whether library unionization influences the wages of library employees. In order to determine the extent of this influence on relative wages, the influence of the cost of living in the area, the library's budget, the size of the institution, and the strength of the union movement in the area will also be measured. Hypothesis It is hypothesized that the variation in salaries of library employees can be explained in part by whether a union that represents librarians is present in the library. To determine the extent to which the librarians' union affects salaries, the following model was developed to test the hypothesis: y = Bo + BIFTE + B2WFO + B3TOTPC + B4COL + B5U + B6LU + E, where y = the annual salary for a position in a given library, Bo = a constant, FTE = the number of full-time equivalents employed by the library, WFO = the percentage of local government employees organized in the state, TOTPC = the total per capita receipts of the library, COL = the cost of living in the area, U = the presence of a union in the library, LU = the presence of a union in the library that represents librarians, and E = error. All the variables except union presence and librarian union presence will first be analyzed for their impact on salaries. Then union presence will be added to the equation to determine if its presence explains any additional variation in salaries over and above that which is explained by the first four variables. Finally, the presence or absence of a union that
IMPACT OF UNIONS ON SALARIES 59 represents librarians will be added to the equation. This last step will show whether any additional variation in salaries is explained by librar- ian union presence, above that amount of variation explained by the first four variables and simple union presence. This model concerns only union impact on salaries. While the model does identify other potential predictors of salaries, there is no attempt to rank them in order of their importance in explaining salary variation. Because of this, the order in which the first four variables are fed into the equation is not important. What is important is that union presence and librarian union presence are fed into the equation last. In this way it can be determined whether library union presence explains any more of the variation in salaries than was previously explained by the other variables. This model will be used to analyze librarian union impact on the salaries of three positions: those of the clerk, the beginning librarian, and the department head. Procedure Population and Sample In 1982 Carl Sandstedt, director of the St. Charles City-County Library in Missouri, sent approximately 200 questionnaires to public libraries and library systems in Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, and North and South Dakota. The questionnaires were sent to all public libraries in those states with budgets of over $100,000 per year. The same questionnaire was sent to all library systems and state library agencies regardless of the size of their budgets. The survey was primarily concerned with the salaries paid to employ- ees occupying seven positions in the library: the shelver, clerk, para- professional, librarian, department head, assistant director, and direc- tor. Data were also collected on the size of the library, its budget, how the budget was spent, and whether a union was present in the library. Of the 200 questionnaires sent out, 101 were returned from public libraries and eighteen responses were received from library systems and state agen- cies. The results of Sandstedt's survey were published in his 1982 Salavy Schedule of West-North-Central States [25]. In the present study the data collected by Sandstedt were submitted to a secondary analysis to determine the impact of unions on salaries. Instrumentation and Data Collection To determine the impact of the librarians' union on wages, other rele- vant variables were also measured. It is assumed that the cost of living will be reflected directly in the
60 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY wages in an area. Where the cost of living is high, wages are expected to be high. Data on the cost of living were taken from the American Chamber of Commerce Researchers Association's Cost of Living Index for the third quarter of 1982 [26]. Only those libraries which fell into the SMSAs listed in the Index were assigned a statistic. As coverage of the United States is not complete, only forty-six libraries had a cost of living variable. This led to problems with sample size which will be discussed in the section on data analysis. The size of the institution is another factor that can influence the setting of wages. This is partly because unions tend to form where there are large concentrations of workers. In an attempt to forestall this, employers will sometimes offer higher wages than they normally would. The number of full-time employees is used to determine size. Spillover effect is linked with another factor that can influence the setting of wages and that is the extent to which the work force as a whole is unionized. The spillover effect from unionized workers can act to drive up the wages of nonunion workers. The percentage of public sector employees unionized in the state was used to measure this vari- able. While this figure is not as specific to each library as would be desirable, it does give some indication of the strength of the public sector union movement on the state level. Given that bargaining rights for public employees are legislated at the state level, it is not an inappropri- ate measure to use. Data were taken from the Bureau of National Affair's Government Employee Relations Report [27, pp. 19-26]. The amount of money the library has in relation to the size of the library and its staff tends to be a critical factor in determining the level of wages paid to its employees. Libraries get varying amounts of support from their communities and the government. This support may go into higher salaries for employees or may be channeled into other parts of the library's budget. The per capita receipts of the library were used as an indication of its ability to pay. Mitchell's caveat, mentioned before, should be reiterated. The nature of the relationship between high reve- nues and high wages is still open to question. Wages were measured at three different levels: (1) clerical-the lowest annual salary paid to a starting clerical employee, (2) librarian-the lowest annual salary paid to new library school graduates with the M.L.S. degree, and (3) department head-the top rate paid to an employee who is not the director or assistant director of the library. Two union variables were measured. The first union variable con- sisted of a zero-one dummy variable, where one equaled the presence of a union in the library (excluding a union that represented only custo- dians) and zero equaled the absence of a union. The second union variable consisted of another zero-one dummy variable, where one
IMPACT OF UNIONS ON SALARIES 61 equaled the presence of a collective bargaining unit that represented librarians and zero equaled the absence of such representation for librarians. This distinction was made to determine the actual impact resulting from the unionization of librarians rather than any spillover effects on librarians from the presence of other unions in the library. Method of Analysis A hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the model developed for this study. In the first step, salary was regressed onto the following variables: number of full-time equivalents, percentage of the work force organized, per capita receipts, and the cost of living, which were entered in stepwise fashion. On the second step, the residual variation of the salary scale was regressed onto the residual variation of the first union variable (any union presence) and then onto the residual variation of the second union variable (librarian union presence). Findings Of the 114 libraries that responded to the questionnaire, twenty-one reported that a union operated in them. Eleven of these libraries had unions that represented librarians. In two of the eleven cases, the librari- ans' union was an autonomous unit, representing librarians solely. In the remaining nine cases the librarians had elected to be represented by the same bargaining unit as the other library employees (clerical or technical workers, for example). This is probably best explained by the size of the library and the number of librarians employed. The two libraries that have independent librarian unions are large libraries, one with 316 full- time equivalent employees (sixty-seven of whom are librarians) and the other with 155 full-time equivalent employees (twenty-six of whom are librarians). The nine libraries in which the librarians have chosen to be represented by the same unit as the other library employ between seven and seventy-one full-time equivalent employees and a proportionately lower number of librarians. Kleingartner discusses the appropriateness of mixed bargaining units for librarians [4, p. 13]. He points out that small groups simply do not have the necessary clout to bargain effectively. In smaller libraries, librarians may feel they have a better chance of making gains by affiliating with the unit composed of clerical and technical workers. Six of these mixed units that also represent librarians are affiliated with AFSCME, while three of them are affiliated with the Communica- tion Workers of America (CWA). Of the twenty-one unions found in the libraries surveyed, the majority
62 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY of them (twelve) are in Minnesota. This fact should not be surprising, given that 71 percent of its local full-time government work force is organized statewide. This compares with an organized local government work force of 48.5 percent in Iowa, 43.8 percent in Nebraska, 41 percent in South Dakota, 40.9 percent in North Dakota, 38.5 percent in Mis- souri, and 29.4 percent in Kansas. No library unions were reported in North Dakota, Kansas, or Missouri. An examination of the annual salaries for each of the three job positions shows that clerical salaries ranged from $6,097 to $12,209 per year, with a median annual salary of $7,904. Beginning librarians' salaries ranged from $6,097 to $19,769 per year, with a median annual salary of $13,252. Department heads' salaries ranged from $7,200 to $49,200 per year, with a median annual salary of $17,882. Table 1 compares the median annual salaries of the three job classifications on the basis of union and librarian union presence or absence. As can be seen from the table, union presence appears to be related to higher annual salaries in all three job categories. Presence of a librarians' union appears to be related to even higher salaries for the categories of librarian and clerk. It is just this variation that this study will examine. How much of this variation can be explained by such factors as the cost of living in the area or the per capita receipts the library receives? How much of the variation can be explained by general work force conditions such as how strong the union movement in the area is or how many employees work at the particular institution? Finally, how much of the variation can be ex- plained by the presence of a collective bargaining unit and the benefits it can win for its members? To answer these questions and test the hypothesis posed earlier, the model developed in the hypothesis section was applied to the salary data in each job category. However, because over half of the libraries did not have cost of living data available for them, it was decided to drop the cost of living variable from the model in order to increase the sample size. The hierarchical regression model used to test whether librarians' unions have an impact on the salaries of library employees thus became: y = Bo + BIFTE + B2WFO + B3TOTPC + B4U + B5LU + E, or that a salary is the function of the number of full-time equivalents in a library, the percentage of local government employees organized into unions, the per capita receipts of the library, the presence of a union, and the presence of a librarians' union in the library.

Application of the Five Variable Model to the Salaries of M.L.S. Librarians When this model was applied to the salaries of the M.L.S. librarians, the results reported in table 2 were obtained. The purpose of this study is to determine whether librarians' unions can explain any of the variation in salaries above and beyond that which is explained by the other variables in the model, some of which them- selves are associated with unionization. As can be seen from table 2, the presence of the variable LU (a union that represents librarians) explains an additional 5 percent of the variation in the annual salaries of the librarians surveyed, given the presence of the four other variables. A few words of caution should be stated here. This 5 percent variation is not the "wage differential" between union and nonunion libraries. To determine that differential requires a different procedure and is beyond the scope of this study. Another caveat is that while the 5 percent variation explained by the presence of a union representing librarians is statistically significant, the overall amount of variation explained by the model (28 percent) is not very great. The addition of other explanatory variables (such as prevailing wage rates, the health of the economy, the level of unemployment, tax levels, the prevalent political climate, etc.) could raise the amount of variation explained and very well might change the amount of variation that the librarians' union presence explains. Application of the Five Vanrable Model to the Salaries of Department Heads When this same model was applied to the salaries of the department heads, it was determined that the presence of a union representing librarians was not significantly related to their salaries (see table 3). Application of the Five Variable Model to Clerical Employees' Salaries Application of the model to the clerical salaries also showed that no significant amount of variation was explained by the presence of a

However the presence of any union (the variable U) does explain a significant portion (11 percent) of the variation in salaries. Application of this model, without the cost of living variable included, demonstrates that the presence of a union that represents librarians explains 5 percent of the variation of beginning librarians' salaries. No significant role in explaining department heads' salaries is played either by union presence or by librarian union pres- ence. No significant amount of variation in clerical workers' salaries is explained by librarian union presence. The presence of unions repre- senting other employees (some of which do represent the clerical work- ers as well) does have a significant impact on the clerks' salaries. With these findings in mind, we can now turn our attention to the first model developed (which included the cost of living as an explanatory

When the cost of living variable was included in the equation, the number of subjects that could be analyzed for each salary level was halved. Before applying the original model to this smaller set of data, it was important to determine whether this subsample differed from the original sample examined. Consequently, the sample of libraries was divided into two groups, those libraries for which cost of living data were available and those libraries for which these data were not available. T-tests between these two groups were conducted on the following three variables: the num- ber of full-time equivalents employed, the percentage of the public employee work force organized in the state, and the per capita receipts of the library. The results of these tests are reported in table 5. As can be seen, the libraries for which cost of living data were available employed significantly more full-time equivalents (at the .001 level) than those libraries for which these data were not available. The two groups do not show any significant difference in the areas of work force unionization or per capita receipts. With the understanding that the inclusion of the cost of living data effectively reduces the sample to approximately forty-five of the larger libraries (a subsample of the original that is both biased and too small, using Roscoe's [29, p. 184] recommended sample size of ten subjects per variable for multivariable analyses), the model originally developed in the hypothesis section was applied to the data. 'I'his model proposed that: y = Bo + B I FTE + B2WFO + B3TOTPC + B4COL + B5U + B6iLU + E, or that a salary is the function of the number of full-time equivalents in a library, the percentage of local government employees organized into

Application of the Six Variable Model to the Salaries of M.L.S. Libranians Applying this model to the data, the amount of variation in librarians' salaries explained rises to 54 percent. Given the presence of the other five variables in the model, the presence of a union that represents librarians explains an additional 14 percent of the variation (see table 6). While the total of 54 percent of the variation in salaries explained by this model is still not a large figure, it shows that librarian union pres- ence still explains a significant portion of the variation in salaries. Again, more complete models encompassing other economic factors may change this proportion, as might the inclusion of a broader sample of libraries. Application of the Six Variable Model to the Salaries of Department Heads As reported in table 7, an application of this model to the salaries of the department heads shows again that the presence of the librarians' union has no statistically significant relationship to their salaries. Application of the Six Variable Model to Clerical Employees' Salaries Clerical salaries were finally analyzed by this model. While the presence of librarians' unions does not explain a statistically significant amount of the variation using either model, the application of the Inodel to the smaller subsample does increase the variation that it explains by .01, as reported in table 8.

68 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY Unions representing librarians do add a slight amount of explanation of the variation using this model on the subset of larger libraries. The amount explained is not great, however. It is simple union presence that plays a very significant role in explaining wage variation using both models. Conclusions Because this study was a secondary analysis of data, sample groups were not as large as they should have been so that reliable conclusions could be drawn. Application of the models developed indicate that unions representing librarians do explain a small but significant portion of the variation in the salaries of M.L.S. librarians, given the presence of the other variables. No significant amount of variation was explained by librarians' unions for either the clerical or the department heads' salaries. The amount of variation in salaries explained by librarians' unions almost tripled when the model included the cost of living variable. This finding may be attributed not so much to the cost of living as to the fact that a subsample consisting of the larger libraries was used with the model. The presence of a collective bargaining unit representing any library employees does explain a significant amount of variation in the salaries of the beginning clerical worker. Union presence (that is, any union presence) does not explain a significant amount of variation in the salaries of beginning librarians or department heads. Given the model developed in this study, unions appear to have a positive impact on the salaries of those job positions they represent. Discussion This study was an attempt more scientifically to explore the impact that unions have on the salaries of library employees. While union impact is indicated, there is still quite a bit of variation in salaries that has not been explained by this investigation. It would be worthwhile to explore the other variables that have an impact on salaries and thus clarify even more the role that librarians' unions play. It would also be interesting to determine whether the results of this study hold true for other parts of the country. If such a study were conducted, an analysis of fringe benefits should be included, as they are
