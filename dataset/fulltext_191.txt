EMPLOYEE TURNOVER AMONG FULL-TIME PUBLIC LIBRARIANS Richard Rubin' Analysis of employee turnover is common in business and industry. Under- standing the cause and magnitude of turnover can help assess basic aspects of the organization such as the adequacy of pay, hiring practices and evaluation procedures, fairness of supervision, effectiveness of communication, and quality of leadership. Unfortunately, turnover analysis in librarianship is rare. The purpose of this study is to examine employee turnover in thirty-one public libraries in the Midwest. Particular emphasis is placed on establishing base-line turnover rates and examining the relationship of gender to turnover behavior. Among the findings are that (1) turnover rates are low compared to other occupations and (2) turnover rates of males and females are similar, but females are more likely to leave their jobs for family and personal reasons. To those librarians who think we have exhausted subjects for consideration and are frankly bored by A.L.A. meetings, I would respectfully suggest that a study of labor turnover in libraries would be desirable. Some of it could undoubtedly be prevented [ 1, p. 138]. [CHARLES COMPTON, 1929] 1. Introduction and Review of the Literature Employee turnover is generally defined as the crossing of the member- ship boundary of an organization [2, pp. 4-6]. It is most commonly characterized by voluntary resignation, termination, and retirement. Turnover is a subject of considerable study in the management and social science literature. Mowday reports that more than one thousand studies have been conducted on turnover since 1910 [3, p. 107]. The reason for the ubiquity of such studies is manifest: studying 1.

28 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY turnover provides important information on the health of organizations. High turnover may suggest, for example, poor employee selection prac- tices, inadequate training and supervision, discrimination, or poor sal- aries or working conditions. Employee turnover is also expensive to the organization. Cascio identifies three major sources of costs: (1) the cost of separation (for example, exit interviews, administrative activities, separation pay), (2) replacement costs (for example, advertising and interviewing), and (3) training costs for new employees (for example, informational literature, formal training, and training for the particular task) [4, pp. 17-32]. Cawsey and Wedley add the cost of lost productivity both as the employee prepares to leave the organization and in other staff who may be adversely affected by the employee's departure [5, p. 93]. The costs of employee turnover in librarianship may be considerable. Roos and Shelton estimated the cost of hiring one academic librarian in 1987 to be between $13,000 and $15,000 [6, p. 89]. Although this evidence is anecdotal, there are sufficient additional, albeit indirect, data to suggest that the cost may be substantial. Both King Research and Drennan and Darling have provided data on the number of librarians who leave their jobs. Drennan and Darling, in their 1966 study of the library labor force, report that of the 12,130 public librarians covered by their survey, 2,310 persons left the profession within a two-year period [7, p. 12]. This is an annual separation rate of 9.5 percent and does not include those who left their positions but remained in the work force. King Research, in its 1981 national study of library manpower, although not reporting turnover rates, did note that 17,200 librarians left their library positions in 1981 to seek other employment or leave the work force [8, p. 45]. This represented approximately 14 percent of the 126,000 librarians in the work force [8, p. 35]. Turnover Rates An important aspect of turnover analysis involves an analysis of turn- over rates. Unfortunately, annual turnover rates, even for business and industry, have not been systematically collected since the government stopped collecting them in 1968 [9, p. 26]. Generally, when rates are reported they are given by broad occupational categories rather than specific industry. Based on studies from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Civil Service Commission, and other sources, Price (tables 1 and 2) has summarized the available data on turnover rates for five types of organizations and by occupational group [2, p. 63]. Of particular note for librarians, Price's analysis of the turnover data revealed that the turnover rates of service workers are considerably lower than those of goods-producing workers [2, p. 63]. The small amount of data on library turnover rates supports this observation.

Rubin, in a pilot study of turnover among 104 full-time librarians from 1980-84 in three public libraries in Ohio, reported an annual turnover rate of 8.7 percent [10, p. 103]. Similarly, Neal studied academic librari- ans using data from the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) from 1983-86 [11]. Based on ninety-eight ARL libraries, and 1,658 librarians, Neal reported an annual turnover rate of 7.4 percent, with a mean tenure of 8.3 years [11]. Comparing these turnover rates to those in other industrial categories and occupational levels, it appears that turn- over rates among professional librarians are low. Gender and Turnover Often, research on turnover has focused on possible gender differences in male and female turnover rates. Generally, the relationship between gender and turnover is unclear. Barnes and Jones, in a general study of turnover behavior in the labor force using data from 1950-68, did in fact report that females had higher turnover rates than males and that, when they quit, they tended to leave the work force (inter-labor force mobility) in contrast to males who tended to take other jobs (intra-labor force mobility) [12]. In addition, they found that the largest proportion of female turnovers occurred between the ages of twenty and thirty-four and the ages of fifty-five and sixty-four. Females in the younger age bracket were more likely to exit the work force than those females in the middle-age brackets (thirty-five to fifty-four). Their primary reasons for leaving the work force were marriage, pregnancy, and child care [12, p. 445]. Among the older workers, cessation of financial responsibilities, poor health, and retirement were considered major factors in exiting the work force [12, p. 445]. It should be noted that the data analyzed by Barnes and Jones involved the general labor force and contained indus- trial positions wholly unlike positions in librarianship. Price has noted that, at least in one profession numerically dominated by females, nurs- ing, the turnover rate is quite high, 42-67 percent annually [2, p. 57]. There are, of course, many reasons other than gender why turnover rates are high among nurses.

Subsequent investigators have questioned the view that gender and turnover are directly related. Viscusi, noting the tenaciousness of the belief that females have weaker job commitment than males because of child-bearing and family responsibilities, cross-analyzed general labor force data from 1975-76 [13]. He found that the overall turnover rates for females were higher than those of males and that the turnover rates of females in professional job categories were three times those of males [13, p. 391]. However, the differences disappeared when employees in their first year of service were eliminated [13, pp. 388-89]. Significantly, Viscusi identified salary rather than gender as the central determinant of decisions to quit [13, pp. 394-95]. Similar rates were reported by Haber, Lamas, and Green, using labor force data involving wage and salary workers from 1978. Haber et al. reported higher turnover rates for females and higher rates of inter-labor force mobility for females [9]. However, like Viscusi, they also concluded that lower salaries created the differences in turnover rates [9, p. 23]. If, as the management literature suggests, low pay and family respon- sibilities affect turnover behavior, then one would suspect, all other factors being equal, that the turnover rates of female librarians would be greater than those of males. The documentation concerning gender differences in library salaries and the predominance of females in lower payingjob categories is commonplace [14, p. 23]. Yet, despite the wealth of information in the general management literature and the impor- tance of the subject, librarianship has produced little research either on turnover rates generally or on gender differences in turnover behavior. The King Research report, for example, provides no turnover rates or analysis of gender differences [8]. Rubin has provided limited data on gender differences in his study of public librarians. He reported annual turnover rates for males of 5.6 percent and for females 9.4 percent [10, p. 103]. The gender differences found in the library data were sufficiently great to be statistically significant at .10 but not at .05 [ 10, pp. 103-4]. In addition, Rubin found that, consistent with general labor force data, female librarians tended to leave the work force after quit- ting in disproportionate numbers when compared to their male coun-
EMPLOYEE TURNOVER 31 terparts [10, pp. 102-31. These findings suggested the need to investi- gate gender differences further. Although gender relationships and turnover behavior in librarianship have seldom been studied, a related area, the career progression of females, has received careful attention. These studies often examine as part of a broader analysis the reasons why women leave their jobs. Heim and Estabrook, for example, note that family responsibilities are more likely to affect the decision to quit for females than for males [15]. Reporting on 1,958 public, school, academic, and special librarians, they found that females were more apt to leave jobs to relocate or care for children than their male counterparts [15, pp. 28-3 1]. Braunagel, in her study of 462 academic librarians in the South, found that females were four times more likely to cite personal or family reasons for their resig- nations [16, p. 140]. Dickson, in her study of reentering librarians, found similar data: 63 percent of the females surveyed (N = 162) cited family reasons for leaving their last job [17, p. 5]. Despite these studies, however, little is actually known about the effect such factors as family responsibilities and low pay have on turnover rates of female librarians. Similarly, little is known about actual turnover rates in the library profession. The data reported here establish base-line turnover rates for full-time public librarians and examine gender differ- ences in turnover rates and behavior. 1I. Method Sixty-three public libraries serving a population of one-hundred thou- sand or more were invited to participate in the study. The libraries were located in seven Midwestern states: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Min- nesota, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin. The libraries were selected from the 1985 edition of Statistics of Public Libraries in the United States and Canada Serving 100,000 or More [18]. Thirty-one libraries (49 percent) agreed to participate, and they were sent data collection forms. These forms requested data on all full-time librarians who left their libraries voluntarily from January 1, 1980, to December 31, 1984. Retirements were included only if they were not mandatory. A librarian was defined as an individual who, in the judgment of the director, was performing tasks that in large part required master's level education, background, and training in library science. Possession of a master's degree in library science was not required. The forms were completed by the director, personnel director, or other administrative staff member. Among the data collected for each turnover were age, job tenure, marital status, possession of the master's of library science, reason for leaving, and destination after quitting. In addition, for each of the five years under
32 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY study data were requested on the total number of librarians hired categorized by gender, the number of professional librarians on staff, the number of male librarians on staff, and the salary of beginning librarians. Based on the data collected, annual turnover rates were calculated, and the relationship of turnover to such variables as age, gender, marital status, possession of a master's in library science, and tenure was analyzed. Turnover rates were calculated using the formula for the crude sep- aration rate [2, p. 15]: number of members who left during the period average number of members during the period III. Results Comparability of Institutional Respondents and Nonrespondents Comparability of respondent and nonrespondent libraries was mea- sured using seven institutional variables: population served, salary ex- penditures, beginning librarian's salary, budget expenditures per capita, ratio of personnel budget to total budget, number of librarians on staff, and total staff size. Student's t-tests for independent samples were ap- plied for each variable and by size of library. Size of library was divided into three categories: libraries serving 100,000-249,999 (Size 1, N = 18); 250,000-499,999 (Size 2, N = 6); and 500,000 or more (Size 3, N = 7). A summary of the data for respondents and nonrespondents is provided in table 3. Overall, only one statistically significant difference was found at the .05 level. This was in budget per capita (t = 2.24, P < .03). Respondent libraries (N = 31) tended to be wealthier, with a mean per capita expenditure of $15.84, while nonrespondent libraries (N = 31) had a mean per capita expenditure of $12.83. When budget per capita was analyzed by size of library, only in the smaller Size 1 libraries was the difference significant (t = 2.01, P = .05). The budget per capita of respondents (N = 18) in the Size 1 libraries was $14.73, for nonre- spondents (N = 22), $11.39. In Size 2 libraries, the relationship was reversed with respondents (N = 6) having a per capita expenditure of $14.39, and nonrespondents (N = 5), $16.09. In Size 3 libraries, per capita expenditures for respondents (N = 7) was $19.95, for nonrespon- dents (N = 4), $14.37. The low sample sizes for Size 2 and 3 libraries diminish the power of the t-test to detect differences, hence one must be cautious about interpreting the findings of insignificance. Based on the data analysis, however, it is assumed that overall, the respondents and nonrespondents were similar, although special care must be exercised

It is possible that wealth of the library may limit the generalizability of the data. Selected Characteristics of the Individual Turnovers A total of 421 individual turnovers were recorded in this study: 84 percent were female, 16 percent male; 56 percent were married, 44 percent unmarried; 75 percent possessed the master's in library science, 25 percent did not; 62 percent were performing the work of librarians, 31 percent were department or branch heads, and 8 percent were administrators. Age.-Table 4 provides means, standard deviations and medians for age overall and by size of library. The mean age was forty-four years, the median thirty-nine. A substantial proportion (43 percent) of the turn- overs were under the age of thirty-five. Size I libraries were found to have mean ages that were significantly lower (F = 3.87, P < .02). No

Tenure.-Similarly, a substantial proportion (36 percent) of the turn- overs had worked with the library five years or less (table 5). Approxi- mately 25 percent of all turnovers occurred within the first 3.5 years of service. As with age, analysis by size of library revealed that tenure was significantly lower in the smaller (Size 1) libraries (F = 14.1 1, P < .01). No statistically significant differences were found for gender and tenure overall or by size of library. Salary.-The mean salary was $20,200, the median $18,900 (table 6). Twenty-five percent of all salaries were under $15,000. Size I libraries again showed significantly lower salaries (F = 14.1, P < .0 1). In addi- tion, differences were found in salary of the turnovers by gender for all libraries combined and for Size 1 libraries (t = 2.96, P = .04; t = 2.73, P < .01 1, respectively). It should be further noted that among all sizes of library, the values for the male salaries were higher. The lack of a statistically significant finding especially among Size 2 libraries may be the result of the small sample of males (N = 9). Analysis of Turnover Rates Analysis of rates without considering gender.-Analysis of the mean turn- over rates for all libraries combined and by size of library support earlier findings by Rubin and Neal that the turnover rates of professional librarians are low compared to other industrial and occupational catego-

Table 7 summarizes the mean annual turnover rates overall and by size of library. The low turnover rates are found for all size categories, and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no significant differences in the mean turnover rates by size of library (F = 1.33, P < .27). Low sample size for Size 2 (N = 6) and Size 3 libraries (N = 7), however, increases the possibility of Type I error and the results should be viewed as suggestive rather than conclusive. Analysis of gender and turnover rates. -All libraries had at least one male professional librarian, so that male turnover rates could be calculated for each library. However, because of the relatively low number of males in the sample (N = 69), gender differences in turnover rates are reported only for all libraries combined, and for Size 3 libraries where the number of males per library was sufficiently large (31 males for 7 libraries). Examination of the mean male and female turnover rates indicates that turnover is low among both sexes (table 8). In order to detect statistically significant gender differences, the mean turnover rates for males and females were subjected to a t-test for independent samples. Table 8 reveals that the difference in the mean turnover rates for males and females is not statistically significant for all libraries combined or for Size 3 libraries. Analysis of Reasons for Leaving and Destination after Quitting Data on reasons for leaving were provided for 414 (98 percent) of the turnovers. For each turnover, six possible categories were provided to

These categories were (1) relocation with spouse, (2) family reasons, (3) further education, (4) retirement, (5) take another position, and (6) other (including "unknown"). A retirement was only recorded if it was voluntary, not mandatory. The data revealed that taking another position and retirement were the chief reasons for leaving (34 percent each). A smaller proportion indicated leaving for family reasons, including relocation with spouse (18 percent), and a small fraction (3 percent) left to get further education. The large per- centage of nonmandatory retirements suggests a mature library work force and changing library conditions, which may be hostile to older librarians. The data on gender and reasons for leaving were subjected to chi- square analysis. When significant associations were found at the .05 level or less, Cramer's V was used as a test of the strength of association. Because of small cell sizes, especially for males in the family-oriented categories, cells related to personal reasons for quitting were collapsed. The analysis revealed that females were considerably more likely than males to leave for family reasons, and considerably less likely than males to leave to take another position (table 9). The greater likelihood of females to leave for family or personal reasons implies that there is a greater propensity toward inter-labor force mobility for females. This is confirmed when the destination of the '.turnovers is examined (table 10). Five possible responses could be re- corded for the destination of a turnover following resignation: (1) found another public library position, (2) found a nonpublic library position,

(3) entered another occupation, (4) left the work force, or (5) destination unknown. Apart from the "unknown" category, the first three responses measure intra-labor force mobility, the fourth, inter-labor force mobil- ity. Destinations were recorded for 409 respondents (97 percent), 64 (15 percent) of which were recorded as unknown. Consequently, the desti- nation was known for 345 (82 percent). The distribution of turnovers by gender and destination was subjected to chi-square tests. The categories for intra-labor force mobility were collapsed and compared to the frequency of turnovers who left the work force. The results indicated statistically significant differences by gender (X2 = 14.15, P < .001, Cramer's V = .26), females being more likely to leave the work force. Of particular interest was whether the difference in intra- and inter- labor force mobility would persist if retirees were eliminated from the sample. When retirees are removed, a clear association between gender and movement out of the work force for females is observed. Although the low cell size for males may affect the chi-square value, the fact that only two percent of the males reported leaving the work force compared to 29 percent of the females is clear evidence that gender differences persist. It should be noted, however, that although significant gender differ- ences were found, the strength of the associations were weak to moder- ate (Cramer's V approximately .20). An attempt was therefore made to identify other variables that are associated with specific reasons for leaving. To explore this, two statistical procedures, stepwise discriminant anal- ysis and canonical discriminant analysis, with fewer groups were em- ployed to identify the best linear combinations of variables that could distinguish among the various reasons for leaving [19]. The analysis focused on nonretiring employees because it is assumed that their turn- over could more likely be controlled than those selecting retirement. Identifying variables with discriminating power.-The stepwise method is used to identify a subset of independent variables that could provide the

Selection of variables is based on the selection criterion established by the researcher. For the purpose of this study, the selection criterion of .05 was used. The method begins by selecting the independent variable that possesses the greatest power to discriminate between the reasons for leaving. In each subsequent step, the variable with the next greatest discriminatory power is entered until all the independent variables that fall within the selection criterion have been entered. In this case, the stepwise procedure selected from five variables: age, tenure, marital status, gender, and possession of a mas- ter's degree. Four variables met the selection criterion as having discrim- inatory power. They are by order of their strength: age, tenure, marital status, and gender (P < .001 for all variables). Although four variables were identified as having discriminatory power, age and tenure are highly intercorrelated. Such an intercorrelation could produce distor- tions in the analysis. Therefore, tenure was removed, and the subse- quent analysis included only three independent variables: age, gender, and marital status. Identifying the canonical variables. -Once the variables with discriminatory power were identified, canonical discriminant analysis was used. Canon- ical discriminant analysis produces linear combinations of independent variables ("canonical variables") that can discriminate between the groups in the dependent variable, in this case, the various reasons for leaving. The linear combination of independent variables with the high- est multiple correlation with the groups in the dependent variable is derived first and is called the "first canonical variable." The canonical variable with the next highest multiple correlation is then derived and is called the "second canonical variable." The process continues until the number of canonical variables is equal to the number of original vari- ables or until the number of canonical variables is equal to N - 1 the

Not all of the canonical variables so derived are statistically significant or contribute substantially to the discrimination of the groups in the dependent variable. It was determined that if a canonical variable's level of significance was greater than .05, or if the canonical variable contributed less than 10 percent to the total discriminatory power of all the canonical variables, then the canonical variable would not be subjected to further analysis. The power of a canonical variable is measured by Wilk's lambda [19, p. 442]. The values of Wilk's lambda range from 0-1; the lower the value, the greater the power. Analysis of reasons for leaving, excluding retirees. -When retirees were ex- cluded, the first canonical variable derived was statistically significant (P < .001) and accounted for 98 percent of the variance. No other canon- ical variables were statistically significant. An examination of the stan- dardized canonical coefficients, which reveals the relative importance that each independent variable plays within the canonical variable, re- vealed that marital status and gender played the strongest roles in discriminating between reasons for leaving unrelated to retirement (Marital Status = .91, Gender = -.69, Age = .05). The standardized values of the coefficients suggest that the model that best discriminates reasons for leaving is that of a single male. The discriminatory power of the canonical variable was moderate (Wilk's = .80). The group means for each reason for leaving were then examined to determine specifically which reasons were being discriminated by the combination of marital status and gender. The group means represent the most typical location of each reason in the space defined by the canonical variable [20, p. 32]. An examination of the group means (table 11) suggests that marital status and gender discriminate personal and family reasons from leaving to take another position and that unmarried males are more likely to leave to take other positions, and married females are more likely to leave for family or personal reasons.

Single females, for example, may be just as likely as males to take another position. For this reason, separate canonical discriminant analyses were performed on married and unmarried turn- overs. The independent variables were age and gender. Married turnovers: Among married turnovers, one statistically signifi- cant canonical variable was derived. The power of the variable was moderate (Wilk's = .85). Examination of the standardized canonical coefficients revealed that gender played the major role (Gender = 1.07, Age = -.10). Examination of the group means for the reasons for leaving (table 12) confirmed that gender differences among married turnovers serve to discriminate between family related reasons for leav- ing and leaving to take another position; females were more likely to leave for family reasons. Unmarried turnover: When unmarried turnovers were studied, two canonical variables were derived, but neither was statistically significant (P < .55, P < .58). This suggests that reasons for leaving are not discrim- inable among the unmarried turnovers. IV. Discussion and Implications of the Findings Low Turnover Rates The findings of this study raise many issues especially in regard to the size of the employee turnover rate and the nature of the turnover for males and females. The data reveal that the turnover rate for librarians in libraries serving populations of at least one-hundred thousand or more is approximately 7 percent. This is lower than other business and occupational categories, including occupations in which females domi- nate numerically. Price, for example, reports that turnover rates for primary and secondary school teachers fall between 11 percent and 17 percent; for social caseworkers, 30-34 percent, and for nurses 42-67 percent [2, pp. 50-54]. The low rate is also supported by earlier studies

The low turnover rate is especially notable because of the numerical dominance of females in the profession. Given their low pay and the fact that they occupy a disproportionate number of lower level positions, one would suspect greater turnover. Despite these facts, however, the female turnover rate is not only low, but it is also not statistically different from the male rate. What plausible factors could contribute to this apparent stability in the professional librarian work force as a whole and for females in particu- lar? Late career choice. -One possible explanation for the low turnover rate is that the choice of a library career comes relatively late. Simpson and Simpson note that librarianship has "an especially high proportion of late deciders" [21, p. 202], many of whom had other careers before librarianship. It may be that increased maturity and work experience create stability among librarians. Research on the general labor force indicates that a large proportion of American workers spend their mature working years with the same employer [22, p. 18]. The presence of family responsibilities.-Although competition with family responsibilities is recognized as a complicating factor for females in the workplace [23, p. 47], this factor may be a source of stability as well as instability. Braunagel, in her study of academic librarians, found that 47 percent of the female librarians who expressed no intention of leaving their geographic area gave the presence of their spouse or family as the reason for their wish to remain [16, p. 113]. Federico et al., in their analysis of the general labor market, argued that women with family responsibilities actually had lower turnover rates [24, p. 565]. The need for income either to support oneself or family.-Dickson, in her study of librarians returning to the library work force, found that 64
EMPLOYEE TURNOVER 43 percent (N = 165) identified economic reasons for their return [17, p. 8]. The idea that the female's income is discretionary even in the two- income family is obsolete. Barrett reports that 24.9 million females, 68 percent of the female work force, work out of economic necessity [25, p. 59]. The need to remain on the job for most females is not a matter of discretion and provides strong motivation for remaining on the job, despite lower pay and position. Lack or perceived lack of opportunity for job movement. -The lack of opportu- nity for movement has been identified by Price as an important variable in turnover behavior [2, pp. 81-84]. Braunagel noted that although male and female mobility were the same, females perceived that they were less mobile than their male counterparts [16, p. 116]. Heim and Esta- brook reported that twice more women than men felt that they had limited mobility [15, p. 23]. This perceived lack of opportunity for employment may diminish female turnover rates. High levels of satisfaction with the type of work.-The present study does not examine job satisfaction as a variable, although it is recognized as an intervening variable in turnover decisions. High levels of job satisfaction are negatively associated with turnover behavior [2, pp. 79-81]. It is reasonable to speculate that the low turnover rates among librarians reflect higher levels of satisfaction in librarianship than in other occupa- tions. What factors in library work could produce satisfaction among the library work force? D'Elia reported in a study of 228 librarians that two variables were key aspects of satisfaction for librarians: Supervision- Human Relations and Ability Utilization [26, p. 300]. These variables include the competence and interpersonal skills of the supervisor, the way in which policies are carried out, and the opportunity to have responsibility, to be creative and autonomous, and to achieve and be recognized [26, p. 300]. It is possible that libraries meet these needs to a greater degree than do other professions, or that the library work force is more easily satisfied than workers in other occupations. Only job satisfaction studies across occupations could provide an answer. Similarly, it may also be that librarianship provides the predominahtly female work force with an environment that simultaneously offers both professional fulfillment and sex-role congruence. This explanation fits a "sex-role" model described by Nieva and Gutek in which women select female professions because they can perform sex-appropriate roles in them [23, p. 117]. In librarianship, the female librarian can fulfill the traditional female roles of service, helping, and teaching and, at the same time, strive for the basic professional needs of achievement and recognition. It must be emphasized however that at present there is no research that supports this explanation.
44 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY Differences in Reasons for Leaving Although males and females were found to leave their jobs at the same rates, the data reveal that females were much more likely than males to leave the work force, often for family reasons; males were more likely to remain in the work force to take other positions. But the discriminant analysis did not support this pattern for unmarried females, only for married females. Approximately 20 percent of the females in the present study left for family-related reasons. This pattern is consistent with other library data and with data from the general labor market. Heim and Estabrook found that 29 percent of the female librarians surveyed had left their last positions for child-care purposes [15, p. 28]. Braunagel found that 25 percent of the female academic librarians left for family-related reasons [16, p. 140]. Agassi, in a study of 761 females in the general labor market, found that 20 percent left their last job for family reasons [27, p. 59]. However, it must also be emphasized that over half the nonretiring females who resigned left to take other jobs. Braunagel re- ported that in 75 percent of the cases in which a female academic librarian left her job, she moved to take another position [16, p. 141]. Added to this must be the recognition that the gender differences in reasons for leaving may be exaggerated. Males may find it less acceptable to admit to an employer that they left for family- rather than career- related reasons. Although there is no direct evidence from research in librarianship, concern over sex discrimination includes a fear that library adminis- trators may be less confident in the hiring of women because of their suspicion that family obligations could reduce the job commitment of females and increase their turnover. This fear is reflected in the general labor market, where current Equal Employment Opportunity guidelines for sex discrimination explicitly identify the belief that females have higher turnover as a discriminatory belief [28]. The present data does not support such a belief. Although females are more likely to leave their jobs for family reasons, these reasons substitute for rather than add to reasons for quitting. The rate of leaving for males and females is not significantly different. Some Final Observations The low turnover rates for public librarians highlight the importance of making good hiring decisions. Each turnover becomes a comparatively rare opportunity to introduce productive employees into the system. Similarly, it emphasizes the need to train, motivate, and encourage the many librarians likely to remain on staff. The large number of turnovers who are voluntary retirees suggests that library organizations must pro- vide for a work force that matures within its organizational boundaries.
EMPLOYEE TURNOVER 45 It is unknown how many of these voluntary retirees might have been productively retained so that the institution could continue to benefit from their knowledge and experience. Understanding the causes of turnover in librarianship requires more study. Of particular interest should be an investigation into the relation- ship of work performance and turnover behavior. Given the relatively low turnover rate, it is critical that libraries know whether their strong performers are more likely to leave and, if so, to determine the organiza- tional causes. Similarly, it is important to know if poor performers are likely to stay and to identify what aspect of the organization might be encouraging unproductive employees to remain. REFERENCES 1.
