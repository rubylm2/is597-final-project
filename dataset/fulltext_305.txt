THE LI BRARY QUARTERLY Volume XXXIII JULY 1963 Number 3 VOTING ON A LIBRARY BOND ISSUE: TWO ELECTIONS IN AKRON, OHIO, 1961 AND 19621 GUY GARRISON AT THE November 7, 1961, general election, the voters of Akron, Ohio, rejected a proposed $3,- 000,000 bond issue for a new central public library building. At the May 8 primary election the following year they approved, by a narrow margin, an iden- tical proposal. This paper attempts to analyze the voting patterns in these two elections in an effort to discover ways in which voting on the two referendums can be correlated with socioeconomic data about the city, and further to sug- gest ways in which similar analyses might be helpful in other cities as an aid in planning a bond-issue campaign. A bond-issue referendum is a pecul- iarly isolated phenomenon because it puts a policy decision squarely on the individual voter. Most other decisions affecting libraries are made administra- tively or legislatively and are open to all kinds of modification and compro- mise as they develop. Once a bond issue is on the ballot it remains constant and is either approved or disapproved in ac- cordance with the action the electorate takes on the proposal. A bond-issue election provides a possibility for a di- rect check by the people of the actions of library boards, one of the few ways they have of doing so. Yet, it appears that the electorate, at least in larger cities, rarely uses that check in a de- cisive fashion. Library bond issues ordi- narily either win or lose by a close mar- gin and, if they fail, are the victims more of apathy than opposition. There is already in existence a con- siderable amount of recorded experi- ence that can aid a library in planning, developing, and executing a campaign. Most of this is of a reportorial nature and does not permit much generaliza- tion. The emphasis is almost always on the techniques used in promoting the bond issue. What is missing is any theo- retical framework within which it is possible to compare campaigns and election results so as to find basic de- terminants of success and failure which could guide referendum sponsors to a better understanding of how to direct campaign efforts. Some research on library referen- dums has been done, but too little data 1 The research reported here was supported by a grant from the Illinois State Library. 229
230 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY have been collected and recorded to per- mit many definite statements, let alone hypotheses, about such elections. We are unable even to make a general statement that, nationwide, the voters have taken a positive or negative atti- tude toward library issues in recent years or that they have approved bond issues while disapproving increased tax levies. The dearth of systematically re- corded information about library elec- tions makes it impossible to compare them either by section of the country, size of city, or type of election.2 The study presented here is an ex- ploratory one which tries to show (1) what kinds of areas in a city were most favorable to a library bond issue and (2) how a library can use readily avail- able figures to find out where these areas are. It asks questions and sug- gests areas for investigation rather than setting up distinct hypotheses for proof. DESCRIPTION OF AKRON, OHIO Akron, Ohio, a city of nearly 300,000, is best known as the center of the rub- ber industry. It early became a center for rubber manufacturing even before the automotive industry fostered the tremendous demand for automobile tires that led to the rapid growth of rubber factories. The city tripled in population between 1910 and 1920 and became a one-industry boom town. It was very hard hit by the depression and labor strife during the 1930's, experi- enced another period of rapid industrial growth during World War II, and is to- day a relatively prosperous, clean, and economically stable city. It is the heart of a metropolitan area of over 500,000 people and one of the chief industrial centers of the emerging megalopolis ex- tending from Pittsburgh across north- ern Ohio to Detroit. Physically, the city is not congested or slum-ridden, having experienced most of its growth in a period when the automobile and other motorized transportation allowed cities to spread out. Small single-family dwellings form the typical housing pattern, and the proportion of owner-occupied homes is very high. As the suburban trend con- tinues, the city faces an incipient prob- lem of a declining central business dis- trict and large residential gray areas that were built too quickly and too cheaply forty years ago and are likely to decline into near-slums. The city is dominated by industry and has a large proportion of skilled and semiskilled workers drawing rela- tively high wages. It has always de- pended for a labor supply less on for- eign immigration than on large numbers of workers coming up from the rural South, especially from West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama. In many ways these residents with a homo- geneous, white southern background set the tone of urban life. They tend to re- tain roots in their home states, to return frequently, and to have little stake in the future of the city.' This lack of concern for the city as a whole is not limited to recent migrants but can fairly be called widespread. The deterioration of the downtown area as a shopping, commercial, and enter- tainment center is advancing, as evi- denced by numerous empty stores, of- 2 The Library Services Branch, U.S. Office of Education, has announced plans for a systematic collection of library election and bond-issue infor- mation beginning with July, 1962, data.

VOTING ON A LIBRARY BOND ISSUE 231 fices, and theaters and a total lack of new construction. The argument that a new main library must be in the heart of the downtown area was not likely to carry much weight with residents who have virtually learned to do without a central business district. Even the li- brarian spoke of a "generally anti- downtown feeling" as one factor in the defeat of the first referendum.4 THE LIBRARY ELECTIONS The bond-issue referendum on the ballot November 7, 1961, was the first time Akronites had ever been asked to support a bond issue for a main library building. In 1950, an effort had been made to pass a bond issue for construc- tion of five new branches.5 Ohio law at that time required a 55 per cent favor- able vote on such referendums; and the issue, though approved by a majority of voters, failed to pass. Again in 1951 the issue was submitted to vote and again won a majority but failed to reach 55 per cent in favor. During this time, the library was able to accumulate enough money from the operating budg- et to build one new branch. This suc- cessful undertaking, and the evident interest in the library shown by the majority of votes, led to additional ap- propriations from the County Budget Committee in subsequent years, and by 1958 the library had constructed seven new branch buildings-none of which had been the result of a bond issue. In spite of the good coverage through branch libraries, the city still had a ma- jor problem in its poorly located main library, a remodeled newspaper plant into which the library had moved in 1938 from its Carnegie building a few blocks closer to Main Street. Fast grow- ing circulation and increased reference use, together with inadequate space and an inconvenient location, made a new central building desirable. In the words of a campaign brochure, "the main li- brary is the hub, supporting branches, sub-branches, stations, and bookmo- biles, which are the spokes, supporting the educational life of the entire com- munity, which is the rim. Without a strong hub, the entire wheel collapses."6 The Akron Public Library, though by Ohio library law serving the whole county, is governed by a board of trus- tees appointed by the Board of Educa- tion of the Akron City School District. The issue at stake in the November, 1961, referendum was whether the Board of Education should issue bonds in the amount of $3,000,000 for the purpose of erecting a new building for the Akron Public Library. The final count showed 37,855 votes in favor, 41,464 opposed-or only 47.7 per cent of those voting in favor of the bond issue. After this initial failure, the Akron Board of Education voted to place an identical $3,000,000 bond issue on the primary-election ballot the following spring. In the election held on May 8, 1962, the bond issue was approved by a 52.7 per cent favorable vote. The failure of the bond issue to pass in the first election was no doubt suffi- cient cause to raise some doubts about the strategy of the campaign. At any rate, the second campaign, building on the momentum of the first, was more ' R. Russell Munn, Aniinual Report of the Akron Public Library, 1961 (Akron, Ohio: Akron Public Library, 1962).

232 THlE LIBRARY QUARTERLY highly organized, made greater use of volunteer workers, and adopted a grass- roots approach to getting out the vote. The methods used by the sponsors in the two campaigns have been reported by the librarian in another article and are not the chief matter of concern here.7 From all evidence, the library did a thorough job of selling, especially in the second election where much more use was made of persons outside the in- stitution to carry the message. After the first election, the librarian studied ward and precinct voting tabu- lations and precinct maps in an effort to uncover some leads that might ex- plain the defeat and help prepare for the next attempt.8 Ward boundaries, in Akron as elsewhere, do not always cor- respond to real neighborhood or com- munity limits. Nevertheless, it is help- ful to examine the vote by wards be- cause these sections of the city are relatively homogeneous and can be fair- ly well identified with neighborhoods of known social makeup. In 1961, the four wards most favor- able to the bond issue were 1, 3, 4, and 8. The same was true in 1962 when the same wards were again most favorable. The over-all gain city-wide was 4.8 per cent. The gain for these four wards was about the same, 4.9 per cent. The nar- row margin of victory in the second election did not come about because of radical changes in certain wards, but by a slight over-all increase throughout the city. A close study of the ward and pre- cinct vote in the first election would have shown very clearly what to expect in the second election. Inspection of ward and precinct figures shows a very high degree of correlation between the way precincts voted in the two elec- tions. This much information, derived from official voting records, is easily availa- ble in most situations where library is- sues are on the ballot. An analysis of this kind of data, with subsequent gen- eralizations, represents the usual limit of inquiry into library elections. A li- brarian is able to say that certain wards are strongly in favor, that neighbor- hoods with certain basic characteristics are for or against, that a second elec- tion, closely following a first, is very likely to produce a consistent voting pattern. To measure these relationships more precisely, one must move to an- other level of abstraction and attempt to correlate the vote with measures of the socioeconomic characteristics of the city. ANALYSIS OF VOTING BY CENSUS TRACTS Thus far the discussion of the Akron library elections has been in terms of groups of voters (wards and precincts) rather than in terms of individual vot- ing behavior. To do the latter would have required extensive on-the-spot in- terviewing at the time of the election. However, quantitative data do exist, in the form of census-tract statistics, that provide a great amount of socioeco- nomic information about small areas of the city. Through the comparison of census-tract data and precinct voting figures it is possible to make correla- tions between voting behavior and cer- tain socioeconomic characteristics. This information is still in terms of groups of voters (census-tract populations) 'Munn, "On Losing and Winning a Bond Issue," Library Journal, LXXXVII (December 1, 1962), 4323-26. 8 Precinct maps were supplied by the Summit County, Ohio, Board of Elections. The Akron Pub- lic Library prepared complete tables of ward and precinct vote on both elections from information supplied by the Board of Elections.
VOTING ON A LIBRARY BOND ISSUE 233 but it is suitable for statistical handling. The goal of such analysis is to dis- cover socioeconomic factors correlated with support and opposition to the li- brary referendums. Since this is an eco- logical correlation analysis, however, there are certain limitations to keep in mind. First, what is measured is the as- sociation between variables and not cause and effect. The associations noted may be accidental or may be due in large part to the action of other un- known factors. Second, the correlations are between properties of groups of people and not of individuals. The unit is the census-tract population and not the individual voter. The Census Bureau has divided the city of Akron into fifty-eight census tracts.9 Figure 1 shows the boundaries of these tracts and the symbols used. In the correlation analysis that follows, tract A-3A, the heart of the central business district, is eliminated from the figures because it contains a small and very atypical population. In order to relate the voting behavior data, which are available by precinct, to the socioeconomic data available by census tract, it is necessary to assign each precinct to the census tract into which it falls. This is done by use of census-tract maps and large-scale pre- cinct maps. Most of the 435 precincts in Akron fall neatly within a single census tract, but it was necessary to make an allocation of the vote when a precinct extended into two census tracts. This was done with about 10 per cent of the precincts. After this has been done, it is possi- ble to derive for each census tract a fig- ure representing the following measure of voting behavior:'10 1. Percentage of favorable vote in 1961 on the library issue 2. Percentage of favorable vote in 1962 on the library issue 3. Percentage of adults who are registered voters 4. Percentage of registered voters who voted in 1961 election 5. Percentage of registered voters who voted in 1962 election These figures make up the dependent variables in the correlation analysis. Table 1 shows the scores by census tract on variables 1 and 2. The independent variables used in the analysis are taken from the 1960 census-tract data for Akron. Of the var- ious socioeconomic characteristics that might have been used, previous research indicated that the following measures might be usefully compared with voting figures:"11 1. Percentage of the census-tract population of foreign birth or foreign parentage 2. Percentage of adults with elementary- school education only 3. Percentage of adults with one or more years of college 9 U.S. Bureau of the Census, U.S. Censuses of Population and Housing: 1960, Census Tracts (Final Report PHC (1) 2 [Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1962]). 10 In addition to precinct maps and voting data cited above, the following sources were useful: tables of ward and precinct voting on recent local issues, compiled by the Bureau of Research, Akron Chamber of Commerce, June, 1962; ward and pre- cinct summaries of registered voters as of March 28, 1962, issued by the Summit County Board of Elections; map of Summit County by census tracts issued by the Akron City Planning Commission, September, 1960. "This interpretation derives mostly from Guy Garrison, "Voting Behavior on Public Library Bond Issues: An Analysis of Three Elections in Seattle, Washington, 1950-56" (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, University of Illinois, 1960).

Since this is an exploratory study, and since the scores are at best only area averages for the factors measured, the statistical analysis has not been car- ried beyond simple product-moment correlation. We are describing the asso- ciation of variables in two elections and not trying to generalize to a larger sam- ple and to other cities. However, one step beyond the first correlation analysis was considered de- sirable. Preliminary inspection of the plotted data shows that the relationship of variables is seldom linear. The tracts that contribute to the non-linearity are so consistent and so homogeneous that two sets of correlation coefficients were obtained, the first set with all fifty- seven tracts, and the second with forty- nine tracts, eliminating the eight tracts that, by inspection of the scatter dia- grams, seem to be acting almost inde- pendently (see Table 1). The tracts thus removed are central- city neighborhoods, predominantly Ne- gro, low income, low in educational level, low on all variables measuring housing, but high on percentage of fa- vorable vote on the library bond issues.

236 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY The elimination of these tracts results, in almost all cases, in a much higher de- gree of correlation between voting and the socioeconomic variables. These tracts provide exceptions for the gen- eral observations drawn from the plot- ted data that a lower percentage of fa- vorable vote is associated with low ed- ucational level, low income, and a high proportion of industrial workers. Infer- eign-born or of foreign parentage is not a good indicator of voting behavior. Only in the 1962 election and with the Negro tracts removed is there a slight positive correlation between favorable vote and areas that are more foreign. The percentage of Akron population foreign-born or of foreign or mixed par- entage in 1960 was 18.9. Since this fig- ure is comparatively low and since the TABLE 2 INTERCORRELATIONS OF VOTING BEHAVIOR VARIABLES WITH SOCIOECONOMIC VARIABLES FOR 57 CENSUS TRACTS VOTING BEHAVIOR VARIABLES SOCIOECONOMIC VARIABLES Per Cent Per Cent Per Cent Per Cent Adults Voting on Voting on Yes in 1961 Yes in 1962 Registered 1961 Issue 1962 Issue Voters 1.

Tables 2 and 3 show the correlation coefficients between voting behavior variables and socioeconomic variables for the entire sample (N- 57) and with the extreme cases removed (N 49). The association of these variables can now be discussed one at a time. Foreign.-The variable measuring the percentage of tract population for- foreign population is well distributed throughout the city, there is little basis here for any generalization. Negro.-The percentage of non- white population in Akron in 1960 was 13.1, increasing from 8.7 in 1950. This Negro population (only 2 58 being listed as "other races") is concentrated in rather sharply demarcated areas of the city, and these areas were responsible for some of the highest percentages of favorable vote in both elections. Eight tracts are over 60 per cent Negro; an additional nine have over 10 per cent Negro residents. The average vote for
VOTING ON A LIBRARY BOND ISSUE 237 the library in the eight predominantly Negro tracts in 1961 was 60.4; in 1962, 60.0. The only other tracts in the city with such a high percentage of favor- able vote were the few highest in edu- cational, occupational, and income lev- el. In fact, if one ranks the census tracts first by median income and then by proportion of Negro residents and notes the top quarter from each distribution, he will have nearly all the tracts that TABLE 3 INTERCORRELATIONS OF VOTING BEHAVIOR VARIABLES WITH SOCIOECONOMIC VARIABLES FOR 49 CENSUS TRACTS VOTING BEHAVIOR VARIABLES SOCIOECONOMIC VARIABLES Per Cent Per Cent Per Cent Per Cent Per Cent Adults Voting on Voting on Yes in 1961 Yes in 1962 Registered 1961 Is 1962 Is Voters 1.

This is not to say that race or in- come alone is a causal factor in the high vote but merely to indicate that neighborhoods highest on these charac- teristics produced more favorable votes on the library bond issues than did neighborhoods lowest on these charac- teristics. Educational level.-Three variables measure the educational level of the census-tract population. The first makes use of scores representing the median number of school years completed by adults. Using the sample of fifty-seven tracts, the correlation is low. With the limited sample there is a positive cor- relation (r - +.417 in 1961, +.593 in 1962) showing that, except for the cen- tral-city low-income Negro tracts, a higher level of education is associated with a higher percentage of favorable vote. The second education variable meas- ures the percentage of adult residents with eight years or less of schooling. There is a negative correlation with rate of favorable voting that increases when the eight extreme cases are dropped (r-_-.334 in 1961, -.453 in 1962). With the exception of these eight tracts, an increasingly unfavora- ble vote is seen as the percentage of adults with only elementary-school edu- cation increases. There is a positive correlation be- tween favorable vote and the third edu- cation variable, which measures the percentage of adults with one or more years of college (r +.384 in 1961, +.581 in 1962). The relationship is not
238 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY linear, and with the eight tracts re- moved it increases considerably (r +.736 in 1961, +.824 in 1962). This variable is one of the best indicators of areas that voted favorably on the li- brary issue. In addition, tracts that are high in educational level tend to have a higher percentage of registered voters and a higher turnout of voters voting on the library issue at both general and pri- mary elections than do the tracts with lower educational levels. Tracts higher in number of college-trained adults, for instance, have more adults registered (r - +.619), and a better turnout of voters (r - +.696 in 1962). This rela- tionship holds constant with both the full sample and the delimited sample. Median income.-The plotted data on median income and percentage of favorable vote show a curve with both low- and high-income tracts voting for the bond issue and middle-income areas voting against. In general, no middle- income tract was especially favorable and a number had only a 30-40 per cent favorable vote. With the eight Ne- gro tracts removed, the correlation be- comes moderately positive (r_ +.427 in 1961, +.604 in 1962), indicating that, with the exception of the eight tracts, a higher "yes" vote was associ- ated with higher median income. Housing status.-Three variables are used to measure the correlation be- tween voting on the library issue and aspects of the housing in the tract area. The variable measuring the percentage of homes that are owner-occupied shows little relationship with the vote. There is some tendency for areas highest in home ownership to be more negative in their voting, except for the few highest- income areas. There is no strong correlation be- tween favorable vote and the percent- age of deteriorated housing in the area, but when all fifty-seven tracts are in- cluded in the sample there is a tendency (r -+.379 in 1962) for a more favor- able vote to come from tracts with more deteriorated housing. This is accounted for by the favorable vote in the central- city, low-income areas. With these eight tracts removed, the correlation becomes low and negative (r -.196). With the variable measuring median value of owner-occupied homes, the correlation is positive but not linear. High-value areas are favorable, but among low-value areas the vote is split and the Negro areas (whether high or low in ownership) tend to be favorable, while all other low-value areas are neg- ative. Occupational status.-The two varia- bles measuring occupational status in the census tracts are among those that show a high degree of association with percentage of favorable vote on the li- brary elections. The correlation be- tween favorable vote and per cent of professional, technical, and managerial workers in the tract is positive in both elections and with both samples. In the 1962 election r - +.542 with the en- tire sample and +.808 with the limited sample. A knowledge of which areas contain the highest proportion of pro- fessional, technical, and managerial workers would not only indicate poten- tially favorable areas but would also show areas where many adults are reg- istered voters (r - +.652) and are likely to turn out for elections (r +.695 in 1962). The correlation between number of industrial workers (those classed as craftsmen, operatives, and laborers by the census) and the degree of favorable vote is negative. Areas high in number
VOTING ON A LIBRARY BOND ISSUE 239 of industrial workers tend to be low in favorable vote. In some ways this is the most consistent and useful measure, be- cause the degree of association is strong with both sample sizes. With the larger sample r -.442 in 1961 and -.628 in 1962. With the delimited sample the association is higher (r - .706 in 1961, -.790 in 1962). The plotted data in this case are less curvilinear than with other variables but still show that the eight central-city, Negro tracts are more favorable to the library issues than other areas with an equally high number of industrial workers, but which are white, farther removed from the central part of town, and higher on the housing measures. There is a negative correlation be- tween the percentage of industrial workers and the other voting variables as well. The tracts with more industrial workers have a smaller percentage of registered voters (r- -.567) and a lower percentage of registered voters who turn out on election day (r -.687 in 1962). DISCUSSION Whether or not the patterns of vot- ing observed in the Akron elections are applicable to other library elections in other cities can only be determined by additional data collection and analysis. Any valid discussion of the problems of library bond-issue campaigns awaits further studies of individual experi- ences and a much better and more com- plete recording of the basic facts about such elections. The results of these Akron elections, however, resemble so closely the re- sults in three library elections in Seat- tle, Washington, which were the subject of a previous study,'2 that it seems rea- sonable, on the basis of the five exam- ples, to make a few observations and to pose some questions that might be de- veloped as hypotheses in further study of library elections. 1. A librarian who examines census- tract data for the city and identifies areas that are high in percentage of adults with college training and high in percentage of professional, technical, and managerial workers can identify areas that are most likely to vote "yes" on a library bond issue. If he goes fur- ther and identifies areas that are cen- tral, low income, and predominantly Negro he can identify other potentially favorable areas. 2. A librarian who analyzes the cen- sus-tract data to the point where he can identify areas that are middle income, low in number of college-trained per- sons, and high in number of industrial workers can locate areas where the turnout will be low and the vote nega- tive. 3. The pattern of voting will change little between two elections held within a reasonably short period of time. The experience of the first can provide clear indications of favorable and unfavora- ble areas in the second. (For the two elections studied here, r +.910.) 4. Can the vote be explained largely in terms of economic determinism or is it better explained as a reflection of so- cial status and social awareness? The high vote in areas of high income and high educational level seems to show that, regardless of taxes, the areas of the city that are regarded as better res- idential neighborhoods are more likely to vote for the library than against it. 5. Does the high percentage of fa- vorable vote from these areas result from the greater use made of the li- brary here or from the fact that these 12 Garrison, op. cit., pp. 146-51.
240 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY areas contain the people who have city- wide interests, who identify with educa- tional and cultural activities, and who are not as much concerned with high taxes as with higher levels of govern- mental services in general?'3 6. How can one explain the fact that middle-class areas are the least likely to vote for the library? This opposition can be explained partly in economic terms but may reflect as much the al- ienation of the public library from the everyday interests of the ordinary citi- zens who fill these middle-income, work- ing-class neighborhoods and who have little interest in governmental services beyond the necessary and basic ones such as schools, streets, and fire and police protection. 7. Bond issues are usually retired from property taxes and do not directly burden the taxpayer who owns no real property. To what extent does this ex- plain the higher vote in central-city areas and in low-income areas where a smaller number of voters are property owners? 8. The coincidence of high favorable vote and a predominance of Negro resi- dents in the Seattle and Akron elections needs clarification. Both studies report on areas rather than on individuals. Is it also true that the Negro as an indi- vidual voter is more apt to vote for the library or is the high area vote a reflec- tion of other factors? 9. In a city the size of Akron, the library campaign, no matter how effec- tive, is not likely to reach a large pro- portion of the voters. Many, on elec- tion day, will never have heard the is- sue discussed or have read about it in the newspapers. A large part of the vote is not determined by the activities of sponsors or opposition, but by existing attitudes toward the library and toward the city in general. If this attitude is negative, or unformed, one can hardly expect the voter to vote "yes" and vol- untarily increase his taxes.'4 10. A successful campaign reaches those people whose pre-existing atti- tudes are good and convinces them that the library bond issue is important and necessary. A campaign is not likely to change attitudes or create attitudes. For these reasons, would sponsors of library bond issues be wise to concen- trate on kinds of people, and areas of the city, most likely to have good exist- ing attitudes toward the library? 11. There is evidence that increased turnout can usually be associated with defeated bond issues. Increased turnout may be potentially dangerous unless the campaign is waged in such a way that the increased vote comes from areas known to be favorably disposed.'5 12.

If it is known that certain seg- ments of the population, and certain areas of the city, will be unfavorable, is the library obligated nevertheless to try to present the facts of the matter in as great detail here as in areas that are likely to be favorable? 16 Lipset, op. cit.
