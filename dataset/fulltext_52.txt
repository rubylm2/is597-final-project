THE POLITICS OF STANDARD SELECTION GUIDES: THE CASE OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY CATALOG Juris Dilevko' and Lisa Gottlieb2 Using the Public Library Catalog (PLC) as an example, we show how a well- respected collection development tool contains ideological frames. Graduate students at a library science program at a North American university were asked, as part of a class assignment, to evaluate PLC recommendations for subject areas in which they had background knowledge. The PLC often makes recommendations that have an imbalance of perspectives (for exam- ple, missing theoretical perspectives, overemphasis of a particular facet or theory within a field, missing voices), lack authority, do not have a close match between recommended title and topic area, do not provide a compre- hensive framework for the subject area, and are problematic in terms of their usability (for example, lack of balance between scholarly and popular titles, datedness, and format). Introduction The identity of any profession stems from an ideological or cognitive base that both explicates the social role of its members and confers upon these individuals a particular status [1]. Michael Harris identifies the cognitive base of librarianship as the "conviction that librarians are able, based on their special knowledge, to distinguish the enduring from the ephemeral, the valuable from the worthless, the good from the bad; and that the librarian has the right to prescribe for readers via the process of selection" [1, p. 234]. In other words, a traditional tenet of librarianship that shapes both the ideological and practical aspects of this profession is that, when librarians select "good books," 1.

290 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY their decisions are the result of their acquired training, with minimal influence from other external sources. Harris debunks the ingenu- ousness of this notion by pointing out that libraries are just one of a number of "institutional filters" through which "cultural productions must pass . .. prior to reaching a 'public'" [1, p. 235]. These filters, arranged according to a hierarchical power scale, begin with the cre- ators (writers), followed by the producers (publishers), reviewers (pub- lished book reviewers, university professors), the institutional con- sumer (identified specifically as bookstores, libraries, and educational institutions), and, finally, the reader. While the placement of libraries on the penultimate rung demonstrates the role of the library as a con- duit between, on the one hand, the creators and producers of books and, on the other hand, the reading public, it also indicates the process through which librarians themselves have their information filtered. This filtering process is especially evident in the relationship between collection development and canon formation-"the process whereby authors become recognized or valued as standard" [2, p. 515]. Harris describes the confluence of the collection development and canon for- mation processes in terms of the "frames ... endorsed by the creators and producers of high culture" that librarians use to select materials [1, p. 243]. These frames consist of tools such as review media, book lists, and university reading lists that both reflect and perpetuate the canonical status quo created by the institutional filters positioned above the library (that is, the publishers and reviewers). The use and implication of frames in academic libraries has been documented, for instance, byJohn Doherty, who explains how these institutions are posi- tioned to "imaintain the supremacy of the canon through the tradi- tional definition of the role of the academic library as a support to the academic curriculum" [3, p. 404]. Here, the specific frame used by the librarian is course curricula and syllabi of a particular college or university. By following a collection development policy that is "by ne- cessity determined by the academic priorities of each department and unit that the libraries serve," the academic library reinforces the domi- nant-and many would argue hegemonic-ideology of the academy [3, p. 403], or what Marlene Manoff refers to as "the elite heritage" of the university [4, p. 2]. Mark Cyzyk notes that the same situation arises with the development and evaluation of library collections by subject specialists, explaining that such individuals are "both a product of and a contributor or potential contributor to the established canon" [5, p. 61]. The role of course curricula and subject specialists, in turn, is rein- forced through the use of another type of frame: book lists developed by the library community as collection development and evaluation
THE POLITICS OF STANDARD SELECTION GUIDES 291 tools. The Research Library Group (RLG) Conspectus, for example, presents a checklist against which institutions can evaluate their collec- tions as compared to major North American research libraries. Cyzyk explains that "use of the RLG Conspectus works clearly within the con- fines of what is deemed by users to be of legitimate research interest, and hence, of the items that are at least candidates for canonical status" [5, p. 60]. Similarly, Lynn Connaway notes that another such frame, Booksfor College Libraries (BCL), "proposes to represent a core collection that is designed to support the curriculum of four-year institutions, to be used as a measure to evaluate academic library collections, and to be considered an important canon of the library field" [6, p. 72]. While BCL is identified as a "canon of the library field," the titles included in this tool are "based on the initial selection made for the University of California's New Campuses program" [6, p. 70] -a fact that under- scores the connection between these frames and various institutional filters. While the use and implication of frames is most frequently examined in the context of academic libraries, these issues are equally relevant to the collection development approaches of public libraries. The present study examines the Public Library Catalog (PLC) to show how a standard- ized and respected collection development tool conceals a variety of ideological frames. First published in 1934, the PLC recommends refer- ence and adult nonfiction books for inclusion in the collections of pub- lic libraries, as well as small undergraduate libraries. Prior to 1969, its full title was the Standard Catalogfor Public Libraries, with the word "stan- dard" emphasizing the idea that the materials presented in the catalog were "the best books" available on particular subjects and therefore met certain standards. In fact, the term "standard" applies not only to the perceived value of the books recommended by the PLC but also to the idea that, by following these recommendations, a library's collec- tion as a whole becomes standardized in relation to similar institutions. Helen Haines notes that the PLC follows "two principles" that were first set by the American Library Association Catalog in 1904: "the selec- tion of books by consensus of professional judgement and their evalua- tion in a compact note of characterization" [7, p. 66]. The PLC still follows this format. As editor Juliette Yaakov explains in the introduc- tion to the eleventh edition, published in 1999, book selections were made "by experienced librarians representing pubic library systems across the United States" [8, p. viii]. Based on information provided by the PLC Web page, initial selections were then put to a vote: "Since the voting represents the collective opinion of a number of librarians in each system, the consensus is broad-based" [9, p. 2]. Librarians rep- resenting a total of eighteen library systems contributed to the 1999
292 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY base volume of the PLC, with thirteen and fourteen library systems con- tributing to the 1999 supplement [10] and 2000 annual supplement [11], respectively. In total, nineteen different library systems partici- pated, and these libraries were located in the following cities: Boston, Pittsburgh, Chappaqua, Parma, Denver, Baltimore, Evanston, Hous- ton, Indianapolis, Madison, Minneapolis, Norfolk, Omaha, St. Louis, San Antonio, Seattle, Tulsa, Providence, and Raleigh [8, p. ix; 11, p. v]. The PLC is arranged as a classified catalog, with an author/ title/ subject and analytical index. Individual entries, organized according to the Dewey Decimal Classification, provide a brief "descriptive and critical annotation" of the work [8, p. viii], usually in the form of a quotation from a book review source such as Booklist, Choice, Library Journal, or Publisher's Weekly. Following a brief discussion of the various factors that inform the development of canons or frames, this article presents a case study of the PLC as one example of a collection development frame. Students in a graduate-level collection development course in a library science program at a major North American university were asked, as part of a class assignment, to evaluate the PLCs recommendations for subject areas in which they had background knowledge or expertise. Predomi- nant issues raised in these evaluations are presented and analyzed in terms of their implications for the use of the PLC as a popular collec- tion development tool. Framing the Frames: The Problem with Canons A recurring theme of literary research on canons has been "unmasking the ideological nature of the canon" [1, p. 232]. Brian Quinn identifies the protagonists in this debate as "canon pluralists" who, in contrast to "canon purists," "challenge the notion of a single monolithic mea- sure of excellence" as the primary criterion for inclusion in the canon [12, p. 3]. Specifically, canon pluralists fault this criterion for favoring "works by white European men from middle and higher classes to the exclusion of most works by women, popular artists or writers from other cultures or races" [2, p. 516]. The exclusionary nature of the canon, in turn, is attributed to the various political and social motivations for maintaining an ideological status quo within departments and disci- plines. The construct of the canon as a subjective rather than objective stan- dard has implications for academic libraries, whose collection develop- ment policies are dictated by academic curricula. Manoff points out that "libraries are implicated in movements in identity politics, and
THE POLITICS OF STANDARD SELECTION GUIDES 293 our decisions about who or what gets represented in our collections plays a role in determining what kind of individual and collective iden- tities are authorized or legitimated" [4, pp. 4-5]. These collecting deci- sions are subject to, and ultimately the product of, the series of nested institutional filters described by Harris [1] through which print culture ultimately reaches the library user. The result is that the exclusion of peoples or perspectives from the canon also excludes, for the most part, these same people and perspectives from the library collection, since the frames through which libraries select materials are the prod- uct of the same forces that initially determined the canon. These frames are not limited to course curricula and syllabi but also include book lists used exclusively within the library community to support this curriculum. For example, Connaway examined the representation of women in Books for College Libraries (BCL), using the Norton Anthology of Literature by Women (NALW) as a benchmark. She notes that, "although 80 percent of the authors included in NALWare also included in BCL, the findings indicate that 55 percent of the women excluded from the library field canon are unconventional members of society rather than the societal norm" [6, p. 81]. While the discussion of the role of libraries in canon production and reproduction often centers on an academic or literary canon, librarians utilize a number of other forms of frames, such as review media, in their collection development approaches. As with scholarly canons, these frames are endorsed by individuals or institutions with the means of dictating cultural standards, in this case the producers and reviewers within the broader realm of "mainstream" media. While the protago- nists and context might differ, the result of the process is nonetheless identical-namely, that various institutional filters influence the choices libraries make in their collection development plans. Some of these filters are more obvious than others. Although there is, at first glance, an ever-growing number of media options-every- thing from books and magazines to films and interactive Web sites- this wide range constitutes an illusion of options. Jeffrey Chester and Gary Larson note that "there are more media outlets than ever before, but this numerical growth, as Consumers Union has pointed out, 'has not been accompanied by a comparable growth of independent, di- versely owned . . . media voices'" [13, p. 12]. As a recent issue of the Nation dedicated to the topic of "Big Media" makes clear, this paucity of diverse voices can be traced to the stranglehold that ten media con- glomerates have on the marketplace [14]. Collectively, "The Big Ten" dominate the production and distribution of such formats as movies, books, sports, music, television, radio, magazines, entertainment ven- ues, and the Internet. The Murdoch-controlled News Corporation, for
294 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY example, encompasses HarperCollins publishers, the New York Post, Twentieth-Century Fox, Fox News Channel, TV Guide, and the New York Knicks, to name just a few. Viacom owns CBS, the Movie Channel, Simon & Schuster, Paramount Pictures, and Blockbuster Video. The diversity of formats and venues in the conglomerates' holdings make possible what Robert McChesney describes as "vertical integra- tion, meaning that media firms would not only produce content but would also own the distribution channels that would guarantee places to display and market their wares" [15, p. 21]. Examples of vertical integration abound. Janine Jaquet summarizes a report by the Project for Excellence in Journalism, which found that "morning network news shows spent 33 percent of their air time selling something; on average 20 percent of the stories were for books, movies, TV shows, music or products their company produced" [16, p. 20]. In fact, the synergy that characterizes vertical integration applies not only to mar- keting media products but developing their content as well. As McChes- ney explains, "Media Conglomerates are risk-averse and continually return to what has been commercially successful in the past.... There is little incentive in the system to develop public taste over time" [15, p. 33; emphasis in original]. At the same time, the opportunities for diverse fare reaching the public are limited precisely because the inde- pendent companies most likely to produce it do not have the "cross- selling and cross-promotional opportunities of the media giants" [15, p. 25]. The problem of market censorship is also evident in the world of publishing. Andre Schiffrin, who left Pantheon shortly after it was sub- sumed by Random House (which is now owned by Bertelsmann) to start The New Press, notes that, in 1999, "the top twenty publishers accounted for 93 percent of sales, and the ten largest had 75 percent of revenues" [17, p. 3]. These figures are all the more astounding con- sidering that "50,000 entities are still recognized by the Library of Con- gress as publishers" and that "5 percent of those, or 2,600, are substan- tial enough to be recognized by the Association of American Publishers" [17, p. 7]. Along with the disproportionate distribution of sales among a small number of firms comes a similarly disproportionate representation of firms within the pages of reviewing media. Schiffrin observes that the New York Times Book Review of the 1940s was sixty- four pages long-"twice the length of the current Sunday section" [17, p. 8] -and reviewed books by hundreds of publishing houses, a fact which meant that "the infrastructure of small publishing houses and independent bookstores and book clubs that existed in the 1940s was capable of reaching a very large audience effectively" [17, p. 8].
THE POLITICS OF STANDARD SELECTION GUIDES 295 Conversely, small independent presses operating in the 1990s and 2000s often do not have the financial resources and cross-promotional opportunities to promote their publications in the manner of publish- ing houses owned by "The Big Ten." A company such as Random House not only has a ready-made advertising market in the magazines and book clubs owned by its parent company Bertelsmann but also has "vast advertising budgets at [its] disposal, enormous sales forces, and an extremely efficient network of press contacts, all of which helps en- sure that their books get a certain amount of attention" [17, p. 105]. The consolidation of publishing operations within media conglom- erates also affects the content of what gets published by the major presses. Since the media conglomerates are equally adverse to risk in the book trade, emphasis is placed on acquiring and publishing titles that are predicted to sell in high volume. At the same time, publishers have been forced to abandon the practice whereby "blockbuster" titles could cover any losses incurred by less profitable ones. As Schiffrin explains, the policy is now "that each book should make money on its own and that one title should no longer be allowed to subsidize an- other" [17, p. 91]. Each title is expected to be, in financial terms, a profit center. Since the marketplace usually favors established writers or tried-and-true concepts, major publishing houses will often no longer take a chance on more controversial subjects or the time to cultivate unknown authors who do not come with a ready audience. The result is a significantly decreased and homogenized range of op- tions. The interconnection of corporate synergy, market censorship, and profit centers thus constitutes another form of institutional filter through which cultural materials pass before reaching the library. The books that are finally chosen by libraries have, in effect, already been chosen by others who have financial and corporate influence. Book reviews in library journals are not exempt from such structural consid- erations. Although the review approaches of LibratyJournal and Choice are, as John Calhoun summarizes [18, pp. 127-28], meticulous and balanced, the review process does not exist in a vacuum but, rather, is subject to the same influences that inform the canon formation pro- cess. Nancy Kranich, for example, observes that fewer than "6,000 titles are reviewed each year, most of which are published by fewer than 200 publishers-the largest publishers" and that "often absent from the review media, standard bibliographic tools, and conference exhibits are the alternative, small and/or independent publishers" [19, pp. 7- 8]. According to Byron Anderson, one such tool-the "Best Books" list in the Bowker Annual Library and Book Trade (1999)-had only four
296 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY out of a total of 159 titles published by "alternative presses that were profiled in the Alternative Publishers of Books in North America, 4th ed. (1999)" [20, p. 13]. The myriad factors that inform the canon formation process also call into question the idea that collection development guides such as the PLC simply reflect "the selection of books by consensus of professional judgement" [7, p. 66]. To be sure, the professional judgment of librari- ans is involved, but that professional judgment only occurs after a long line of other types of contingent judgments has been rendered. The recommendations made by such collection development tools as the PLC are, for all intents and purposes, just as contingent as the corpo- rate and financial decisions about which books to publish and which books to promote heavily. Just as the universe of total books available is-on a primary level-filtered, shaped, and ultimately limited by the decisions of large corporate publishers acting on the basis of their own unique institutional pressures, collection development tools operating on a secondary or even tertiary level-filter, shape, and ulti- mately limit the range of options available for libraries by arbitrarily determining a canon that, as the present study demonstrates, has nu- merous shortcomings. Case Study of the Public Library Catalog Graduate students in a library and information science (LIS) program at a major North American university taking an elective course called "Collection Development and Evaluation" in fall 2001 were given a course assignment where they were asked to select a subject area in which they had some expertise and, using their knowledge of this sub- ject area, to comment on the PLC's list of recommended books on the chosen topic. No claim is made that the students are authorities in their chosen fields; rather, they may be considered to be subject experts who have either recently completed a university degree in their chosen field or have a strong personal interest in the selected topic. Eligible subject areas were to have no fewer than three and no more than twenty tides listed in the PLC Students began by identifying which books were listed in the PLC for their subject using the index to the eleventh edi- tion (published in 1999), as well as the indexes in the 1999 and 2000 PLC supplements. They next examined both the annotated entries for these titles in the PLC and actual physical copies of the books. The first part of their written assignments consisted of their analyses of the PLC selections, including their determination of what points of view, ap- proaches, and perspectives were not included in this list. In addition,
THE POLITICS OF STANDARD SELECTION GUIDES 297 students were asked to recommend three to seven titles (published be- fore 1999) that they felt should have been included in the PLC and to write a briefjustification for each of their recommendations. Students were asked to confine themselves to pre-1999 imprints because later books would not have been available to PLC compilers when they were creating the PLC eleventh edition and its 1999 and 2000 supplements. Twenty-three students submitted essays that fulfilled all the criteria for this assignment. The twenty-three subject areas cover an eclectic variety of topics, ranging from rap music to Zen Buddhism to medieval civiliza- tion to chemistry. Table 1 contains a complete list of subject areas cho- sen by students. A content analysis was then made of the submitted assignments of the twenty-three students in order to identify predominant themes and issues across the twenty-three different subject areas they examined. The name of each subject area as listed in the PLC index, as well as a list of the PLC-recommended titles and student-recommended titles for each subject, are presented in a series of tables (tables 3-10).

298 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY ease of reference, subject areas have been arbitrarily grouped together according to the following discipline-based categories: political sci- ence; socioeconomic issues; psychology/pharmacology; language/ writing; religion; arts/literature; natural sciences; and history. To en- sure anonymity, the twenty-three students are identified by twenty- three individual letters of the alphabet. Results Based on the content analysis of students' papers, five predominant themes/issues were identified in their critiques of the PLC These themes, as well as the specific topics to which they apply, are presented in table 2. The first theme/issue was the imbalance of perspectives detected within the PLC's coverage of a particular subject area. Within this theme/issue, students noted the following three subcategories: missing theoretical perspectives that were not included in the PLC's selections for a given field; an overemphasis of a particular topic within, or facet of, a field; and individuals or groups whose voices are missing from the debate as presented in PLC-recommended titles. The second and third major themes were authority and the match between title and topic. Students questioned the authority of some of the PLC books and the relationship between the recommended titles and the topic at hand-a relationship that in some cases they described as rather tenu- ous. Both the incidentalness of title and topic, as well as the noted imbalance of perspectives, led a number of students to recommend books for inclusion in the PLC that present a more comprehensive overview of the subjects they examined, either by providing a better theoretical grounding, a historical framework, or a compendium of viewpoints. The fourth major theme or issue identified was therefore the need for a title or titles that presented a comprehensive framework for the subject area in question. The fifth major theme-divided into three subcategories-encom- passed usability issues. Students repeatedly mentioned that the PLC should better attempt to strike a balance between advanced, scholarly treatments of a subject and books that approached the subject from a more accessible, popular style. These discussions of scholarly versus popular treatments extended to the formatting of the books, as well as the specific tools (indexes, bibliographies, recommendations for fur- ther reading) that they provide. In addition, students also noted the datedness of some of the PLC-recommended books, meaning that cur- rent trends and new advances in a field are not adequately covered. What follows is a detailed look at the points raised in the students'

An Imbalance of Perspectives Missing Theoretical Perspectives An overarching theme of the students' analyses is that the PLC-recom- mended titles excluded a number of key facets or theories that are essential to understanding a particular subject area. In some instances, they felt that this problem resulted from the subject being too narrowly defined across the group of books presented in the PLC This proved to be the case with the books listed under the subject of Environmental Policy-United States, which were examined by student Q (see table 3). Although these four tides "provide significant insight into the topic of environmental policy" [21, p. 1], student Q notes that they do so within the context of a single event or piece of legislation, thereby limiting the reader's ability to gain an overview of the field. John Cronin and Robert Kennedy's The Riverkeepers, for example, "focuses on the battle to clean and protect the Hudson River in New York," while Douglas Chadwick's The Company We Keep is exclusively about the Endangered Species Act [21, p. 2]. Student Q explains, "Although these books illus- trate very good individual examples of environmental policy and the struggles involved, they do not provide the patron with a wider perspec- tive that puts the subject in context" [21, p. 2]. Student Q therefore suggests adding G. Tyler Miller's Living in the Environment: Principles, Connections, and Solutions-"a straightforward and complete explana- tion of environmental policy, how policy is developed, and the influen- tial factors that shape it" [21, p. 1]. At the same time, the specificity
THE POLITICS OF STANDARD SELECTION GUIDES 301 of the PLC titles means that a number of theoretical frameworks that construct the field of environmental policy are not addressed. Identi- fying two of these frameworks as the economics of environmental pol- icy and civic environmentalism, Student Q recommends Environmental Economics: An Elementary Introduction by R. Kerry Turner, David W. Pearce, and Ian Bateman, as well as DeWitt John's Civic Environmen- talism: Alternatives to Regulation in States and Communities to fill these gaps in the PLC. The concept of civic environmentalism-defined as the involvement of "citizens, communities, and businesses working in part- nership with government to design their own solutions to environmen- tal problems close to home rather than accepting top-down legislation from federal or state regulators" [21, pp. 3-4] -is an especially impor- tant lacuna. Another example of this phenomenon was student V, who discussed mineralogy (see table 9). Student V believed that, while the PLC "pro- vides many books that contain illustrations, photographs, and drawings of different minerals, gems, and rocks throughout the world ... as well as crystallography, home laboratory techniques, fossils, manuals, and glossaries" [22, p. 1], it lacks titles that discuss the relationship of min- erals to important life processes. For example, he noted that "the bio- logical and medical implications of minerals in humans or animals are not included" in the PLC [22, p. 1]. In addition, the PLC lacks titles about "minerals applied to plants, economic aspects, industrial pro- cesses (that is, extraction and mining), environmental (that is, toxicity and law), lunar mineralogy, and minerals in soil" [22, p. 1]. According to student V, libraries that follow only the PLC recommendations would get a very myopic view of the world of mineralogy, and he therefore recommends such titles as Inside Mining: The Economics of the Supply and Demand of Minerals and Metals, Screening and Surveillance of Workers Ex- posed to Mineral Dust, and Mineral Nutrition of Higher Plants. Conversely, some students felt that the PLC list for their subject area could be improved by including books that did not treat the topic in such a general manner. One example is the subject of organic garden- ing, examined by student K (see table 4). This individual found that the thirteen titles on the PLC list, including a number from the well- recognized Rodale Press, "are all good reference books, written or compiled by experts in the field and based on sound gardening princi- ples" [23, p. 2]. Yet, student K also points out: "Gardening is not a subject that will always benefit from a general approach. An experi- enced gardener may be able to find the information he/she needs in the encyclopaedic format favoured by so many gardening books but the beginner may well be confused" [23, p. 2]. In fact, all but two of the PLC-recommended books follow the type of encyclopedic format found in works such as Rodale's All-New Encyclopedia of Organic Gardening

306 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY and The Big Book of Gardening Secrets. Student K proposes that this type of book be balanced with works that are dedicated to "specific garden practices such as improving the soil, mulching, and composting" [23, p. 1 ]. Her specific recommendations include Stu Campbell's Let It Rot, which "demystify[ies] what goes on in the compost pile" [23, p. 2] and Controlling Weeds by Erin Hynes. Overemphasis of a Particular Facet or Theory wfithin a Field The broad scope and encyclopedic nature of the thirteen PLC tides on organic gardening prompted student K to characterize these books as being "of the problem-solving variety" [23, p. 1]. This focus on proW lem solving, while certainly a fundamental dimension of organic gar- dening, resulted in the exclusion of another important facet of this topic-what the student refers to as "gardening as a political act" and "the radical school of organic gardening" [23, pp. 3-4]. Indeed, she observes that "for this point of view you would have to look beyond the two established publishers in the field, Rodale and Storey, which between them have produced all thirteen books in the PLC list, to the smaller publishers" [23, p. 4] -a suggestion that highlights the impor- tance of moving beyond a small group of publishers in order to achieve diversity of viewpoints. Accordingly, one of the books she recommends, Greening the Garden: A Guide to Sustainable Growingby DanJason, engages the "think globally, act locally" debate and examines the controversies surrounding genetically modified food as well as "seed politics" [23, p. 5]. Another issue completely overlooked by the PLC selectors centers around the question of lawns, a topic that student K observes is "be- coming a battleground between traditionalists and environmentalists" [23, p. 4]. She therefore recommends a book-Redesigning the American Lawn: A Search for Environmental Harmony by Herbert Bormann, Diana Balmori, Gordon Geballe, and Lisa Vernegaard-that not only pro- vides "statistical evidence about the economical and environmental costs of maintaining a lawn" but also explains why "Americans should abandon their allegiance to the 'Industrial Lawn' and instead embrace the ecologically sound 'Freedom Lawn"' [23, p. 5; see table 5]. In fact, a number of students found that the exclusion from the PLC list of prominent facets or theories within a field went hand-in-hand with a preponderance of titles that defined a given subject area ac- cording to a single theme or issue. Student A, who looked at the PLC's recommendations for the topic of personality, points out that two of the six books focused exclusively on "the genetic basis of personality" [24, p. 1]. At the same time, she found that this list did not cover a number of social, cultural, environmental, and psychological factors that impact personality development. Similarly, student M noted that the PLC books on social change primarily "support the status quo" or
THE POLITICS OF STANDARD SELECTION GUIDES 307 assume "a very pro-capitalist stance" [25, p. 1; see table 4). Specifically, these seven books fail to address populist, humanist, or socialist per- spectives. She links this shortcoming to the fact that five of the seven PLC titles are by the same two authors:John Naisbitt of Megatrends fame and Alvin Toffler, whose books regard individuals "as inactive recipi- ents of change, as responders rather than agents" [25, p. 1]. Student M therefore advises expanding the range of authors in order to provide readers with a broader range of theoretical perspectives, including John Isbister's Promises Not Kept: The Betrayal of Social Change in the Third World, which offers a complex and nuanced reading that "looks at his- torical, capitalist imperatives that created the conditions under which many countries still struggle today" [25, p. 2], and Paula Allman's Revolutionary Social Transformation: Democratic Hopes, Political Possibilities and Critical Education, which "draws on the intellectual developments of Friere and Gramsci to propose social transformation" rooted in a broad definition of education as "cultural action and political thought" [25, pp. 4-5]. Student N found that books recommended by the PLC on rhetoric define this topic in the mold of William Strunk's The Elements of Style, focusing on the mechanics of writing style such as "principles of clear and concise writing" and "rules of correctness of usage" [26, p. 2]. Missing from the PLC are books that deal with rhetoric as "social inter- action" [26, p. 10], discuss the cognitive elements of the writing pro- cess, and treat writing "as a discovery and growing process rather than presenting prescriptive guidelines for people to follow" [26, p. 6]. Fi- nally, student W observed that books recommended by the PLC about the Korean War concentrated almost exclusively "on the political and military background and causes" of this conflict from an American perspective [27, p. 1; see table 3]). Missing were books that discussed the international flavor of the war, the cultural and artistic legacy of the war, and its unfinished nature, as manifested in the unification movement of the two Koreas. The student therefore recommended such works as Blood on the Hills: The Canadian Army in the Korean War, A Guide to Films on the Korean War, Retrieving Bones: Stories and Poems of the Korean War, and Korea and Its Futures: Unification and the Unfinished War (see table 6). Both the organic gardening and rhetoric examples seem to indicate an emphasis within the PLC list on titles that address the more practical or problem-solving aspects of these topics, as opposed to books that take a more philosophical approach. In essence, these topics are con- structed within the PLC according to books designed to answer the question of "how to" without necessarily delving into the historical or theoretical questions of "why." This was also the case with the PLC selections on the topic ofJewish holidays (see table 7). Student S noted

314 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY that five of the nine titles cited were cookbooks, such as Marlene Soro- sky's Fast and Festive Meals for the Jeunsh Holidays and the New York Times Passover Cookbook. She explained that the cookbooks, "while providing brief background information ... do not significantly add to a reader's knowledge of these holidays" [28, p. 1]. Moreover, she discovered that the noncookbook titles mentioned by the PLC all are written from a conservative or borderline conservative-orthodox Judaic perspective. Therefore, the PLC books "do not adequately cover the broad spec- trum ofJewish religious observance, which can be roughly divided into three streams: Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform" [28, p. 1]. The student recommends including not only more informative sources but also sources that represent each of the three Judaic streams. The idea that by defining a subject area according to a single theme or facet, the PLC does "not significantly add to a reader's knowledge" of a subject area is discussed by student G as well (see table 8). This individual examined the five titles recommended on the subject of rap music. She found that, with the exception of Tricia Rose's Black Noise, the remaining four books construct a perspective of rap music through "eye-pleasing design and use of hip language" [29, p. 3] that is geared toward adolescents. In the process, the student explains, the popular, consumerist-driven idea of rap music as all "dope sound system" and "fly gear" is reinforced [29, p. 3], while the music's "substantive con- tent and its image of [a] politically conscious subculture" is ignored [29, p. 3]. Student J observes that the problem of equating a subject or field of study with a single facet or theory has implications not only for how that subject area is defined but also for the connections made between a subject and other fields of study. Examining the titles on sociobiology listed in the PLC, he concludes that "all three books make a general claim that human behaviour and social organization reflect a biological imperative" [30, p. 1; see table 9]. In addition to presenting a rather limited scope of "the scientific principles underlying sociobiology" [30, p. 1], the fact that all three works espouse similar theories has implications beyond this field. StudentJ points out that "the political conclusions taken from sociobiological research must also be ad- dressed" [30, p. 2], citing the example of Matt Ridley's The Origin of Virtue: Human Instincts and the Evolution of Cooperation, which was recom- mended by the PLC Addressing the issue of cooperation from a Dar- winian perspective, Ridley "proposes a view of human society based on government non-interference and a reliance on private sector and free market principles" [30, p. 1]. There is a risk, then, that books endors- ing the concept of human behavior as genetically driven would follow "neo-conservative philosophy [which] is supported by social Darwinist
THE POLITICS OF STANDARD SELECTION GUIDES 315 thought, which is itself grounded in sociobiology" [30, p. 4]. To counter this, studentJ recommends including in the PLC a book such as Vaulting Ambition: Sociobiology and the Quest for Human Nature by Philip Kitcher, which calls into question "many of the more popular sociobio- logical claims about humans" while addressing "methodological prob- lems with the field and . .. general difficulties involved with attempting to apply a natural sciences paradigm to the study of human and social behaviour" [30, p. 3]. In addition, Kitcher's book has the virtue of posing "some challenging questions regarding the ideological assump- tions inherent in many 'scientific' programs," questions that are all the more important because "science has often been used to defend the status quo and has acted as an instrument of social control," as in the field of eugenics [30, p. 3]. Titles such as this one exhibit a healthy skepticism about the tenets of sociobiology, thus providing a balance to the "pro-sociobiological approach to human behaviour" [30, p. 1] that studentJ detects in the PLC titles. Missing Voices Rather than the absence of theories or facets of a topic, some students identified missing voices-a lack of representation of specific groups- within the books recommended by the PLC. The issues raised by these students echo a number of criticisms that surface in the literary canon debate. Students R and T, for example, encountered very few books that either were written by or were about women in the context of the topics they examined. Student R describes the PLC books on the French Revolution as similar to "most histories of the Revolution" in that they "only briefly mention any contributions that women made" [31, p. 2] or tend to focus instead on Queen Marie-Antoinette (see table 10). Student R therefore recommends adding Linda Kelly's Women of the French Revolution to the PLC. Kelly's book examines "what women were trying to accomplish ... what rights they lost and why their movement failed to improve things as much as they wanted to" by "looking at events through the eyes of different women" who wit- nessed the events firsthand [31, p. 2]. Student T, who looked at the PLC recommendations for Christian theology, notes that these books do not provide a feminist perspective on the topic (see table 7). She remarks that the theologians repre- sented in volumes such as Great Thinkers of the Western World and Great Christian Thinkers, are "for the most part ... dead, white, male, Euro- pean, Catholics or Lutherans, and in some cases are now considered quite orthodox" [32, p. 2]. Missing from these collected writings are the voices of women theologians or spiritual writers. The student did find a better representation from the four titles under the heading

322 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY of "Women-Religious Life," including Sherry Ruth Anderson's The Feminine Face of God and Wise Women: Over Two Thousand Years of Spiritual Writing ly Women. These titles, however, were not cross-referenced with the Christian theology heading. Furthermore, student T still noted a dearth of information on "feminist theology, ecofeminism, and libera- tion theology" [32, p. 3]. She proposes, then, that the PLC include books such as Feminist Theology: A Reader and An A to Z of Feminist Theol- ogy in order to provide users with a feminist perspective on Christian theology. In fact, the call for a feminist perspective is not limited to the social sciences but extends to the natural sciences as well. Student J, for example, suggests adding Lynda Birke's Women, Feminism, and Biology: The Feminist Challenge to the PLC's list of books on the topic of sociobiology (see table 9). He explains that "this work is one of the few books that offer[s] a feminist critique of sociobiology" [30, p. 4], with Birke delineating a connection between the political motivations of scientific research and the subordinate roles traditionally assigned to women. In addition to downplaying the role or contributions of women in various fields, some students also characterized the books listed in the PLC as having a decidedly Western bent. Student L found this to be the case with the PLC tides on medieval civilization. To avoid having an abundance of books offering only a "Western, Christian, male-centric exploration of the Middle Ages" [33, p. 2], she recommends that the PLC include titles that cover each of the following areas: "women in the Middle Ages," "Islamic and Jewish civilizations in the Middle Ages," and "Eastern civilizations in the Middle Ages" [33, pp. 4-8]. Indeed, a number of students mentioned that the PLC titles for given subject areas were lacking a global perspective. Student E and student Q each came to this conclusion regarding the subject areas of homeless persons and United States environmental policy. While both of these topics center on problems and policies in the United States, each stu- dent contends that these issues need to be examined within a broader, globalized context. Student E states that the PLC list on homeless per- sons could benefit from the inclusion of Irene Glasser's Homelessness in Global Perspective, which "provides data and surveys from numerous regions around the world" and "brings to light the similarities of the problem globally" [34, pp. 4-5; see table 4]. Similarly, student Q ob- serves that "environmental problems are trans-national" and that "one country's policies will affect not only their own nation, but also the global [community]" [21, p. 4]. Concluding that the PLC's coverage of United States environmental policy "could be improved by includ- ing what is happening around the world," she recommends the book From Promises to Performance: Achieving Global Environmental Goals by Gary
THE POLITICS OF STANDARD SELECTION GUIDES 323 Bryner, which "discusses the challenges that are involved in preserving the global environment" (table 3). Some students identified missing voices in the context of specific debates within a field of study. One example is student C, who analyzed the PLC recommendations on the topic of China: foreign relations- United States (see table 3). She explains that the five books recom- mended by the PLC primarily focus on the factors that influenced the development of United States foreign policy toward China. The prob lem, however, is these works "largely ignore the Chinese perspective" [35, p. 1]. In order to remedy this problem, she suggests that the PLC include Foreign Relations of the People's Republic of China by John W. Garver. Garver, she notes, "attempts to look at Sino-American relations from a Chinese perspective" by using "Chinese sources, such as writ- ings of major Chinese political figures" [35, p. 2]. She also recom- mends adding After the Cold War: Domestic Factors and U.S.-China Rela- tions, a title that is the result of "collaboration between academics in the United States and China," as another means of reducing "bias and error" [35, p. 3]. Student U also observed a bias toward the American perspective in the PLC's recommendations, in this case in the context of books on the subject of "motion pictures: history and criticism" (see table 8). In particular, he observes that the PLC's list is dedicated al- most exclusively to the history of American film and eschews works of criticism and theory that take issue with the traditional American view of motion pictures: "By short-shrifting the critical works in favour of those historical, the compositors of the PLC have avoided ideological challenges, an act which is in itself ideological" [36, p. 2]. Critical and theoretical works, he continues, show that "there is more than one way-the established way-ofjudging films" [36, p. 6]. Concentrating on the history of film risks losing "the personal, idiosyncratic, and vi- sionary aspects of film criticism" at a time when "the art-of film as well as criticism-has become soullessly technologised" [36, p. 6]. Authority Closely related to the issue of missing voices is the authority of those whose work is endorsed by the PLC. Student F would like to see more primary sources recommended on the topic of Victorian Britain, ar- guing that contemporaneous works "are essential for an understand- ing of any historical period" [37, p. 1; see table 10). Student A ques- tions the credentials of an author represented on the PLC list for the subject of personality. Citing the example of the PLC-recommended title Reading People, she explains that the author, Jo-Ellan Dimitrius,
324 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY "offers an approach to making judgements about people based on their appearance and actions" that was formed during "her years of observation as a jury consultant" [24, p. 1; see table 5). The student contends, however, that Dimitrius "offers no theoretical basis for judgements" and that the book "certainly shouldn't be called psychol- ogy, and it really isn't about personality either" [24, p. 1]. In other instances, students questioned the authority of those repre- sented in the PLC by citing the credentials of other authors they felt should have been included. Student U, for example, registers surprise that the works of Graham Greene, James Agee, and Sergei Eisenstein are not included in the PLC's list of books on "motion pictures: history and criticism," describing these three individuals as "not only great critics, but also great practitioners" [36, p. 3]. When recommending John Garver's work on United States-Chinese relations, student C com- mends the fact that Garver "is fluent in Chinese and travels in the Far East frequently" [35, p. 2; see table 3). She goes on to comment that "his knowledge in Chinese affairs far exceeds some American diplo- mats who do not even know the language and only travel to China occasionally for short periods" [35, p. 2]. Underscoring the student's praise of Garver's work and implicit criticism of the PLC titles is the idea that a writer's authority on a subject stems in part from his or her status within or connection to the group, community, or nation being examined. This issue is also raised in student G's critique of the titles on the subject of rap music (see table 8). She notes, for example, that PLC-recommended Hip Hop America by Nelson George "aim[s] to bridge the language/cultural gap experienced by an individual outside the hip hop culture" [29, p. 2]. The problem, however, is twofold. First, by aiming to reach readers outside of this culture, George's work does not meet the information needs of "individuals already part of the cul- ture [who are] interested in furthering their knowledge" [29, p. 2]. In fact, student G points out that the information needs of this group are not adequately addressed by any of the works listed in the PLC At the same time, George himself "often misuses terms" [29, p. 2], signi- fying his own status as someone outside of the culture he discusses. While not suggesting that only members of the hip hop culture possess the authority to write about this subject, student G does raise the point that those who are part of the culture offer a unique and valuable per- spective that should be represented in the PLC The Match between Title and Topic To be sure, not all students found that the PLC lacked key perspectives or voices in a given subject area. Student I, for example, commends
THE POLITICS OF STANDARD SELECTION GUIDES 325 the PLC for striving to achieve a balance in the books listed under the topic of Zen Buddhism (see table 7). He observes that these four titles could be assigned to the following categories: "the history/philosophy of Zen," "Zen practice," and" Zen Literature" [38, p. 2], thereby pro- viding a comprehensive overview of the subject area. In addition, he writes that the PLC "recognized the need for mixed perspectives and interpretations of Zen by including equal number of works [by] East- ern and Western writers" [38, p. 2]. Interestingly, while the majority of students faulted the overall representation of perspectives and voices representing their subject area in the PLC, student I felt that the major facets of his topic were well covered. His praise, however, extends only to how the subject area is structured categorically, rather than to the specific titles selected for each of these facets. He writes: "As much as I can agree with the set-up of the PLC list, I have to totally disagree with the choice of books that were applied to the three chosen categories. [These] books (excluding Essential Zen) do not match the standards established by the PLC's editor" [38, pp. 2-3]. More specifically, the books in some cases do not actually match the subject area to which they were assigned. He provides the example of The Snow Leopard by Peter Matthiessen, arguing that it "has nothing to do with Zen Bud- dhism" [38, p. 3]. Instead, he describes it as "a travel memoir" [38, p. 3] of a journey the author made to Nepal in 1973, with Matthiessen reflecting on "an extensive number of topics, from observations of fauna and flora of [the] Himalayan mountains, to ... his exposure to a new culture" [38, p. 3]. And while Buddhism is a part of this culture, the student feels that characterizing The Snow Leopard as being about Zen Buddhism is misleading. In fact, student I was not alone in pointing out the frequently prob- lematic relationship between a particular subject area and the PLC ti- tles meant to represent that topic. Student A's comment that Jo-Ellan Dimitrius' Reading People "certainly shouldn't be called psychology, and it really isn't about personality either" [24, p. 1] is one such exam- ple. A second example comes from student P who, in examining the recommended books on fossil hominids, notes that Milford Wolpoff's Race and Human Evolution "fundamentally ... is not about fossil homi- nids," characterizing it instead as "a historical examination of race theory in paleoanthropology" [39, p. 1]. The Need for a Comprehensive Framework Concluding that the PLC overemphasized particular theories or per- spectives while excluding others, students offered a number of solu- tions to this problem. Some felt that the PLC should include more titles
326 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY that could provide the reader with either an overview of, or contextual framework for, a given topic. The idea would be to furnish readers with a historical or theoretical grounding before they tackled the more specific theories and topics discussed, but not necessarily contextual- ized, in the books recommended by the PLC At the same time, the reader would gain a more complete picture of how a field or subject area has evolved and would be introduced to the various individuals who have contributed to its development. Observing that the "PLC does not offer a comprehensive theoretical framework for the subject of personality, but rather bits and pieces" [24, p. 21, student A suggests that an undergraduate-level textbook on personality development be included: "The PLC list offers little historical background for the de- velopment of various theories, and no overarching works that look at all the areas presently being studied" [24, p. 2]. She explains that a textbook such as Personality: An Integrated Approach by Stephen Mayer and Karen Sutton would not only "offer a more integrated overview of personality" [24, p. 3] than the PLC recommended books but would also "be more accessible to those who do not have previous training in psychology" [24, p. 3; see table 5). In addition, she notes that this text would contextualize for the reader the individual theories set forth in PLC titles such as Becoming: Basic Considerations for a Psychology of Per- sonality by Gordon Allport, which she describes as "a seminal work in the field of personality development" [24, p. 1]. Yet, while Allport's book "deserves a place in any library" [24, p. 1], student A stresses that it needs to be balanced with titles that explain how such seminal works "fit into the framework of personality theory" [24, p. 1]. The idea of supplementing PLC-recommended titles with textbooks geared toward undergraduates was also proposed by student D. This individual found seven titles listed under the subject of chemistry, one of which is a dictionary, two of which are under the PLC-supplied cate- gory "Tables," with the remaining four listed under "History" (see table 9). While describing the history of chemistry as "important," the student also notes that "it isjust one area of the extensive field of chem- istry," prompting him to characterize the preponderance of books with a historical focus as "unjustified" [40, p. 2]. Specifically, he explains that books such as Hugh Salzberg's From Caveman to Chemist: Circum- stances and Achievements, which "traces the history of chemistry from prehistoric time to the year 1900" [40, p. 1], and the Norton History of Chemistry tend to refer to chemical terms and concepts while providing the reader with only "very sketchy and often confusing explanations of these concepts" [40, p. 1]. The result, therefore, is that it would "be very difficult for those who are not familiar with these concepts to get a sense of what they are about" [40, pp. 1-2]. At the same time,
THE POLITICS OF STANDARD SELECTION GUIDES 327 the two titles listed under "Tables" in the PLC-the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics and Lange's Handbook of Chemistry-consist primar- ily of conversion and physical constant tables, leading student D to comment that "such data is of little use to someone who has no knowl- edge of the underlying principles" [40, p. 2]. Student D's solution is to include in the PLC a comprehensive text, such as David Oxtoby and Norman Nachtrieb's Principles of Modern Chemistry, that "introduces many of the most basic principles of chemistry" [40, p. 3]. Another approach suggested by students for incorporating a wider range of perspectives on a topic is to add to the PLC list books that compile a variety of viewpoints or theories. For example, in order to present a more balanced view of the field of sociobiology, student J recommends The Sociobiology Debate, explaining that this volume in- cludes "essays by over thirty people [in] the field" [30, p. 5], including authors found on the PLC sociobiology list (see table 9). The fact that these essays run the gamut from Charles Darwin to Stephen Jay Gould enables the reader not only to be exposed to a variety of schools of thought within the field but also to get a sense of the evolution of the theories themselves and the historical context in which they were devel- oped. Likewise, student P, who examined the PLC's recommended ti- tles on the topic of fossil hominids, notes that this field is rife with internal debates-for example, the "eternal 'lumpers versus splitters' schism ... over how many fossil species there are, how to name them, and how to arrange family trees" [39, p. 2]. Yet, the books recom- mended by the PLC either ignore these debates or present only one side of them. To remedy this situation, student P suggests including Bones of Contention: Controversies in the Search for Human Origins by Roger Lewin, a book that highlights key figures "and their conflicts with one another ... to show how the field operates" [39, p. 2]. He concludes that "the advantage of having this book in the library would be to dem- onstrate that the contents of the other books [are] nowhere near as clear-cut as some of them would have you believe" [39, p. 3]. Similarly, student R proposes adding The French Revolution: Conflicting Interpreta- tions to the PLC because "this book gives readers a chance to easily compare the way different historians interpret ten different important events of the French Revolution" [31, p. 3]. Usability Striking a Balance between Scholarly and Accessible Titles Underlying the idea of providing readers with a contextual framework on a subject area is a recognition that the PLC needs to strike a balance
328 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY between scholarly and accessible treatments of these topics. Student I, for example, characterizes Daisetz Teitero Suzuki's The Manual of Zen, which is recommended by the PLC, as "focusing mainly on materials related to monastic life that 99 percent of potential readers would not be able to follow or even understand" [38, p. 3]. He continues: "Su- zuki's works in general are directed to experienced Zen students and are highly specialized in one specific and very narrow aspect of Zen each time, which require [s] from the reader [a] wide-ranging under- standing of Buddhist doctrines and concepts" [38, pp. 3-4]. In her discussion of the PLC titles on the subject of rap music, stu- dent G suggests that librarians develop specific categories to aid in the collection development process. She offers the following categories as guidelines: reference works, history, cultural criticism, political ideol- ogy, and biography. Following these categories would, on the one hand, produce a more balanced picture of Rap music-one that does not, as is the case with the PLC's coverage, overlook rap music's role "as a resistance cultural transmission mode" [29, p. 3] and a form of political ideology. On the other hand, the student also explains that collecting according to these categories would "ensure that a beginner will not be overwhelmed with contradictory or overly scholarly informa- tion, and [that] a serious researcher will not have to sift through fan- zine-like information" [29, p. 4], such as the preponderance of "who's who" type materials listed in the PLC Indeed, the specific titles that the student recommends for each of her categories reflect this goal (see table 8). In the "Reference Works" category, which she defines as "material that contains current information about the language, lyrical development, and styles of Rap music" [29, p. 5], she includes Fresh Fly Flavor: Words and Phrases of the HipHop Generation, which "offers a comprehensive glossary [of] more than four-hundred Rap terms and African American musical idioms" [29, p. 5]. While Fresh Fly Flavor would especially benefit the novice reader, Geneva Smitherman's Black Talk: Words and Phrases from the Hood to the Amen Corner delves even fur- ther into "the definitions, etymology, parts of speech and usage" [29, p. 5] of the vocabulary of rap music and its lyrical development and would therefore be especially useful for those conducting in-depth re- search on the subject. Student H points out that addressing information needs at multiple levels is especially imperative in the case of dictionaries. Examining the Russian-English/English-Russian dictionaries recommended by the PLC, she concludes that they "would be of great help to linguists, spe- cialists of literature, or [individuals] with an intermediate knowledge of both languages looking for a translation of a single word or phrase" [41, p. 1; see table 6). Notably absent from this list, however, are tools
THE POLITICS OF STANDARD SELECTION GUIDES 329 that are geared toward the beginner or novice speaker. Citing the ex- ample of Collin's Concise Oxford Russian Dictionary, she explains that "most of the information related to the use of grammar or pronuncia- tion . . . requires previous knowledge about phonetics or some basics in comparative grammar" [41, p. 31. In addition, the dictionaries in the PLCdo not always indicate how words assume different connotations in various contexts. Her solution is to include The Oxford Starter Russian Dictionary in the PLC, which, in addition to standard definitions, pro- vides "examples from contemporary real life" [41, p. 8] of how words are used, as well as "tables and guides for declensions and conjugations and pronunciation" [41, p. 8]. In fact, the need to balance advanced-level and accessible works in the case of dictionaries concerns not only the linguistic level of the intended user but also the dictionary's emphasis on colloquial versus more formal usage of the language. One particularly vivid example provided by student H concerns The Random House Russian-English Dic- tionary of Idioms, which attempts "to show words in context in colloquial Russian" [41, p. 2]. The dictionary, while presenting idiomatic expres- sions, does so "using [literary] examples from works of Pushkin, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Chekhov, Solzhenitsyn, and others" [41, p. 2]. The student comments: "Few would agree that the phraseology and terminology of Solzhenitsyn, not to mention the classical writers of the nineteenth century, is the colloquial or idiomatic language of the Rus- sian population at the beginning of the 21st century. This is a proper, formal, and literary language, and it is not used as everyday communi- cation" [41, p. 2]. In addition, she noticed that only two of the seven PLC-recommended dictionaries- The Penguin Russian Dictionary and The Oxford English-Russian Dictionary-include any words or phrases that could be characterized as slang. She points out that slang, defined as common colloquial expressions, can serve as a bridge "between liter- ary and everyday contemporary language" [41, p. 2]. The exclusion of slang from the recommended dictionaries means that the relationship between language and culture remains largely unexplored, especially because "slang and colloquialisms are used in everyday expressions as well as in professional life, for instance in journalism, politics, business, banking, culture (ballet, music) ... and there is a constant use and development of slang among specific groups such as youth, schools, universities, sports, army, etc." [41, p. 9]. A work specifically and exten- sively dealing with slang such as the Dictionary of Slang and Colloquial Expressions should therefore be part of the PLC list. Moreover, student H points out that none of the dictionaries recom- mended by the PLC would be of much use to "highly skilled profession- als" [41, p. 1] because the "technical lexicon is limited and of second-
330 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY ary importance," so much so that The Stoddart Visual Dictionary by Jean- Claude Corbeil .. . provides more entries on scientific and technical information than all the Russian-English dictionaries recommended by the PLC" [41, pp. 1-2]. Because much contemporary communication is centered around and makes use of technical terms, it is important to have Russian-English and English-Russian dictionaries specifically devoted to medical, scientific, technological, and business terminol- ogy-dictionaries that could be productively used by busy professionals who frequently work with Russian documents, organizations, and indi- viduals in the twenty-first century. Datedness Student H's criticism that the Russian-English dictionaries recom- mended by the PLC collectively do not give sufficient weight to contem- porary idiomatic and technical expressions introduces the issue of datedness. A number of students found that the PLC titles for their topic area seemed out of date. For instance, student I writes about Alan Watts's The Way of Zen as follows: "When [his] book was published in 1957, it was most likely one of the best books on Zen on the market" [38, p. 4]. He notes, however, that numerous works on Zen Buddhism have been published since that time-books that "outshine Watts" and that present a vivid contrast to his "way too shallow" analysis and "too scholarly" explanations [38, p. 4]. In some cases, the datedness of the PLC list was linked to the overem- phasis of a particular type of book or topic within a given subject area. Student G, for instance, notes that the "who's who" type of book found on the PLC list of books on rap music becomes quickly outdated. Stu- dents K and N observe that the PLC does not adequately cover new areas of research in the fields they chose to examine. Student K, for instance, notes that "in general the books on the PLC list all assume a middle-of-the-road approach to gardening [because] [t] hey meet the needs of the average gardener who has decided to avoid the use of chemicals, [and where] the end result is still recognizably what every- one would agree is a garden, a plot of land designed and controlled by a gardener" [23, p. 5]. As an antidote to this "middle-of-the-road approach," she provides the example of the naturalistic movement in organic gardening, which moves beyond the domain of a chemical and pesticide-free garden to challenge the notion of what exactly consti- tutes a garden. She explains that the "hallmarks of this approach in- clude the use of native plants and wildflowers, a move away from formal garden design, and a strong emphasis on environmental concerns"
THE POLITICS OF STANDARD SELECTION GUIDES 331 [23, p. 5]. None of the PLC books, however, address this subject. Simi- larly, student N felt that, because of its narrow definition of rhetoric as simply the mechanics of writing, the PLC "does not reflect the new trend in rhetorical studies"-namely, the focus on the role of inven- tion in the writing process [26, p. 3]. She concludes that the PLC list could "be modified by adding some of the books that reflect the devel- opment of rhetorical studies in the 20th century" [26, p. 3]. Tools and Formatting For many students, the discussion of the usability of the PLC-recom- mended titles focused on the specific tools or features that the books did or did not provide. Student B, who examined the PLC titles on the subject of classical mythology, notes that the contents of these books are arranged "in alphabetical order [according to a] name or event" [42, p. 2; see table 6). She explains that this across-the-board organiza- tional approach "limits the usability of these works" [42, p. 2], observ- ing that many individuals, including researchers, might appreciate the availability of resources that provide access based on topics, rather than simply names. Citing Robert Bell's Dictionary of Classical Mythology: Sym- bols, Att7ibutes, and Associations as an example, she suggests that "the topical approach" [42, p. 4] of this resource would enable individuals to trace particular topics through Greek and Roman mythology. Simi- larly, student 0 notes that the consumer guides included among the PLC's recommended titles on drugs and nonprescription drugs fail to provide an index that collocates alternate trade names (including ge- neric names) of various medications [43, pp. 2-3; see table 5). She explains that this greatly diminishes the usefulness of these guides, be- cause a user might search in vain for information concerning a particu- lar medication that is listed under an unfamiliar name. Significantly, the tool most frequently identified as missing from the PLC-recommended books is a list of recommendations for further reading. As student L points out in her critique of the PLC books on medieval civilization, "not every book on a given topic can be included in the collection; therefore, the provision of a bibliography that sug- gests other sources of information becomes an important consider- ation" [33, p. 3]. Student B raises this same point in her discussion about classical mythology books. She notes that, while the PLC-recom- mended Encyclopedia of Greco-Roman Mythology "includes an extensive bibliography," it is not the type of tool that readers could use to identify "sources ... or further readings for particular subjects" [42, p. 2]. She concludes that, given the variations in these tales, it would be especially
332 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY helpful for the PLC to include "books that indicate the different ver- sions of the myths that exist and include extensive references for more detailed study" [42, p. 2]. Discussion As Quinn points out, attempts to make the canon more inclusive often fixate on an insupportable ideal of all-inclusiveness. He writes that "after a certain point, literary 'worth' becomes devalued or meaning- less, as the point of infinite expansion is approached" [12, p. 2]. Bill Katz concurs, arguing that "the notion that everything is equal.. . flies in the face of common sense and experience" [44, p. 192]. Rather than assume an anticanonist perspective that calls for the abolishment of "best books" lists, he suggests that the library community instead should turn its attention to "how to modify [the lists] to meet the needs of specific readers" [44, p. 192]. Because a standardized list, the PLC is intended to consolidate within one volume the "best books" available on particular subjects as deter- mined "by consensus of professional judgement" [7, p. 88]. The stu- dents' critiques presented in this study have not only demonstrated particular shortcomings of the PLC but also indicated ways "to modify [it] to meet the needs of specific readers" [7, p. 89]. Many of the spe- cific criticisms-such as the exclusion of women and the lack of diver- sity-echo the literary canon debate. As Judith Serebnick and Frank Quinn point out, "The professional literature, including textbooks on collection development, attests to the continuing dominance of quality and demand standards. However, a diversity standard also is strongly supported" [45, p. 7]. Indeed, the idea that "the widest diversity of viewpoints is essential" to library collections [45, p. 7] applies to both the representation of particular groups and the recognition of specific theories and facets within a field. Students' analyses also pinpointed a number of areas where the PLC provides an incomplete picture of a subject area, either by overlooking or overemphasizing particular top- ics. Because the PLC is geared toward both public and small undergrad- uate libraries, this problem affects how a field of study is defined, as well as "local and national research patterns" [4, p. 8]. For instance, Manoff explains that, for undergraduates in an introductory psychol- ogy course who are writing papers on "the impact of birth order on personality formation . . . the handful of books found on the shelves of the library may well define the field. This is especially true for the student who is disinclined to make use of interlibrary loan" [4, p. 9]. The implications of this scenario become especially vivid in light of the
THE POLITICS OF STANDARD SELECTION GUIDES 333 comments made by student A regarding the lack of a comprehensive framework and overemphasis of particular theories within the PLC's selected titles on personality development. Given the effect that collection development choices can have on how a field of study is constructed and the voices that define that field, suggestions made by some students of including a comprehensive text or a compendium of theories for a subject area seem valid. Indeed, the recommendation by studentJ (sociobiology) that the PLC include books that are skeptical of a field addresses Quinn's point that "true pluralism means that, along with unconventional criticism, [libraries] should try to select books that present all sides of the debate" [ 12, p. 5]. While the issue of pluralism is crucial to an evaluation of collection development tools, students' criticisms about the usability of the PLC also should not be overlooked. Although problems with datedness and formatting fall outside the usual canon debates, they nonetheless call into question the notion of the PLC as a "best books" list. The concerns that the twenty-three students expressed need to be examined not only in terms of the standards that the PLC strives to meet but also the fact that the PLC is a tool that standardizes library collections. As Haines, writing in 1950, explains in her favorable review of book selection aids, these tools operate "on the principle that books carefully chosen as desirable for one library of a particular type will be suitable for others of the same general character" [7, p. 88]. Harris bluntly assesses the potential effects of this principle, explaining that "librarians across the country are capable of building collections of remarkable uniformity via the use of an extremely limited number of 'frames' in the book selection process" [1, p. 243]. Quinn, in turn, has linked this potential for homogeneity to the McDonaldization process [46]. The term "McDonaldization" was developed by sociologist George Ritzer to describe the phenomenon whereby services and pro- cedures once subject to the fluctuations of human interaction undergo a rationalization process that emphasizes efficiency, predictability, cal- culability, and control [47]. Ritzer illustrates this process using the fast- food chain's modus operandi: "McDonaldized systems generally insti- tute [routinized] procedures in order to control what employees, cus- tomers and many others (e.g. suppliers) do. And those procedures exist in order to deal with recurrent situations (e.g. the ordering of goods or services by customers)" [48, p. 17]. The result is a sense of "dehu- manization and homogeneity" that stems from "methods that leave ... employees with little or no room for personal decision making" [48, p. 18]. Although named after the fast-food industry, Ritzer has noted the expansion of the McDonaldization process to a variety of situations and
334 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY venues, including credit cards, theme parks, and universities. In de- scribing what he terms the "McUniversity," Ritzer explains that, as po- tential students and their parents increasingly "adopt a consumerist orientation" to higher education by "looking at cost, quality and con- venience when choosing a school ... to get the best product for their money," universities will meet these demands by instituting the same rationalization procedures that characterize the fast-food industry [48, p. 152]. He foresees that, at McUniversities, "rules, regulations, system- wide syllabuses and constraints of all types will abound.... Efforts will be made to script 'professors' (like counter people) . . . through the use of uniform lectures and ancillary materials," with emphasis placed on 'reproducing existing knowledge [rather] than producing new knowledge" [48, p. 158]. Quinn has identified the rationalization procedures of efficiency, predictability, calculability, and control specifically within academic li- braries at the end of the twentieth century. Arguing that the concept of predictability is relevant to the collection development aids currently used by these institutions, he notes that "the collection development process has become more and more standardized, resulting in collec- tion content varying less from one library or type of library to another" [46, p. 252]. At the same time, efficiency plays a role in the McDonaldi- zation of libraries because, "rather than attempting to amass vast col- lections of books and journals, the libraries are relying more on ILL and document delivery services to supply resources on an as-needed basis" [46, p. 251]. Yet, as library collections become more homoge- nized, resources and procedures such as interlibrary loan (ILL) will do little to bring new and varied materials to the user. Collection develop- ment librarians who rely primarily on the PLC for selection decisions are in danger of succumbing to this McDonaldization phenomenon. By unhesitatingly accepting PLC recommendations and thinking that adherence to such recommendations ensures an adequate collection on any given topic, librarians are not only complicit in perpetuating a homogenized collection but also of not examining closely whether a purported "best of" list has significant lacunae. Conclusion Collection development tools such as the PLC have the potential to catalyze the McDonaldization not only of public libraries but also of small undergraduate libraries. Although a valuable resource, the PLC is essentially a checklist whose use (or overuse) can result in the homog- enization of library collections-an effect not unlike Ritzer's McUni-
THE POLITICS OF STANDARD SELECTION GUIDES 335 versity scenario, where emphasis is placed on "reproducing existing knowledge [rather] than producing new knowledge" [48, p. 158]. Fur- thermore, the critiques of the PLC presented in this study also indicate the potential for creating standardized collections of "best books" that do not meet the criteria for "best." Accordingly, greater emphasis needs to be placed on the evaluation of such collection development tools, including the various factors that inform both their creation and use. Collection development librarians who are purchasing books for specific subject areas should pay more attention to the types of prob- lems present in the PLC that have been identified here. Across a broad range of twenty-three subject areas, the PLC frequently makes recom- mendations that have an imbalance of perspectives (for example, miss- ing theoretical perspectives, overemphasis of a particular facet or the- ory within a field, missing voices), lack authority, do not have a close match between recommended title and topic area, do not provide a comprehensive framework for the subject area in question, and are problematic in terms of their usability (for example, lack of balance between scholarly and popular titles, datedness, and format). An aware- ness of such shortcomings in standard collection development tools will help librarians to understand that the process of collection devel- opment and evaluation is an intellectual exercise demanding time, ex- tensive subject knowledge, and critical analytical skills-that collection development is not merely a matter of adhering to a recommended checklist.
