A vx Despised " "Semi-Profession" Perceptions of Curricular Content Relating to Gender and Social Issues Among 1993 MUS/MLS Graduates James V. Carmichael, Jr., and Marilyn L. Shontz In the spring of 1994, the authors surveyed 793 male and female 1993 masters of library and information studies graduates, U.S. and Canadian, concerning social responsibili- ties and gender issues, and the treatment that these subjects received in their master's- degree programs. Extensive personal data were also solicited, including the respon- dents' self-identified political orientation, sexual orientation, marital status, educational background, and job history. The response rate was 58 percent. Quantita- tive data and voluminous open-ended comments received suggest that librarians and library education are less progressive than commonly depicted in the professional press; that some programs do not even discuss women's issues in their courses; and that socially nonreactionary female graduates are eager to learn more about these and related issues, not only because it will benefit them personally, but also because the majority of library clients are female. Historically, women in the traditionally "feminized" professions of nursing, teaching, social work, and librarianship have experienced displacement by males in terms of prestige, status, and pay.1 At different periods, women have constituted approximately 70 to 98 per- cent of the work force in these profes- sions, yet research consistently indicates that vertical stratification, task segregation, and lower pay and prestige accrue to women in these fields. Moreover, the professions associ- ated with women are stigmatized by a negative feminine stereotype, by which the problems of low occupational status and prestige are attributed to the pres- ence of large numbers of female profes- sionals. It should be noted that the accredited master's degree has been the accepted professional credential since 1948, and library and informa- tion studies are therefore conducted almost exclusively at the graduate level. Since 1970, the American Library Association (ALA) has adopted several initiatives meant to combat sexism in the profession. During the Equal Rights Amendment initiative, for example, ALA ceased meeting in cities or states which did not endorse amendment rati- fication. Also, the Committee on the Status of Women has regularly moni- tored publications, image concerns, pay, and status levels among librarians. Most importantly, ALA has sponsored numerous studies and publications in- 98 Volume 38, Number 2

In spite of these enterprises, statistics con- tinue to indicate that female librarians earn less, hold fewer administrative po- sitions, and experience more sexism in library school, at conferences, and in the workplace than do their male coun- terparts. Why has sexism in a profession numerically dominated by women per- sisted? At least one theory would hold that female and/or male recruits to the profession are not receiving equal and adequate information about gender is- sues in the workplace in their profes- sional programs. To test this thesis, in spring 1994 the authors surveyed 793 male and fe- male masters of library and information studies (MLIS) graduates, U.S. and Ca- nadian, concerning social responsibili- ties and gender issues. In an attempt to survey the most recent graduates and to reduce problems of under-sampling as a result of noncurrent addresses, the population chosen for this study was all 1993 calendar-year master's- degree graduates of library and information studies programs accredited by the American Library Association's Com- mittee on Accreditation (COA). A strati- fied proportional sample of 20 percent of the graduates of each program was randomly selected from all programs which are currently accepting new stu- dents. Using the 1993 statistics of the Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE) [57, pp. 120-26] as an approximation of the gen- der ratio of MLIS/MLS graduates, the final sample was to consist of approxi- mately 206 men and 784 women. Questionnaires (see appendix) were mailed directly from those pro- grams whose interpretation of campus, state, and province privacy laws pro- hibited them from supplying the names of graduates to the researchers. Fifteen programs chose not to participate, which resulted in underrepresentation of western programs in particular. Schools that chose to distribute ques- tionnaires were given explicit instruc- tions on the selection of graduates; each school was assigned an alphabetic letter with which to begin selection of 20 per- cent of 1993 graduates. Where re- searchers were provided lists of names by the programs, questionnaires were mailed out using the last known ad- dress. The total number of question- naires mailed out to graduates of the forty-two MLIS/MLS programs which participated was 793. Of 793 questionnaires mailed out, 465 usable responses were received (58.64 percent). Thirty-seven question- naires were returned because the ad- dressee had moved with no forwarding address, and 291 persons did not return questionnaires at all. Only those ques- tionnaires accompanied by completed personal data sheets were considered usable, as one of the study's aims was to relate personal factors with expressed attitudes in response to statements on the questionnaire. Specifically, graduates were asked to agree or disagree with thirty-one statements reflecting attitudes toward Spring 1997
100 Journal of Education for Library and Information Science women's issues, social responsibilities "mandates" (e.g., political correctness), and gay and lesbian issues, and also to assess the treatment that these subjects received in their master's-degree pro- grams. Extensive personal data were also solicited, including the respon- dents' self-identified social orientation, sexual orientation, marital status, edu- cational background, and job history. Responses were received from 502 graduates (63.3 percent of the sample); usable responses numbered 465 (58.6 percent). Frequencies, percentages, and means were calculated for items. Differ- ences between means using analysis of variance (ANOVA) were examined us- ing the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) at the probability level p < .05. The demographic factors used for comparison were sex, sexual orien- tation, and social orientation. The pre- sent report covers comparisons by sex.2 Demographic Profile Demographic data confirm the histori- cal profile of library and information studies professionals. The resulting sample gender ratio (76.3 percent fe- male, 23.4 percent male) approximates that reported by the MLIS programs in their annual reports to the Association for Library and Information Science Education (77.3 percent female, 22.7 percent male). The largest portion of the sample (31.6 percent) was between twenty-one and twenty-nine years of age, and the majority of graduates, both male and female, were born after 1954, and were therefore either unborn or children when the social revolution of the 1960s flowered. The majority of males (84.4 percent) and females (89.1 percent) were white, with proportion- ately more male than female repre- sentation in minority groups (see table 1). There were only slight differences between the proportions of males (50.9 percent) and females (52.2 percent) who chose to describe their social orienta- tion as "liberal" or "radical liberal," or between the parallel conservative cate- gories (13.9 percent male, 10.3 percent female). As for sexual orientation, a slightly greater proportion of males (13.9 percent) than females (8.1 per- cent) indicated lesbigay (i.e., either gay, lesbian, or bisexual) status. Employment and Educational Profile Over a fourth (26.2 percent) of graduates were engaged in some form of library reference work, with an additional 2.2 percent employed in other public serv- ice work such as interlibrary loan. Of the remaining position functions, only 6.7 percent were in cataloging, with an additional 1.9 percent in other kinds of technical services work; 1.1 percent were engaged in acquisitions work; and 0.9 percent were employed as collec- tion managers. Other respondents (20.8 percent) defined their positions by cli- entele served (10.1 percent SLM spe- cialist, 5.8 percent youth services, 4.9 percent adult services). Over 10 percent of graduates (10.1 percent) were en- gaged in specialized work that cannot be classified easily by function, such as systems work, state library liaison work, or combined assignments, while 4.1 percent were employed in some ad- ministrative capacity such as depart- ment head, unit supervisor, or library director. Twenty-six percent failed to indicate any kind of position function. More men (9 percent) than women (4.5 percent) were engaged in some kind of administrative work, though these in- dividuals account for only 4.1 percent of the total sample. While no disparities by sex were found in the proportions of men and women working in technical Volume 38, Number 2

102 Journal of Education for Library and Information Science services, a greater proportion of men (46.2 percent) than women (32.5 per- cent) selected reference work. Perhaps, inevitably, more women (25.6 percent) than men (6.4 percent) are school media specialists or youth services librarians. Possible reasons for these occupational choices have been offered elsewhere.3 The disciplinary backgrounds of this sample, as indicated by under- graduate, second master's, and doctoral degrees, confirmed previous findings about the educational background of MLIS students (see table 2). Only eleven individuals had obtained a doctorate, while twenty-eight subjects had earned other degrees (associate degree or law degree, for example). The majority of graduates obtained their undergraduate degrees in the humanities or social sci- ences, according to the government classification of these instructional ar- eas;4 the largest groups represented were letters (21.6 percent), social sci- ence (20.9 percent), education (13.9 percent), performing arts (9.3 percent), communications, and psychology (4.6 percent each). It is interesting to note those fields in which only women majored (area ethnic studies, allied health, health sci- ence, home economics, and parks rec- reation), and those in which only men obtained undergraduate degrees (agri- culture, architecture). More men (31.4 percent) than women (17.4 percent) earned undergraduate degrees in the so- cial sciences, though the difference in the proportion of men and women who earn degrees in letters (18.1 and 22.7 percent, respectively) was negligible. There was only a slight difference in the proportion of male and female educa- tion majors (10.5 versus 14.7 percent), although at the master's level, only 23.5 percent of males earned an education degree as compared to 39.7 percent of females. For those earning a master's degree, the fields of education, social science, performing arts, and letters accounted for the greatest number of degrees, and for those earning a second master's degree, only marketing and philosophy/ religion were new to the list. Males held exclusive claim to master's degrees in di- vinity; likewise only females earned mas- ter's degrees in interdisciplinary studies (which includes women's studies). While no general conclusions can be made based on the small numbers obtained, it is worth noting other fields in which fe- males rather than males obtained master's degrees (health sciences, home econom- ics, law, and archival science) and those in which only males chose to specialize (area ethnic studies, business manage- ment, communications, and computer and information science). Social Responsibilities, Professionalism, and "Political Correctness" Seven questionnaire items tested atti- tudes about professionalism as it relates to social responsibilities, personal awareness of social issues, social activ- ism as an exercise of First Amendment rights, and library collections as a mir- ror of society. Four items addressed " di versity "/special interest attitudes and attitudes toward "political correct- ness" (see table 3). Only a minority of graduates strongly agreed or agreed that profes- sionals should remain aloof from social issues (12 percent), while nearly two- thirds (64.6 percent) disagreed or strongly disagreed. Slightly over a fifth (22.3 percent) agreed that library and information professionals had ade- quately addressed social issues, while 41.1 percent both agreed and disagreed, implying perhaps that the profession had addressed certain issues ade- quately, and others, less so.

104 Journal of Education for Library and Information Science no statistically significant differences in responses to these items by sex. Not quite half of the respondents unequivo- cally agreed that the library profession is more progressive than other profes- sions, with no statistically significant differences in responses by sex, while over 61 percent selected "strongly agree" or "agree" to describe their atti- tudes toward the statement that librar- ies and librarians have a responsibility to address social issues, again with no significant differences by sex. Over half of both males and females agreed with a statement which championed as in- clusive a collection as possible. The terms "multiculturalism" and "political correctness," which have re- ceived a great deal of media attention in the past decade, especially in the pages of academe's The Chronicle of Higher Education, drew a mixed reaction from the respondents. Over half (52.5 per- cent) agreed that "political correctness" was a danger to freedom of speech. Only 22.6 percent agreed that a philosophy of "political correctness" was essential for the protection of minority rights, and only 22.4 percent unequivocally agreed that the dangers of a philosophy of "po- litical correctness" were exaggerated by the media. It is clear that the acronym "p.c." signified a degree of censorship to some 1993 graduates. While there are no significant differences by sex in re- sponses received to social responsibili- ties items generally, more men than women agreed that "political correct- ness" was a danger to freedom of speech (p = .0048), perhaps because men's is- sues have not been addressed by the profession, and because more men asso- ciate "p.c." at least in part with women's issues. Not quite half (48.8 percent) of re- spondents disclaimed the statement that there are "too many" minority groups and interest groups competing for attention in society. It is evident from these responses that 1993 gradu- ates, on the whole, were sensitive to the struggles and claims of various minority groups. On the other hand, sixteen qualitative comments which accompa- nied these items echoed sentiments voiced in editorial columns of Ameri- can Libraries over the past several years to the effect that professionalism should exist apart from social issues,5 and that it is the duty of librarians to build col- lections representative of all points of view rather than to address particular social issues directly. These comments seemed to call for a more limited, pas- sive, and neutral social stance, purely non judgmental rather than proactive. Women's Issues and Legal Redress Five items reflected attitudes toward women's issues in the profession and in society. Three of the items related to Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Ac- tion (EO/AA) legislation which applies to racial and ethnic minorities as well as women, while the other two items covered treatment of women's issues in library literature and the response of the profession to women's issues generally. Only 9.1 percent of the subjects agreed or strongly agreed that EO/AA legisla- tion has had a negative effect on the profession, although only 31.8 percent agreed or strongly agreed that it has had a positive effect on the profession. Inter- estingly, only 11.9 percent agreed or strongly agreed that EO/AA has had no discernible effect on the profession, while the remaining 41.2 percent had ambiguous feelings reflected by their choice of the "neither agree nor dis- agree" category. A minority (6.5 percent) of the re- spondents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that women's issues had received too much attention in li- Volume 38, Number 2
Perceptions of Curricular Content 1 05 brary literature, yet only 27.3 percent agreed that the library profession has not adequately addressed women's is- sues. It may well be that some graduates perceived a gap between library litera- ture and library practice, or that they may not yet be personally aware of work situations that are inequitable for women. As might be expected, there were statistically significant differences in the way in which women and men ap- proach items relating to women's issues in society and the profession. Men were more likely to agree that EO/AA legis- lation has had a negative effect on the profession (p = .0031) and more likely to disagree that it has had a positive effect (p = .0007). Women were more likely to agree that women's issues have not been adequately addressed by the profession (p = .0174), and less likely to believe that they had re- ceived too much attention in library literature (p = .0000). Lesbigay Issues in the Profession Six items called for responses to state- ments reflecting attitudes about les- bigays in the profession. Four of these related to lesbigay library materials, and library policies regarding lesbigay materials. Two other items related to the perception of the number of lesbigays in the profession, and the personal feel- ings of respondents toward lesbigay is- sues and literature. Less than a fifth of respondents (18.5 percent) agreed or strongly agreed that there was a higher percentage of lesbigays in the profession than in soci- ety at large, and 40.8 percent disagreed or strongly disagreed with this state- ment. This reflected some knowledge on the part of respondents, since to date there is no empirical evidence which would support the notion that there is a larger proportion of lesbigays in the li- brary profession than in other profes- sions, or than in the general population. Men were more likely than women to concede that there are more lesbigays in the profession than in society at large (p = .0151), a result, perhaps, of male sensitivity to the gay stereotype. Women were more likely than men to believe that lesbigay issues should be addressed through comprehensive col- lection development (p = .0042), and were more likely to advocate resistance to sequestering lesbigay materials either to bypass strong antigay sentiment in the community (p = .0474), or to prevent theft and defacement (p = .0121). Five statements addressed the cov- erage of lesbigay issues by library me- dia. Only 11.6 percent of graduates agreed or strongly agreed that library media distorted lesbigay issues, while 41 percent disagreed or strongly dis- agreed. Only 13 percent unequivocally agreed that library media don't pay enough attention to lesbigay issues, and 17 percent unequivocally agreed that library media pay too much attention to them. Given the data presented, the re- maining 70 percent presumably feel that the library media's treatment of les- bigay issues is appropriate. Women were less likely than men to agree with the premise that the library media dis- tort lesbigay issues (p = .0195). The MUS Curriculum Six items referred to the coverage of social responsibilities generally and coverage of multiculturalism, women's issues, and lesbigay issues in the curric- ula of MLIS programs (see table 4). Over half of the respondents (61.3 percent) agreed or strongly agreed that their MLIS education introduced them to the concept of the social responsibility of librarians, and only 21.7 percent dis- Spring 1997

Perceptions of Curricular Content 1 09 agreed or strongly disagreed. This find- ing would seem to underscore the need for coverage of these issues in MLIS curricula, although it should be tem- pered with the knowledge that not all social responsibilities issues receive equal coverage at the present time. For example, 54.9 percent unequivocally agreed that multicultural diversity had received some special emphasis in the curriculum, while only 25.8 percent agreed that women's issues had re- ceived similar emphasis. On the other hand, only 9 percent agreed that women's issues were "not discussed at all" in the item that asked respondents to rate coverage of these issues in spe- cific courses. More men than women were likely to respond that women's issues had received some special em- phasis in the curriculum (p = .0012). Coverage of lesbigay issues in MLIS/MLS curricula is even more sparse than that for women's or mul- ticultural issues, according to the re- sponses received. Only a quarter of all respondents (26 percent) learned about lesbigay issues in foundations courses, and a quarter learned about them in reference courses (25 percent). Other courses mentioned were type of library (19.9 percent), diversity (16.6 percent), research methods (8.2 percent), techni- cal services (5.4 percent), collection management (5.2 percent), and eth- ics/intellectual freedom courses (1.2 per- cent). Two respondents indicated that there was coverage of these issues only because their professor was gay, and the findings would seem to indicate that some faculty and programs are more con- sistent in their emphasis on coverage of lesbigay issues, since 52.2 percent of re- spondents either failed to indicate any coverage of lesbigay issues, or indicated that it was not discussed at all. Qualitative Comments While a remarkable degree of consensus exists between male and female gradu- ates on social issues generally, and to some degree on women's issues, numer- ous qualitative comments emphasize the importance of individual experi- ence in shaping respondents' percep- tions. One female, for example, commented that she did not recall the national association journal [American Libraries) "focusing on women's issues much at all," while another pointed to the lack of substantive studies and cur- ricular emphasis: "I really have no idea what effect Equal Opportunity /Equal Opportunity Act has had on the library profession." One woman called for a hiatus on discussion of lesbigay issues in favor of women's issues: "Let's work on breaking the glass ceiling." Her sen- timents were echoed by another, who called for more respect for work with children. Other female respondents pointed to other areas that were dis- counted in library literature - work with the homeless, victims of child abuse, and environmental concerns. Al- though there were no clear delineations by sex on expressed support for social activism versus professional neutrality, it is clear that some members of both sexes felt that the profession should be more proactive in dealing with social problems. Conclusions The 1993 graduates are typically com- mitted to the social responsibilities mandate: they believe that the profes- sion should not remain aloof from so- cial issues and that the library has the responsibility to address social issues Spring 1997

Perceptions of Curricular Content 1 1 1 in collection policy and practices and in service rendered to clientele. More- over, they are generally supportive of minority concerns within the profes- sion, with women showing an even more heightened social awareness than men of the positive aspects of activism. Beyond general support for minority concerns, however, the ma- jority of 1993 graduates seem ambigu- ous about the forms of redress and activism that are appropriate to a pro- fessional setting. Perhaps the most interesting find- ing of the survey was that social orien- tation, rather than sex or sexual orientation, accounts for the greatest number of statistically significant dif- ferences in responses received (twenty- two items). Sex and sexual orientation produce such differences on only eleven items each, half the number gen- erated by self-selected and emotionally "loaded" labels of radical liberal, lib- eral, moderate, conservative, and radi- cal conservative. Thus, the responses generated by the present survey would seem to suggest that 1993 graduates are more influenced by their sociopolitical orientation to social issues than their own minority status. In the case of the female respondents to this survey, femi- nist consciousness of workplace inequi- ties is only slightly higher than that of their male colleagues. Women's issues rank fifth among the six categories of issues in the number of statistically sig- nificant differences in responses re- ceived. Whether this finding indicates that feminist consciousness has evolved to a more inclusive state, whether it is underdeveloped in library and information studies programs, or whether other social problems simply seem more pressing in the current cli- mate, cannot be determined from the present survey, but should be investi- gated in future studies. Gender issues and multicultural di- versity have not received consistent at- tention in MLIS curricula, although the coverage of such issues in the mainstream media has been intense, especially in the past several years. While many studies have addressed workplace equity, there is little evidence that males and females receive adequate information about how gender roles operate in society, and how they affect librarianship - one of the most prominent "feminized" fields - throughout their course work. The sug- gestion received from one graduate, for a study of the impact of EO/AA pro- grams in the library field, certainly pre- sents one way to approach the problem in future studies. Quantitative data and voluminous open-ended comments received sug- gested that graduates of library educa- tion programs perceive themselves to be progressive, albeit somewhat less pro- gressive than the stereotypical left-wing liberal occasionally evoked in the pro- fessional press. Many of them recall that their library education programs did not even include women's issues or lesbigay issues in their curricula, and some have encountered problems relat- ing to these concerns in their workplace environments. Some socially nonreac- tionary female graduates are eager to learn more about these and related is- sues, not only because it will benefit them personally, but also because the majority of library clients are female. Clearly, some consensus exists among 1993 graduates that they would have liked to learn more about these issues in their library education. From the results of this survey, then, it would seem that ALISE might take the initiative in sup- porting general discussion of curricular and ideological emphasis outside the special interest group sessions at their annual meetings. Programs which do discuss these issues ought to incorpo- rate them into general course content (e.g., sexual harassment and discrimina- Spring 1997
1 1 2 Journal of Education for Library and Information Science tion in administration/management- type courses) rather than make them solely the focus of occasional work- shops. The data would also seem to jus- tify more exhaustive cross-disciplinary studies in the feminized professions of the ideological identity of the current generation of professional novices, a thorough examination of these curric- ula, and determination of the administra- tive status of women's professions on campuses which support their programs. Most importantly, however, the re- sults of this study indicate that while there are some differences by sex in the perceived emphasis placed upon women's issues in MLIS curricula, and the perceived effects of EO/AA legisla- tion on the work environment, consensus exists between male and female 1993 MLIS graduates on nearly two-thirds (twenty out of thirty-one) of these social issues items. Thus, continuing inequities in the field may not be so much related to the content of MLIS curricula or profes- sional ideology as they are to the larger workplace structures - host govern- ments, universities, or school systems - where the moderately "liberal" service orientation of librarianship is subsumed by local political, social, and bureaucratic realities.
