Library and Information Science Students' Feedback in an Online Course Noa Aharony Department of Information Science, Bar-llan University, Ramat Gan, Israel 52900. Email: aharonnl@mail.biu.ac.il The aim of the current research is to analyze the content of the messages expressed by LIS students in online courses as feedback, with the purpose of understanding the main themes being articulated by LIS university and college students, and examining whether there is a difference between the themes of LIS university students and those of LIS college students as revealed in their feedback. The paper provides a quantitative and a qualitative content analysis of feedbacks assigned to an online course taught in Israel. Findings show that the major theme expressed in LIS student feedback is their personal impression of their online experience, followed by the reflection category and the collaboration one. The smallest categories focus on course material and on course management. Furthermore, findings present that LIS university students are more satis- fied with their online learning experience and that LIS university students discuss and express more reflective, analytic meta-cognitive aspects of the learning process than their LIS college counterparts. Keywords: LIS education, students' feedback, online course, distance education, e-learning, Israel Introduction Distance distance education, learning, online also known learning, as distance learning, online learning, e-learning and blended learning, offers instructors and students a flexible learn- ing environment in terms of location and time. Various educational institutions offer more and more online courses. In distance education settings, students and instructors are usually separated by dis- tance and time (Walker, 2005; Ypsilandis, 2002). Distance education can be used in supported learning, blended learning and entirely online learning (Pearson & Trini- dad, 2005). Mark (1990) suggests a typol- ogy that depends on the form of institution offering the service: (1) Distance Learning Program; (2) Distance Learning Unit; (3) Distance Learning Institution; and (4) Dis- tance Learning Consortia. Various general studies have been con- ducted so far, examining different factors influencing online learning, such as vari- ous kinds of interaction, student satisfac- tion, collaboration, and course evaluation. Only a few studies have been carried out in the field of online learning and LIS, and no study so far has examined LIS student feedback in online courses. The current research explores LIS student feedback in online courses. The term feedback here refers to students' answers to instructors' open questions at the end of the course, and not teachers' feedback to students dur- ing the online learning process. The cur- rent study seeks to delve into the online learning process by analyzing the content of the feedback expressed by LIS students, thus revealing the different themes that de- scribe their experience in online courses. The primary research questions are: 1 . What are the main themes revealed as LIS students express their experience in online courses? 2. Is there a difference between the themes of LIS university students and J. of Education for Library and Information Science, Vol. 52, No. A - (Fall) October 201 1 ISSN: 0748-5786 Â© 201 1 Association for Library and Information Science Education 305
306 JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE those of LIS college students as re- vealed in their feedback? The research findings are important for LIS educators as they may better under- stand the various issues that occupy online students, thus being able to improve their online courses. The findings may help them to teach and plan their courses dif- ferently, being aware of online students' needs and difficulties. Literature Review Distance Education Distance education in general has gen- erated a great deal of research (Chambers, 2006; Gibson, 1998; Hagel & Shaw, 2006; Holmberg, 1986; Hong, Ridzuan & Kuek, 2003; Keegan, 1990; Lee, Cho, Gay, Da- vidson, & Ingraffea, 2003; Liao, 2006; Moore, 1977; Muilenburg & Berge, 2005; White, 2005). Various studies have fo- cused on the advantages of online learning, emphasizing in particular the convenience and flexibility offered by the "anytime, anywhere" concept (Jiang, 1998; Jiang & Ting, 2000; Matthews, 1999; Rourke, Anderson, Garrison, & Archer, 1999; Si- monson, Smaldino, Albright, & Zvacek, 2000). The model of distance education al- lows students to reflect upon materials be- fore responding and to work at their own pace (Matthews, 1999; Simonson et al., 2000). Since students are able to conceal their race, any disability and their appear- ance, equal ground is provided for all (Si- monson et al., 2000). Distance education suggests a student-centered approach in which the instructor plays the role of facil- itator and students engage in peer learning (Maor, 2003; Mitchell, Chen, & Macredie, 2005). Regarding its disadvantages, some researchers claim that online learning is not as effective as traditional learning because it lacks face-to-face interaction (Bullen, 1998; Ward & Newlands 1998). The use of online asynchronous discus- sion forums as a major element of online learning has become increasingly preva- lent (Katz, 2003; Morgan, 2003; Warger, 2003). Teaching through online forums presents a challenge to instructors, whose sole means of contact with students is via forum postings or emails. Instructors are unable to see student body language or reactions, so the interaction in the online forum plays an essential role in this par- ticular learning environment. Interactions in Asynchronous Online Discussion Boards Interactivity, a chief characteristic of online learning, can potentially have great impact on learning (Harasim, 1989). Various studies have shown that students prefer asynchronous online discussion to synchronous discussion as it provides op- portunities to offer thoughtful responses to questions and to the opinions and ideas of others (Bhattacharaya, 1999; Davidson- Shivers, Tanner, & Muhlenberg, 2000). Moore and Kearsley (1996) analyzed three types of interactions in distance edu- cation: student-content, student-instruc- tor, and student-student interactions. Sev- eral studies examined the importance of these interactions as a key element for suc- cessful student outcomes and satisfaction (Gao, 2001; Garrison & Cleveland-Innes, 2005; La Pointe & Gunawarndena, 2004). Instructor feedback has also been recog- nized as critical to the learning process in many studies (Berge, 1995; Ertmer et al., 2007; Ko & Rossen, 2001; Moore, 2002; Russo & Campbell, 2004; Salmon, 2000; Salmon & Giles, 1997; Zhang, Gao, Ring, & Zhang, 2007). Online instructors often grapple with the question of how much and in what way to intervene in student discussions in order to aid learning. The instructor's role can vary from being "the sage on stage" to the "guide on the side" or "the ghost in the wings" (Mazzolini & Maddison, 2003). Thoughtftil comments on student posts seem to stimulate further discussion, and also motivate students to delve deeper and further into the mate-
Library and Information Science Students ' Feedback in an Online Course 307 rial. Kearsley (2000) argues that frequent instructor participation encourages stu- dent participation in the discussion. Con- versely, Mazzolini and Maddison (2007) claim that sometimes instructor partici- pation is overdone, and that instructors should maintain a balance between too little and too much participation. Instruc- tors should not respond to every student post, but should determine the appropriate moment to jump in, make a comment, ask a question or redirect the discussion. Other researchers claim that too much instructor participation may cause an unnecessary degree of reliance (Levitch & Milheim, 2003; Paloff & Pratt, 2001). Although Moore's typology of interac- tions is the most common discussed, other classification systems have also been used. Researchers have discussed academic in- teractions related to the material (Berge, 1995; Gilbert & Moore, 1998; Henri, 1991; Moore & Kearsley, 1996); social interactions between the learner and in- structor or amongst the learners (Berge, 1995; Gilbert & Moore, 1998; Henri, 1991); and technical interactions unrelated to the learning material (Henri, 1991 ; Hill- man, Willis, & Gunawardena, 1994). Jung (2001) proposes three different kinds of interactions: academic, collaborative, and interpersonal. In sum, interaction plays a major and significant role in the distance education context. Students' Satisfaction in Online Courses Assessing student satisfaction can play a major role in evaluating the effectiveness of distance learning. An analysis of 24 ar- ticles reporting student satisfaction with distance education indicates that there is no statistically significant difference be- tween distance education and traditional education in terms of student satisfaction levels (Allen, Bourhis, Burrell, & Mabry, 2002). These findings may imply that stu- dents perceive distance education to be as satisfactory as other traditional formats of learning. Several studies have been conducted to identify factors influencing student satis- faction in online courses. Sahin (2007) dis- covered that personal relevance, instruc- tor support, active learning and authentic learning all affected student satisfaction. In another study, Sahin and Shelley (2008) note that computer knowledge and percep- tions, regarding, for example, the useful- ness and flexibility of distance education, are predictors of student satisfaction. Es- pasa and Meneses (2009) assert that the presence of feedback in an online course is associated with high higher levels of sat- isfaction. Bolliger and Martindale (2004) claim that instructor variables related to communication, feedback, preparation, content knowledge, teaching methods, en- couragement, accessibility and profession- alism are the most important factors influ- encing satisfaction. Similar results were reported by Leong, Ho, and Saromines- Ganne (2002), who suggest that student satisfaction was influenced by instructor, system-wide technology, workload/dif- ficulty and interaction. Swan (2001) pro- poses that clarity of design, interaction with instructors, and advisory discussion among course participants influenced stu- dent satisfaction. Chang and Smith (2008) conclude that student-instructor inter- action, student-student interaction, and student-content interaction, along with student perceptions of Web CT features and student gender, were all predictors of course satisfaction. Gaddis, Napierkowsk, Guzman and Muth, (2000) and Kitchen and McDougall (1998) maintain that gen- erally online students are dissatisfied with the following factors: (a) unclear expecta- tions from instructors, (b) tight timeline, (c) workload, (d) poor software interface, (e) slow access, and (f) no synchronous communication. Regarding the association between so- cial presence and student satisfaction with online courses, there have been mixed results. Several studies report a positive association in online discussion forums between social presence and satisfaction
308 JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE (Gunawardena, Lowe, & Anderson, 1997; Richardson & Swan, 2003; Swan & Shih, 2005). Wise, Chang, Duffy, and Del Valle (2004), however, claim that although so- cial presence increased the volume of stu- dent input and influenced their perception of the instructor, it had no effect on student satisfaction. Collaborative teaming Collaborative learning is a form of learner-learner interaction (So & Brush, 2008), considered an effective tool for learning in traditional and distance edu- cation (Bernard, Rubalcava, & St-Pierre, 2000). Harasim, Hiltz, Teles, and Murray (1995) indicate that online collaborative learning is a process in which two or more people work together to create meaning, explore a topic, or improve skills. Kirsch- ner (2001) asserts that collaborative learn- ing is an active process, in which teachers and pupils share experiences; the teacher is a facilitator; and students learn in small groups, reflect on their assumptions and are responsible for their learning. Several researchers have mentioned the benefits of students playing an active role in learning, such as fostering curiosity and motivation and developing lifelong learning skills (Goldman, Mayfield-Stewart, Bateman, & Pellegrino, 1998; Jarvela, Hakkarainen, Lehtinen, & Lipponen, 2001; Krajcik, Blumenfeld, Marx, & Soloway, 2000; Minstrell 2000). Aharony (2009b) adds that the use of a wiki in LIS class reflects both collaboration among the students and use of deep levels of cognition. LIS Distance Education This section refers to research in the field of LIS distance education. Several studies have addressed the issue of stu- dents' satisfaction in online learning. Mon- tague and Pluzhenskaia (2007) report that students are generally satisfied with their online education experience; however, they complain about lack of course orga- nization and interaction. Burnett, Bonnici, Mixsa and Kim (2007), focused on inter- action in online education and identified and analyzed the dimensions of interac- tion that contribute to LIS online students' satisfaction. They found out that the less frequent the interaction is, the less satis- fied LIS students are, and the higher the intensity of interaction and the topicality of interaction, the more likely LIS students will express satisfaction with the course. Bunn (2004) tried to find out which factors enable LIS master's students to persist in their distance program, claiming that sup- port, managing of the workload, and per- sonal factors are the key factors that help students continue their online learning. Other researchers have pointed to other aspects of online learning. Yukawa (2010) investigated the use of a community of practice (COP) model for blended learn- ing in LIS graduate courses, finding that the online tools support online communi- cation and learning and that LIS students appreciate the value of collaboration. Hall- Ellis (2005) compared between tradition- al-LIS students and virtual-LIS students who took a beginning cataloging class. Her findings suggest that both classes per- form at a similar level. Kazmer (2007), who dealt with the issue of online LIS stu- dents' experience with and without a resi- dency, provides insights into the differ- ences between the two groups, indicating that students without a residency have less sense of community, find group work less successful, and build fewer friendships among their colleagues, although they re- ceive support from local colleagues. Luo and Kemp (2008) explored how the Sec- ond Life environment can be used in LIS education. Their findings indicate that LIS educators are interested in using Second Life in areas like reference, library ser- vices for young children and adults, and library history. Further studies have approached learn- ing styles and communication styles in online LIS students. Brown-Syed, Adkins, and Tsai (2005) find that there was no sig-
Library and Information Science Students 'Feedback in an Online Course 309 nificant difference between the learning styles of online and traditional LIS stu- dents. Du (2004) examined the effects of learning styles and computer competency on students' satisfaction in LIS distance courses and asserts that when students dif- fer with regard to computer competency, there is a difference among learning styles with respect to student satisfaction level. Yukawa (2007) reports a case study that examined the learning process of two LIS graduate students in an online action re- search course, claiming that the main fac- tors that influence online communication styles are complex and multidimensional. Method Research Design The aim of the current research is to analyze LIS student feedback in online courses as expressed by the content of their messages, with the purpose of understand- ing the main themes being articulated by LIS university and college students. The researcher conducted a thorough quanti- tative and a qualitative content analysis. According to Neuendorf (2002), content analysis summarizes quantitative analy- sis of messages. It is a common method for investigating written documents such as Web pages (Babbie & Mouton, 2001). Krippendorff (1980) presented the advan- tages of content analysis: it is unobtru- sive, accepts unstructured material, and is context sensitive. It can process symbolic forms and cope with large amounts of data. The goal of content analysis is to examine message characteristics in an objective manner by applying consistent criteria rig- orously (Neuendorf, 2002). The messages analyzed represent how the writer "natu- rally presents or projects itself to its nor- mal audience, rather than to a researcher" (Kabanoff, 1996). Units of Analysis Each feedback was divided into units of meaning, which comprise the units of analysis. A unit of meaning can be a phrase, a sentence, or several sentences conveying one message. The term was coined by Henri (1991), who argued that computer-mediated communication mes- sages have more than one unit of meaning, and that one should define its own relevant unit of meaning. Procedure The feedbacks were gathered from un- dergraduate second-year LIS students who took the online course "Educational Infor- mation Science and Librarianship" in the 2009 academic year in Israel. The students belong to two LIS departments in two insti- tutions: an academic college with a profes- sional school for Information Science (32 students), and a university (33 students). In the professional school for Information Science, students study a profession and not a theoretical discipline; they earn a practical degree and are able to work upon graduation. At the university, students complete and receive their first academic degree, not a professional certificate. The same professor conveyed the same online course in these two institutions. Both insti- tutions have a special technological plat- form for online courses: "High-Learning" at the university and "Kessem" at the col- lege. The students and professor met phys- ically once at the beginning of the course, while the rest of the course was delivered over the internet. Students were asked to read professional articles by certain dates, and then to submit six assignments to the forum on fixed dates over the semester. Students were required to read their peers' assignments on the forum and respond by commenting, questioning and adding per- sonal thoughts, an activity facilitating an active and dynamic forum. The professor also read the papers and commented on them in the forum. The feedbacks ana- lyzed in the current study were written in the forum as a response to the instructor's request at the end of the course that stu-
31 0 JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE dents provide feedback reporting and de- scribing their experience. The feedbacks had to be submitted within ten days. Data Analysis The researcher examined the feedbacks and conducted quantitative and qualitative content analysis. This same method has al- ready been used in previous studies (Aha- rony, 2009a, Aharony & Bronstein, 2008). Since the author had no a priori ideas about the major issues presented in the feed- backs, she used an inductive/clustering approach, devising new categories when- ever a feedback did not match any previ- ous category. After creating five major categories, the author generated new sub- categories according to the content of the feedbacks. Each category was assessed by a single classifier and then cross-checked by a second classifier. The final percent- age of agreement for all coding decisions was 90%, suggesting that the coding clas- sification was reliable. The categorization included 3 1 8 units of analysis and resulted in a category scheme for all feedbacks appearing in the sample. The categoriza- tion consists of five major categories, each containing several subcategories. Findings The researcher found 65 feedbacks on the two forums of which 3 1 8 units of analy- sis were analyzed. LIS college students wrote 160 feedback units (50.3 1%) and LIS university students wrote 158 (49.68%). Table 1 presents the five major categories found in the feedbacks in both forums. Table 1 indicates that the largest cat- egory within the two courses is personal impression, followed by reflection, then by collaboration, course materials and course management The personal impression cat- egory includes these subcategories: enjoy- ment, interest, positive experience, nega- tive experience, willingness to take another online course, anxiety, and impressions of first online course. The reflection category consists of these subcategories: meta-analy- sis, process of learning, personal meta-anal- ysis and negative attitude. The collabora- tion category refers to these subcategories: active discussion, different perspectives, interest, positive interaction, enjoyment, collaborative learning, pleasant experience, curiosity, negative attitude, more instruc- tor intervention. The course materials cat- egory is composed of these subcategories: interesting materials, difficulties, structure of materials, up to date material, variety of materials, and encouragement of individual learning. The last category course manage- ment embodies these subcategories: posi- tive feedback and negative criticism. The following section (Tables 2 through 6) presents the breakdown of the large cat- egories into subcategories within each fo- rum separately (university versus college). Table 2 displays the personal impression category breakdown for LIS university students and for LIS college students. Table 2 shows that the three largest sub- categories within LIS university students' personal impression category are enjoy- ment (30.30%), interest (22.95%), and positive experience (24.24%). Other cate- gories are small in size (12% and less). Ta- ble 2 indicates that 22.95% of LIS college Table 1 : Five major Categories of Feedbacks.

Other categories are small in size (12% and less). The following section provides exam- ples for the personal impression category: â¢ Enjoyment: "As a first course I took in online learning, I must admit that I re- ally enjoyed it." "Dear Dr. X: Continue succeeding in such courses. It was a great experience for me." â¢ Interest: "It was a very interesting course. I have never experienced this kind of studying." â¢ Positive Experience: "We have gone a long way and learnt many new things. 1 have personally never experienced this kind of studying before." "It was an interesting experience; I thank you and the other students." â¢ Negative Experience: "Sometimes I felt that I needed the teacher and the discus- sion in class in order to better under- stand the material." â¢ First Online Course: "It was my first online course." â¢ Anxiety: "I felt scared of the subject and of the new way of teaching. I did not know how I would work within the forum." â¢ Willingness to Take another Online Course: "I hope that I'll take another online course that will be managed in the same way." Table 3 presents the reflection category breakdown within LIS university students and LIS college students. Table 3 shows that the three largest categories within LIS university students' reflection category are: meta-analysis (53.84%), process of learning (25%), and personal meta-analysis (15.38%). Other categories are small in size (5% or less).

The following section provides exam- ples for the reflection category: â¢ Meta-Analysis: "The fact that we were asked to hand in the answers and responses to other students' assign- ments to the forum sharpened our way of thinking and contributed much to the discussions." â¢ Process of Learning: "The most impor- tant thing I gained from this course is the sense of awareness to my general process of learning. I suddenly knew how to identity and name different phases of my learning process." â¢ Personal Meta-Analysis: "I have to admit: this course caused me to think differently and caused me to be more involved in my children's education in school." "I really felt part of a learning community." "1 remember the experi- ence I had after the first assignment, in which I expressed a different opinion from the rest. I found myself sitting, waiting for other students' responses and planning how to answer them. I re- ally felt enthusiastic and I can say that I even enjoyed it (a feeling I did not have in other traditional courses)." â¢ Negative Attitude: "When you take an online course, you find it difficult to fol- low all assignments on time. Sometimes you do not see the assignments." Table 4 shows the collaboration cat- egory breakdown within LIS university students and LIS college students. Table 4 indicates that the three largest subcategories within LIS university stu- dents' collaboration category are: active discussion (30.55%) the ability to be ex- posed to different perspectives (22.22%), and interest (16.66%). Other categories are small in size (11% and less). Table 4 reveals that the two largest subcategories within LIS college students' collaboration category are interest and enjoyment (20% each). The following section provides ex- amples for the collaboration category: â¢ Active Discussion: "I had the possibil- ity to respond online, I learnt to 'listen' to my peers and had the feeing that someone really read what I wrote and responded accordingly." "I learnt a lot from my peers' responses and from your answers (the instructor)." â¢ Different Perspectives: "Reading the messages in the forum enabled me to broaden my horizons, as they included new and interesting themes and per- spectives."

Table 5 addresses course material cat- egory breakdown within LIS university students and LIS college students. Table 5 shows that the largest subcat- egories within LIS university students' course materials category are the course material's level of interest (30%), difficul- ties (mainly because of foreign language, 25%), and structure (20%). Other catego- ries are small in size (15% and less). Table 5 indicates that the same subcategories - material's level of interest (32.14%), diffi- culties (1 7.85%) and structure (1 7.85%) - are also the largest subcategories in the course material category within LIS col- lege students. Other categories are small in size (14% and less). The following section provides examples for the course material category: â¢ Interesting Material: "The material was very interesting." â¢ Difficulties: "I found it difficult to read many articles in English (which is a foreign language for the students)." â¢ Structure of Material: "The course ma- terial was logically structured." â¢ Up to Date Material: "The materials were up to date and included recent theories and studies." â¢ Variety of Materials: "There was a wide variety of materials in the course." â¢ Encourages Individual Learning: "I found myself reading more articles in order to better understand the subject." Table 6 shows the course management category breakdown within LIS university students and LIS college students. Table 6 suggests that the largest subcat- egory within the course management cat- egory among LIS university students is the positive feedback of the course (58.82%). Table 6 shows that the largest subcategory within the course management category among LIS college students is the negative criticism of the course (73.33%). The fol- lowing section provides examples for the course management category: â¢ Positive Criticism: "I enjoyed the way
314 JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE the instructor managed the course: She summarized the discussions, responded to each student, and answered the ques- tions quickly." â¢ Negative Criticism: "The instructor's responses to the assignments were short. I expected longer and more de- tailed responses." Discussion and Recommendations This research provides an extensive analysis of LIS student feedback in an online course, an issue thus far underex- plored. LIS student feedback in both en- vironments did not contain only courtesy, social or good manners remarks, but in- cluded content based comments that re- flected deep thoughts, analysis and mean- ing of the learning process. The first research question sought to discover the main themes revealed as LIS students express their experience in on- line courses: the first two largest catego- ries, personal impression and reflection, are similar in size (29.55% and 27.67%). When asked about their online experience, LIS students are keen to discuss it in a different, new learning environment. The second largest issue expressed through LIS student feedback is the reflection categoiy. Reflection plays an important role in learn- ing processes and helps to promote learn- ing performance (Chi, de Leeuw, Chiu, & Lavancher, 1994; Lee& Hutchison, 1998; McNamara, 2004; McNamara, O'Reilly, Best, & Ozuru, 2006). Reflection enables students to think about and analyze their learning process. The LIS online students used meta-cognitive skills to describe their learning process. This finding can be as- sociated with the professional literature that suggests that the distance education environment allows students to reflect on materials before responding (Matthews, 1999; Simonson, Smaldino et al., 2000). LIS educators should be aware of these findings and take advantage of their impli- cations. They may use the online educa- tional platform as a place where they pres- ent deep, interesting topics and problems, hoping that students will turn into active learners, trying to reflect about new issues and to solve problems using meta-cogni- tive skills. The third largest theme reported by LIS online students is collaboration, a major component of distance learning. Palloff and Pratt (1999) assert that in distance education, learning is promoted through sharing ideas and thoughts. LIS students in the current study highlight collabora- tion, emphasizing its significance in the learning process. They claim that the online platform enhances collaborative learning, enabling them to respond to oth- ers and learn from their peers; it also ex- poses them to different perspectives, of which they were not previously aware. These findings confirm the professional literature that suggests that online learn- ing environment facilitates the sharing and creation of knowledge through peer interaction and group learning processes (Resta & Laferriere 2006), and that col- laboration between learners enhances their learning process (Aharony, 2009b; Kreijns, Kirschner, & Jochems, 2003; Pea 1994; Stahl 2006). These findings are also relevant for LIS instructors as they may exploit the online environment for devel- oping collaborative missions that enhance Table 6: Course Management Category Breakdown within LIS University Students and LIS College Students LIS University Students LIS College Students Number Percentages Number Percentages Positive Feedback 1 0 58.82 4 26.66 Negative Criticism 7 41.17 11 73.33

They may plan and present assignments that require collabo- ration among students, thus exposing them to other views, and enabling them to learn from their peers. The smallest categories focus on different aspects of the online course: course material and course man- agement. These issues are important to the students, but they reflect other dimensions in the online environment: LIS students expressed their satisfaction or dissatisfac- tion with the course material and with the course management. These two smallest categories should also be considered by LIS professors, as they reveal the level of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with course materials and management, enabling the professors to try to improve LIS curricu- lum. The first three largest categories deal with main components of distance learn- ing, while the two smaller categories with more technical issues. The second research question sought to discover a difference between the themes of LIS university students and those of LIS college students as revealed in their feed- back. A comparison between LIS univer- sity students and LIS college students in the personal impression category shows that this category was larger within LIS college students than within LIS university students (64.89%, 35.10%, respectively). LIS university students concentrate on en- joyment, interest and positive experience, while LIS college students prefer to dis- cuss their positive and negative experience and the fact that it was their first online course. LIS university students are gener- ally more pleased with the online course, and express their enjoyment and interest, while LIS college students are more skep- tical and mention both their positive and negative experience (22.95% each). LIS college educators should take this find- ing into consideration, and try to change students' attitude towards online learning into a positive one. The second categoiy - reflection - turns out to be larger within LIS univer- sity students than within LIS college stu- dents (59.09% versus 40.90%). Within both kinds of LIS students the three larg- est categories are: meta-analysis, process of learning and personal meta-analysis. But within LIS college students the sub- category of negative attitude was quite a bit larger than within LIS university stu- dents, close to the personal meta-analysis sub-category. Again, this finding reflects a lower level of satisfaction with the online course within LIS college students. The next category, collaboration, a ma- jor parameter within distance education, is larger within LIS university students (64.28%) than within LIS college students (35.71%). LIS university students empha- size active discussion, different perspec- tives, and interest as major components of collaboration. LIS college students stress interest, enjoyment and then discuss col- laborative learning. Based on the last two categories, perhaps LIS college educators should be aware of the great potential of developing deep content-based discus- sions in online forums and should try to present their students with deeper, more complex issues which require collaborative work, in order that students would use high- er cognitive skills and would work together and be exposed to their peers' views. The next category, dealing with course materials, is larger within LIS college students (58.33%) than within LIS uni- versity students (41.66%). Both groups mention the level of interest, the difficul- ties and the structure of the materials. The last category - course management - is larger within LIS university students (53.12%) than within LIS college students (46.87%). This category includes positive and negative criticism sub-categories in both institutions, but LIS university stu- dents expressed more positive feedback (58.82%) while LIS college students ex- pressed more negative criticism (73.33%). Again, LIS university students seem more satisfied with an online course than LIS college students. In conclusion, LIS university students are more satisfied with their online learn-
31 6 JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE ing experience and LIS university students discuss and express more reflective, ana- lytic meta-cognitive aspects of the learn- ing process than their college counterparts. They address more focal and key issues of the learning process, such as collabora- tion, in their feedback. This result echoes another study that found differences be- tween LIS university students and LIS col- lege students regarding their perceptions of librarians and information specialists (Aharony, 2006). This difference may re- sult from differing perceptions among LIS university and college students concerning their studies. Perhaps the LIS university students perceive their studies as more theoretical than those who study at a LIS professional academic college, thus con- centrating more on academic, reflective dimensions of the learning process. Further research should examine stu- dents' feedback in other online courses both at the university and at college. More- over, as this study was conducted in Israel, it is recommended to replicate this study in other countries, thus gaining a more thor- ough perspective of LIS students' experi- ences in online courses. The researcher suggests that additional research address other aspects of the learning process in LIS online learning, such as learners' mo- tivation to participate in online learning or student perceptions towards various fac- tors in online learning.
