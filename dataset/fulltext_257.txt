Introduction Recently, the level and structure of state aid to local public libraries in Pennsylvania have changed. In 2000, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania embarked on an aid enhancement program for local public libraries. This program increased state aid from approximately $30 million in 1999 to $75 million in 2002, after little growth in the years prior to 2000. The purpose of the aid enhancement program was not only to provide greater external funding to boost library services but also to stimulate local government financing. Local revenue effort provisions were made more favorable for receiving certain types of state aid. While most categories of library aid continued to require that specific qualitative standards be met, enhancement aid placed increased emphasis on inducing greater local fiscal support. The current research investigates a significant policy issue for local public libraries. This concerns the impact that state library aid has on local public library expenditures and revenues. One of the main empirical questions is whether state aid stimulates local government financing. Aid stimulation occurs if local library spending increases by more than the amount of aid received. Thus, in order for aid to be stimulative, it must increase not only expenditures but also local own‐source revenue. If spending increases by less than the amount of aid, then aid presumably replaces own‐source local revenue and provides local fiscal relief.3 This apparently was the case for Pennsylvania libraries during the first two years of aid enhancement. Their reliance on state library aid increased and own‐source revenue decreased in the enhancement period. State aid as a percentage of local revenue increased from 16 percent in 1996 to 27 percent in 2002. A few previous studies have investigated the effect of federal aid programs on state and local library spending.4 However, little research has been done on the effect of state aid on local library spending. The experience of Pennsylvania local libraries over the last several years offered an excellent opportunity to estimate the extent of grant stimulation and fiscal relief for local libraries. The current research estimated the extent of expenditure response to aid. Further, it tested whether expenditure response was different during the first two years of aid enhancement (2000–2001). The quantitative effect of state library aid on local library expenditures is an empirical question. In this article, the determinants of local library expenditures and state aid were estimated simultaneously because they were assumed interdependent. In this two‐stage process, local library officials make expenditure decisions by interacting with elected officials and voters through the democratic political process. It follows that factors influencing the demand of local citizens are important in determining the library’s spending decisions. The empirical analysis undertaken in this article involved pooling annual observations for public libraries in all sixty‐seven Pennsylvania counties. It covered the six years between 1996 and 2001. It differed in several respects from previous empirical studies of library and other expenditures. First, the stimulative effect of aid was investigated in separate, simultaneous equations. The two‐stage least squares procedure was used to estimate the determination of local library expenditures and state aid. Second, library expenditures and state aid were estimated for local governments within a given state. The advantage was that it reduced the effect of institutional differences that existed across state governments. Third, estimation across time provided results for predicting each county government’s response to changes in the various determinants over time. It enabled estimation of the effect of growth variables such as state aid on expenditures. Further, it allowed for comparison of the level of state aid in high‐growth and low‐growth periods. The next section reviews the results on the impact of grants from various empirical studies. A description of the categories and growth of state aid then follows. This also includes statistics on local library revenues and expenditures. Special features of the data are then considered. A detailed exposition of the empirical model follows. This provides the basis for empirical estimation. The results of empirical estimation then are tested and discussed. Finally, results are summarized, conclusions are offered, and limitations are noted. 3.  Frank Gourdy [1] found that approximately 65 percent of general revenue‐sharing grants resulted in new spending and that approximately 35 percent substituted for state and local revenue. 4.  In addition to Goudy’s research [1], Bruce Kingma, Joseph Shubert, and Amanda Yeoh [2] investigated how a change in the federal library aid program affected state library spending and income. Previous Empirical Studies The conceptual analysis of grants fostered a large body of empirical work concerning their role in state and local finance. In recent years, two major issues have dominated empirical research on the effects of intergovernmental aid. Both issues were concerned mainly with the fiscal response of state and local governments to the receipt of aid. The first issue concerned estimating the stimulative/replacement effect of aid, while the second issue concerned estimating the extent of the flypaper effect. Many empirical studies have investigated the stimulative effect of aid. However, few have provided evidence of the fiscal response to library aid. Gold and Lowenstein [3] provided a table listing the estimated fiscal impacts of federal aid taken from more than twenty‐five empirical studies. In most of these studies, expenditures were regressed on aid and other explanatory variables. Expenditures were usually measured by the total dollar amount spent by state or local governments. A few studies estimated the grant’s impact on specific expenditures like highways [4], welfare [5–6], and education [6]. All the studies in the Gold and Lowenstein [3] survey showed that the expenditure response to aid was positive. However, none of the later studies (1973–86) showed that grants were stimulative, whereas most of the earlier studies (1966–71) showed they were. The estimated expenditure response to each dollar of aid was between $.20 and $.90 in the later studies, while it was between $1.30 and $2.50 in the earlier studies. One reason for the reduced expenditure response was that several categories of federal aid changed their focus from aid stimulation to fiscal relief. In any event, the results from the later studies were thought to be more convincing because they offered improved econometric specification of the estimating equations. Evidence from other studies also showed that different categories of grants elicited different expenditure responses. Generally, a pure matching grant requires a matching local revenue contribution from local governments, while a nonmatching grant does not. Consequently, a larger local expenditure response would be expected from a matching grant. The empirical results seem to confirm these expectations.5 The flypaper effect deals with a local government’s expenditure response to the receipt of a nonmatching grant. The receipt of a nonmatching grant can be viewed like additional private income because it has no conditions attached to its use. Consequently, it should have the same effect on expenditures as the receipt of additional private income. However, evidence showed expenditure response to nonmatching aid was greater than what was found for private income variables. One reason for this is the flypaper effect, which asserts that local public officials view the receipt of aid as found money rather than as additional community income. In other words, grant money tends to stick where it hits. Public officials are more likely to use grant receipts to finance local services than to distribute it to the community in the form of tax relief. The flypaper effect has been widely investigated by many empirical studies.6 Evidence of the flypaper effect has been found by numerous researchers [9–13]. While little evidence exists on the effects of aid on library expenditures, several studies have investigated the connection between library expenditures and use. Library use is usually considered an output measure of library services, while expenditures reflect the dollar value of various inputs used to produce those services. Library use refers to the production activities of libraries, including transactions, hours of operation, and availability of material resources [14, p. 43]. Expenditures per capita also indicate the capability of the library to provide services. Therefore, the analysis of input and output decisions focuses on the effectiveness of the library as the main decision‐making unit.7 Martha Kyrillidou [14, p. 44] found that various input measures did not relate well to output measures such as reference transactions, circulation, interlibrary loans, and bibliographic instruction. Although little of her own evidence was offered, this conclusion was based on previous empirical studies and statistics from the Association of Research Library Statistics. Daniel O’Connor and Robert Fortenbaugh [18] found some interesting results from their study of New Jersey public libraries. They used simple linear regression to estimate the determinants of library funding and library usage. It was assumed that library funding and library use were determined separately. Consequently, ordinary least squares regression was used to estimate separate equations for library funding (library income per capita) and library use (circulation per capita). Library funding had a positive relationship with education (percent of community with some college), and library use had a positive relationship with library income per capita. Percentage of variation explained ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $R^{2}$ \end{document} ) by the library funding and the library use equations were approximately 27 percent and 53 percent, respectively. This study was one of the few that empirically investigated the determinants of library inputs and library outputs separately. However, their estimation results explained the effect of few other explanatory variables on library funding or use, and the simultaneity problem was not considered. Several previous empirical studies have attempted to explain library use mostly from the perspective of consumers of library services. Early studies of library users identified variables that reflected differences in age, gender, education, income, occupation, race, marital status, and unemployment and population density.8 Many studies have also investigated the determinants of academic library use by students [22–23]. A recent article by William McGrath [24] gave a good review of empirical studies between 1990 and 2001 that have investigated the determinants of circulation and use. Another area of empirical investigation concerns quality of service. Service quality ultimately depends upon consumer satisfaction and well‐being. Therefore, outcomes should reflect better informed and more highly satisfied users.9 Unfortunately, it is difficult to find quantitative measures of public outcomes. John Bertot and Charles McClure [27] offered a good review of library studies that have attempted to define outcomes and developed appropriate methodology for conducting outcomes assessment. 5.  Ronald Fisher [7, pp. 221–26] gives a good review of the evidence for different categories of aid. 6.  James Hines and Richard Thaler [8] provide a good review of the empirical issues. 7.  Studies investigating library effectiveness contrast with those investigating efficiency [15–17]. These efficiency studies were concerned with identifying the smallest set of inputs for producing a given output. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a linear programming technique that has been used to measure efficiency. DEA is especially useful for organizations like libraries that produce multiproduct or multiservice outputs from multiple inputs. 8.  Carol Kronus [19, p. 116] gave a summary of variables that were employed in forty‐five studies of adult library use. Douglas Zweizig [20] and George D’Elia [21] also offered models that investigated the effect of various independent variables on use. 9.  D’Elia and Walsh [25] provided an excellent conceptual discussion of user satisfaction. In October 2000, a symposium of articles was presented on library service quality at the Association of Research Library meetings. See Kyrillidou and Fred Heath [26] for the introductory overview of this symposium. Descriptive Statistics on State Library Aid and Local Library Finance Pennsylvania public libraries receive seven different categories of state aid. Table 1 summarizes each grant category’s main features, allocation criteria, and payment method.10 Incentive for Excellence Aid is the only aid category with matching provisions tied to local effort. However, it is not an open‐ended matching grant because the matching funds stop once expenditures per capita are above $15.00. The receipt of Equal Distribution Grants and Equalization Aid also depends on local financial effort because they require a minimum local effort. Aid receipts are based on population for several aid categories. Payments for Quality Libraries Aid, District Library Center Aid, and Equalization Aid are received in a fixed amount per capita. Payment of County Coordination Aid is based on the county’s class in the county classification system. This specifies a decrease in the matching rate as population range increases.

Several aid categories further require that libraries meet basic standards. These include Quality Libraries Aid, Incentive for Excellence Aid, Equal Distribution Grants, and Equalization Aid. Basic standards specify qualitative and financial performance criteria that must be met by the library. Specific standards give requirements related to collection size, hours of service, interlibrary loan policy, Internet policy, per capita expenditures, program participation, librarian certification requirements, and several other factors.11 Most counties do not receive all seven categories of grants, but a few do. The receipt of one aid category does not preclude receipt of another category. The annual amounts received by state‐aided Pennsylvania libraries for different categories of state aid are given in the first part of table 2. It shows that a substantial increase in state aid (G) occurred during the first two years (2000–2001) of the enhancement aid program. Aid more than doubled between 1999 and 2001 when it increased from $30.3 million to $62.3 million. Total state aid changed only slightly between 1996 and 1999. It increased from $26.2 million to $30.3 million.12 Table 2 Financial Statistics for State‐Aided Pennsylvania Public Libraries (Financial Statistics Are in $1,000s), 1996–2001 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 Total state aid:  Quality Libraries Aid 6,367.4 6,941.2 7,149.6 7,364.0 15,354.0 18,226.4  Incentive for Excellence 6,367.4 6,941.2 7,149.6 7,364.0 16,374.0 20,247.0  Equalization Aid 720.2 785.1 808.7 833.0 832.9 833.0  Equal Distribution Aid 1,213.7 1,328.5 1,370.2 1,435.3 1,435.3 1,435.0  County Coordination Aid 2,547.0 2,776.5 2,859.8 2,945.6 2,945.6 7,946.0  District Library Center Aid 7,700.7 8,389.2 8,639.2 8,874.3 8,874.3 12,128.8  Regional Resource Center Aid 1,273.5 1,388.2 1,429.9 1,472.8 1,472.8 1,472.8   Total (G) 26,189.9 28,549.9 29,407.0 30,289.0 47,288.9 62,289.0 Local revenue sources:  Local government income 126,757.5 133,306.8 137,393.6 144,020.0 154,434.7 160,308.1  Other 41,310.0 39,926.6 42,580.5 44,370.5 42,137.8 43,493.6   Total (LR) 168,067.5 173,233.4 179,974.1 188,390.5 196,572.5 203,801.7 Operating expenditure:  Wages and salaries 122,483.4 128,734.6 135,884.7 143,350.9 157,200.3 165,023.6  Books and periodicals 28,331.1 30,414.2 31,782.0 33,203.6 38,075.6 41,060.8  Other 51,486.8 49,623.1 49,737.8 55,949.1 56,392.2 65,855.5   Total (E) 202,301.3 208,771.9 217,404.5 232,503.6 251,668.1 271,939.9 \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $G/ E$ \end{document} .129 .137 .135 .130 .188 .229 \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $LR/ E$ \end{document} .831 .830 .828 .810 .781 .749 Note.—G = state aid, E = statewide library expenditures, and LR = local government revenue. Quality Libraries Aid and Incentive for Excellence Aid are the two main sources of state library aid. They accounted for a major portion of the increase in enhancement aid. Both categories of aid showed substantial increases in 2000 and 2001. They were the only categories to show an increase in 2000, the first year of the aid enhancement program. The increases resulted from increased payment per capita under Quality Libraries Aid and a higher matching rate for per capita expenditures under Incentive for Excellence Aid. In 1999, a total of $7.4 million was paid for each of these two aid categories. In 2001, Quality Libraries Aid increased to $18.3 million, and Incentive for Excellence Aid increased to $20.3 million. The combined percentage of total state aid received from these two categories increased from 48.6 percent to 61.8 percent between 1999 and 2001. County Coordination Aid and District Library Center Aid were two other aid categories that increased in 2001. County Coordination Aid increased from $2.9 million in 2000 to $7.9 million in 2001. Receipt of County Coordination Aid requires that libraries implement a countywide cooperative plan to improve and extend services. The amount of County Coordination Aid paid is based on a percentage match for libraries that receive a direct county appropriation. Pennsylvania classifies its sixty‐seven counties from first class to eighth class. Each county class has a stipulated range of population where larger counties have a lower classification number. Matching rates vary from 100 percent for eighth‐class counties to 57 percent and lower for second‐ through seventh‐class counties. These rates are given in table 1. District Library Center Aid is paid to twenty‐eight libraries designated by the state librarian to make their resources and services available to those in assigned districts and to render certain other services to local libraries in the district. It increased from $8.8 million in 2000 to $12.1 million in 2001. Pennsylvania counties also received state library aid from three other aid categories, which did not change in the first two years of the aid enhancement program. These were Regional Resource Center Aid, Equal Distribution Aid, and Equalization Aid. Four libraries throughout the state designated to serve as regional resource centers received regional aid. However, it increased from $1.5 million in 2001 to $3.5 million in 2002. Equal Distribution Aid paid each library a fixed amount ($2,281.40 in 2000) to supplement its materials budget. Equalization Aid was paid to selected libraries that met criteria for being in an economically distressed municipality and maintained or exceeded financial effort of the previous year. In addition to intergovernmental aid data, table 2 gives annual financial statistics for local revenue and expenditures. Library operating expenditures increased from $202.3 million in 1996 to $271.9 million in 2001. Library operating expenditures included payments for salary and wages, employee benefits, books and material acquisitions, and other current expenditures. The highest rates of growth in operating expenditures and local government revenue occurred between 1999 and 2001. Expenditures (E) increased $39.4 million (about 17 percent), and local government revenue (LR) increased $15.4 million (about 8.2 percent). However, total state aid (G) increased $32.0 million (about 105.6 percent). Moreover, other local income declined by almost a million dollars between 1999 and 2001.13 It was also a smaller percentage of total local revenue in 2001 than it was in 1996. It declined from 24.6 percent to 21.3 percent. These fiscal patterns suggest that state aid partially replaced local government revenue. Sizable increases of state aid were associated with increases in library operating expenditures, but the increases were less than the increases in aid. Thus, some of the increased aid apparently was used to reduce what would have been needed from local government support. Aid replacement is indicated when local revenue is a smaller percentage and aid is a larger percentage of operating expenditures. State aid increased as a percentage of operating expenditures from about 13 percent in all years between 1996 and 1999 to 18.8 percent in 2000 and 22.9 percent in 2001. At the same time, local revenue as a percentage of expenditures fell from 83.1 percent in 1996 to 74.9 percent in 2001. Another way to analyze expenditure change is to look at the expenditures on library personnel. Expenditures on wage and salaries accounted for the major portion of operating expenditures. Table 2 shows that this was more than 60 percent of operating expenditures in all years between 1996 and 2001. In all years, the growth rate for wages and salaries ranged between 5.0 percent and 5.6 percent, except between 1999 and 2000, when it increased 9.7 percent. Further, it grew by 34.7 percent between 1996 and 2001. Libraries also spent significant amounts on books and materials. Expenditures on books and materials increased 23.8 percent between 1999 and 2001. Expenditures on books and materials were 14 percent of operating expenditures in 1996, while they were 15.1 percent of operating expenditures in 2000 and 2001. Other operating expenditures also contributed to a significant increase in current operating expenditures. These expenditures were for children, young adult and adult services, library administration, information services, interlibrary loan service, technical services, audiovisual materials, and public relations. Other expenditures increased 27.9 percent between 1996 and 2001. However, they were 25.4 percent of current operating expenditures in 1996 and 24.2 percent in 2001. 10.  Most of the information in table 1 was obtained from “Categories of State Aid” [28], an internal document prepared by the State Library of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania Department of Education, Bureau of Library Development. Also, see Pennsylvania Library Laws [29] for more complete and detailed information on the aid categories. 11.  Basic standards are summarized in “Categories of State Aid” [28] and detailed in Pennsylvania Library Laws [29]. Specific standards are given in considerable detail for library systems, local libraries, and branch libraries. 12.  The trend of increasing state aid continued in 2002. Total state aid appropriated in 2002 and 2003 was an identical $75.3 million. Further, the appropriations decreased to $47.8 million in 2004 and $57.8 million in 2005. 13.  Other local income includes dividend and interest income, gifts, donations and fund drive revenue, merchandise sold, fines, other charges, library use and rental income, and other miscellaneous revenue. In addition, libraries also received a small amount of federal aid. Total federal aid receipts were between $2.6 million and $3.4 million between 1996 and 2001. Description of Sample and Data Sources Public libraries included in this study’s sample are considered state aided. In order to be state aided, libraries must have met state standards and received state aid. Non‐state‐aided libraries did not receive state aid either because they did not meet the standards or because they chose not to apply. Each sample unit consisted of those state‐aided public libraries located in a given county’s service area. A state‐aided public library within a given county can be a local library, a county library, or a county library system. These different types of state‐aided libraries are described as follows [28–29]: 1.  A local library is established and maintained by a municipality or by a private association to meet the needs of all the residents of the area for which its governing body is responsible. 2.  A county library derives income based on allocations from county commissioners. It is intended to bring library service to those county residents not served by other local libraries located within the same county. 3.  A library system is a county‐level federation of at least two local libraries that serves at least 25,000 people. Libraries voluntarily agree to participate in the federation and to delegate the policy‐making function to a system board of directors. Variables used in this study were aggregated and reported as one county total. The county totals may not capture the structural differences in operation and financing across local libraries within each county. Many counties had different combinations of library types. In 2000, local libraries in thirty‐five of Pennsylvania’s sixty‐seven counties pooled their operations to qualify as a library system for state aid on behalf of their combined service areas. In many counties, library systems accounted for all aid receipts. However, several large counties had a combination of local libraries, county libraries, and library systems within their service areas. Two counties, Montgomery and Schuylkill, had two library systems. Philadelphia reported aid receipts for one library unit, Philadelphia Free Library. Many of the thirty‐two counties that did not have a library system operated a county library. Several of the smaller counties had only a single county library that reported aid receipts. The statistics on library finances were derived from two separate annual reports of the Pennsylvania Office of Commonwealth Libraries, Bureau of Library Development. These were Summary of State Aid to Public Libraries [30] and Pennsylvania Library Statistics [31]. Both publications provided aggregate statistics for each of Pennsylvania’s sixty‐seven counties. Summary of State Aid is an annual report of the various categories of aid paid to public libraries and library systems in Pennsylvania. Aid payments were based on what the state government appropriated to libraries in its fiscal year that ran from July 1 to June 30. Library Statistics is also an annual publication that reported statistics on income, expenditures, resources, and usage for local libraries and library systems in Pennsylvania. Library Statistics was dated based on fiscal years similar to those used for the Summary of State Aid. However, the fiscal year of Library Statistics often did not correspond with the fiscal year of Summary of State Aid. It is estimated that approximately 90 percent of Pennsylvania public libraries reported income and expenditures based on the previous calendar year rather than on the current fiscal year. For instance, the 2001–2 Statistics mostly reported income and expenditures for the 2001 calendar year, while the 2001–2 Summary of State Aid reported aid receipts for the 2002 fiscal year. In any given year, income and expenditure variables shown in the Statistics publication were matched against state aid variables from the preceding year’s Summary of State Aid publication. This procedure was essential in order to estimate the influence of current year aid on current year expenditures.14 State aid is treated as a single total amount rather than using the individual amounts for each aid category. The main reason was the higher annual variation found in total aid than in individual categories of aid. Many counties received the same amounts of aid categories over several years. However, few received the same total amount for all categories of aid in consecutive years. Further, many counties did not receive any aid for certain categories. Finally, this study is mainly concerned with the stimulation/replacement response of expenditures to changes in total aid. Population statistics used to distribute different categories of state aid were from data published in the U.S. census population reports. State publications [30–31] show that population for the library service areas was based on the 1990 census during the first four years (1996–99) and on the 2000 census during the last two years (2000–2001). However, these population statistics did not capture the annual growth in population. Therefore, all per capita variables used the annual population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau’s [32] Web site. These estimates were based on the number of people living within an entire county area. In only a few cases were substantial differences found between the county service area population reported in state publications and the annual census population estimates.15 The other variables in model estimation were obtained from various sources. These sources included “Categories of State Aid” [28], Pennsylvania Library Laws [29], Pennsylvania Statistical Abstract [33], Pennsylvania Local Government Financial Statistics [34], “Selected Expenditure Data for Pennsylvania Public Schools” [35], and Survey of Current Business [36–37]. The specific variables that were obtained from these sources are given in appendix A. 14.  I would like to thank Matt Kane of the Office of Commonwealth Libraries, Bureau of Library Development, for clarifying this point. 15.  The Bureau of Economic Analysis population estimates were highly correlated with service area population. They had a simple correlation coefficient of 0.98. Empirical Model An overview of the model and specification of estimating equations.— The specification of the empirical model is based on the principles from the theory of grants literature. In this literature, grants are broadly classified as matching and nonmatching. Matching grants require some local revenue match, while nonmatching grants are lump‐sum payments that do not require a local revenue match. Matching grants effectively lower the relative price to localities because each dollar spent is accompanied by matching funds from the state government.16 No such price effect is assumed for nonmatching grants. The empirical model predicts that both price and purchasing power effects are associated with the receipt of matching state aid.17 If the matching rate increases, this implies a lower price for library services. The lower price tends to increase the quantity demanded of library services. At the same time, the purchasing power effect provides the locality with more real income and increases the demand for library services. Expenditures may increase by more or less than the full amount of the grant depending upon the combined size of the price and purchasing power effects.18 Empirical estimation is based on the presumed interdependence between state aid and local public library expenditures. Certain categories of library aid depend on expenditures because they require local revenue effort in order to receive them. At the same time, expenditures are a function of state aid because aid finances operating expenditures. Consequently, separate simultaneously determined equations are required for estimating the determinants of expenditures (E) and state aid (G). Ordinary least squares estimation is not appropriate if the E and G are simultaneously determined because it does not take into account the information provided by the other equation in the system [38, p. 718]. In this article, an alternative estimation procedure called “two‐stage least squares” is employed to estimate the two simultaneous equations. The functional form of the two equations is assumed multiplicative. The multiplicative function is nonlinear where an exponential relation is assumed between the dependent variable and independent variables. This suggests a constant elasticity across time and counties. Linear regression can be used to estimate multiplicative functions by transforming their variables into a linear form. This is achieved by taking the natural log of variables in each equation. The estimated coefficients give the elasticity of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variables. Thus, they give the percentage change in the dependent variable for a 1 percent change in the explanatory variable.19 The definitions for the discrete and dummy variables in the two equations are given in table 3. Summary statistics also are given for discrete variables. All variables expressed in current dollars were adjusted for inflation by using the Consumer Price Index to convert them to constant dollars.

The two‐stage least squares estimation procedure is used to estimate the two equations. The variables in Equations (1a) and (1b) are based on the second stage estimation of expenditures and grants. Each equation includes the fitted value of the other endogenous variable obtained in the first stage and the actual values of the other predetermined variables.20 The two second‐stage estimating equations included in this procedure are as follows: 16.  In the simplest case, the receipt of a matching grant reduces the effective price of a dollar spent on local library expenditures. If m is the percentage matching rate paid for each dollar of expenditures on library services (E), then the effective price is reduced from E to \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $( 1-m) E$ \end{document} . For instance, if \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $m=.40$ \end{document} , the effective price of each dollar of expenditures is reduced from $1 to $0.60. 17.  In microeconomic theory, the actual quantity change from a price change is broken down into these two separate effects. They often are referred to as the substitution (price) effect and the income (purchasing power) effect. The price effect refers to the substitution of the cheaper aided activity for other activities whose prices do not change. The purchasing power effect refers to the increased ability to consume because at the lower price the local government spends less on the same quantity of the aided activity. Thus local governments had additional real income to spend on all goods. Some of this income could also have been spent on the aided service. 18.  However, the price effect of a matching grant may also be limited if it is closed‐ended. A closed‐ended grant allows a matching grant only up to a certain limit. If the recipient government spends more than the limit before receiving the grant, then its effect is similar to a nonmatching grant. See Fisher [7, pp. 208–19] for a good discussion of this point. 19.  If the natural logarithmic value of the dependent variable is regressed on the independent variable measured in its original units, the estimated coefficient gives the percentage change in the dependent variable for a one‐unit absolute change in the independent variable. Several explanatory variables were expressed in their original units rather than in natural logarithms. If the independent variable is not continuous, as in the case of dummy variables, then the relative change in the dependent variable can be computed by taking the antilog (to base e) of the estimated dummy variable coefficient and then subtracting one from it. See Damadar Gujarati [38, p. 525] for a discussion of these points. 20.  A predetermined explanatory variable is either an exogenous variable or a lagged dependent variable. An exogenous variable is one whose value is determined outside the system of equations being estimated. Expected effects of explanatory variables.— Principles from economic theory and library‐information science are used to specify the explanatory variables included in the two equations. These principles predict that the dependent variables respond in a certain way to these explanatory variables. It is assumed that the level of expenditures and state aid is determined by the choices of local elected officials and local public library administrators. Their decisions are based on the attempt to maximize net benefits of library users while maximizing their individual benefits. The expenditure levels chosen in this process are based on maximizing the probability of staying in office for elected officials and of obtaining the largest possible budget allocation for library officials. This analysis also assumes elected officials are responsive to the tastes of representative voters. The median voter is assumed to make the decisive choice under majority rule. The preferred expenditure level of the median voter is the one in which half of the voters want more and half of the voters want less. Under certain assumptions, the choice by the median voter leads to a unique political equilibrium. Public officials responding to local voters, therefore, largely determine the level of library services provided by a given locality. Variations in the level of library services across communities thus depend upon the resources and socioeconomic variables affecting the tastes and choices of library‐services consumers.21 State library aid provides additional resources and more favorable service prices to local public libraries. These changes determine the expected response of library expenditures. Variables affecting state aid response reflect differences in local operating expenditures, income, and other criteria related to the allocation of various categories of aid. The first part of this discussion analyzes the possible impact of state aid on operating expenditures in equation (1a). The impact depends on the size of the respective price and purchasing power effects of a grant. Both of these effects are expected to increase expenditures as long as the matching rate increases and the aided activity is a normal good.22 In the current study, library operating expenditures depend upon total state library aid in each county. It includes instruments with both matching and nonmatching provisions. The estimated coefficient of the state aid variable reflects the combined elasticity from both price and purchasing power effects. The empirical model does not attempt to estimate these effects separately, although they are useful for conceptual analysis. The estimated elasticity coefficient of state aid ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $a_{1}$ \end{document} ) in equation (1a) gives information about whether state aid stimulates or replaces local expenditures. If the dollar increase in E is greater than the dollar increase in G, then aid would be considered stimulative. However, if the dollar increase in E is less than the dollar increase in G, then some of the aid replaces local support from taxes and other income. In this event, increased aid provides local tax relief. The estimation of equation (1a), however, does not provide a direct measure of aid stimulation. The aid coefficient ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $a_{1}$ \end{document} ) is an estimate of expenditure elasticity. Elasticity is a measure of relative change and is expressed in percentages. Degree of stimulation or replacement measures absolute change. It refers to the effect of a dollar change in aid on the dollar amount of spending. It can be shown that if aid is stimulative, the aid elasticity coefficient ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $a_{1}$ \end{document} ) will be greater than the ratio of aid to expenditures (G/E).23 The differential slope coefficient, \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $a^{\prime }_{1}$ \end{document} , is included in equation (1a) to test whether aid enhancement changed the responsiveness of library expenditures to state aid.

The dummy variable for 2000 and 2001 (D0001) tests whether the level of library operating expenditures in the first two years of aid enhancement was significantly different from what it was in the previous four years. The differential intercept coefficient ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $a_{8}$ \end{document} ), therefore, tests whether aid enhancement was associated with a structural change in library spending. A positive coefficient predicts an upward shift, while a negative coefficient predicts a downward shift. The other explanatory variables in equation (1a) account for the possible influence of local budget practices, income, and tastes on expenditures. A lagged expenditure variable ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $E_{t-1}$ \end{document} ) is included because current budget appropriations are often based on the previous year’s expenditures plus an expected rate of growth.24 It is expected that current expenditures are positively related to the lagged expenditure variable. Another budgetary variable that may affect the level of operating expenditures is the proportion of local revenue received from nontax revenue (POTH). Nontax revenue includes such sources as donations, fines and fees, and investment income. The coefficient for POTH can be positive or negative. Its sign depends on whether local citizens prefer to use other revenue to finance more library services or to reduce debt. It is therefore a measure of citizens’ preference for services versus tax relief. The coefficient will be positive if citizens prefer more services and negative if they prefer to reduce debt or local taxes. Expenditures per capita are assumed positively responsive to the per capita income of private citizens because the items purchased with it are primarily normal goods. Per capita income (Y) is based on the annual personal income of county residents. It is expected that as personal income increases, the demand and provision of library services increases. Thus, \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $a_{3}$ \end{document} is expected to be positive. The effect of population density (DEN) on library expenditures (E) is unclear. On the cost side, the more dispersed the population is in a service area (lower DEN), the higher the cost for a library to provide a desired level of service to its residents. On the demand side, library users demand fewer library services if DEN is low because they have to travel longer distances. Therefore, a predominant cost side effect suggests a negative coefficient, while a predominant demand side effect suggests a positive coefficient. The four remaining variables (school expenditures [SCH], families as a percent of all households [FAM], library registration [REG], and median age of population [MEDAGE]) are included to account for differences in consumer tastes and demographic factors across counties. The variables SCH, FAM, and REG are expected to have positive signs, while MEDAGE is expected to have a negative sign. The SCH and REG variables reflect citizens’ demand for local public services. Counties that have high levels of school expenditures and high registration percentages prefer high levels of demand for library expenditures. The FAM and MEDAGE variables are demographic ones that are expected to affect the demand for library services. Counties that have a higher percentage of families and a lower median age are likely to demand more library expenditures. Equation (1b) is included in the empirical model to control for the interdependence between endogenous state library aid and endogenous library operating expenditures. Therefore, library operating expenditures are included in equation (1b). To the extent that the receipt of state aid depends on local effort, then one expects a positive coefficient ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $b_{1}$ \end{document} ) for E. Local libraries spend more on local operations because of the matching provisions and other incentives associated with certain categories of aid. Equation (1b) also includes three additional fiscal variables, \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $G_{t-1}$ \end{document} , POTH, and income per capita (Y).

This coefficient is expected to be positive because counties that received higher amounts of total state aid in the previous year are likely to receive larger increases in the current year. The POTH variable again reflects the private sector’s willingness to contribute to local government support. If its coefficient is positive, it implies that private sources support higher levels of state aid for libraries. If it is negative, it implies that private sources had a higher preference for reducing debt and obtaining tax relief. Finally, Y is expected to be negatively related to state aid. The distribution of several aid categories is based on equalizing income across counties. The dummy variables, DISLIB, DIST, and SYS, reflect other aid allocation criteria that influence the amounts received from various categories of aid. DISLIB indicates whether county libraries are in economically distressed municipalities. Pennsylvania libraries that are in an economically distressed municipality were entitled to Equalization Aid. A municipality is economically distressed if it is in the lowest percentile among all municipalities in one of these three categories: market value per capita, personal income per capita, or annual average unemployment rate. DIST indicates whether a county had a district library and received state aid for it. A separate category of aid was given to those counties that were designated as district libraries. SYS indicates whether a county had a library system or a county library where an appropriation was made by the county government for supporting such libraries. These conditions were required to receive County Coordination Aid. It is expected that counties that met these conditions had higher aid receipts than those that did not. The proportion of a county’s appropriation for County Coordination Aid increases as the county’s numerical classification increases. Therefore, dummy variables are included for the different county classes, with eighth‐class counties serving as the reference variable because they received the highest matching rate. All county dummy coefficients, therefore, are expected to be negative because of the more favorable aid allocation received by eighth‐class counties. An interactive intercept term (D0001) tests whether the level of per capita aid receipts was significantly higher in the enhancement years of 2000 and 2001. The coefficient ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $b_{10}$ \end{document} ) is expected to be positive, reflecting significantly higher enhancement aid receipts. 21.  Theodore Bergstrom and Robert Goodman [39] provide a standard reference that gives the assumptions of the collective choice model for local public services.

This approach uses the previous year’s expenditures as its base rather than starting from zero. Estimation Results Estimation procedure.— A simultaneous system of equations was estimated for Pennsylvania public libraries from the annual pooled data of sixty‐seven counties between 1996 and 2001. Each equation was based on a sample size of 402 observations. Multiple regression analysis was used to test whether variation in library expenditures and state aid depended upon the explanatory variables in the empirical model. In each regression equation, estimates of the relation between the dependent variable and the independent variables were tested to determine whether sample evidence supported or did not support certain hypothesized effects predicted by the expenditure‐aid model. Equations (1a) and (1b) were used to estimate the responsiveness of per capita library operating expenditures and per capita state aid in a simultaneous equation framework. These simultaneously determined endogenous variables were assumed to be jointly determined.25 The usual assumption of ordinary least squares estimation is that all the explanatory variables are uncorrelated with the error term. In that case, each equation can be estimated as if it is independent of the other one. This does not hold if the endogenous variables are simultaneously determined. The two‐stage least squares estimation procedure was used to estimate equations (1a) and (1b). This procedure used the information available from the specification of the equation system to obtain a unique estimate of each parameter in the model. Simultaneously determined endogenous variables must satisfy necessary and sufficient conditions for identification before they can be estimated.26 25.  Expenditures per capita (E) and state aid per capita (G) are endogenous variables because they are jointly determined within the system of eqq. (1a) and (1b). Exogenous variables are determined outside the system of equations. For a good discussion of simultaneous equation estimation, see Robert Pindyck and Daniel Rubinfeld [41, pp. 349–53]. 26.  For a simultaneously determined equation to be identified, it must satisfy rank and order conditions. Both eq. (1a) and eq. (1b) satisfied these conditions. The order condition was satisfied because the number of predetermined variables excluded from eq. (1a) and eq. (1b) were greater than the number of endogenous variables minus one. A procedure suggested by G. S. Maddala [42, pp. 301–2] was used to verify that eqq. (1a) and (1b) satisfied the rank condition for identification. Analysis of the effects of state aid on expenditures.— Table 4 gives the estimates from the two‐stage least squares procedure. Both the first‐stage and the second‐stage results are provided. First‐stage results show the estimated responses to all predetermined variables irrespective of whether they were included in the second‐stage estimating equations. The first‐stage equations do not include either of the endogenous variables on the right‐hand side. This stage was used to obtain the fitted values of the two endogenous variables. Second‐stage results showed the response of each endogenous variable to the fitted value of the other endogenous variable and the predetermined variables included in the economic model.27 The t‐statistics for each parameter in the second stage were based on the Newey‐West [43] standard errors corrected for autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity.28 Table 4 Regression Results Estimated Coefficients Equation 1a (ln E) Equation 1b (ln G) First Stage Second Stage First Stage Second Stage Coefficient t‐Statistic Coefficient t‐Statistic Coefficient t‐Statistic Coefficient t‐Statistic Constant 2.647 3.56 −1.61 −1.75 5.14 6.00 4.03 4.64 ln G … … .468 4.97*** … … … … D0001 x ln G .173 5.27*** .137 1.60 .189 4.99*** … … ln G t−1 −.025 −.86 … … .381 11.33*** .365 5.21*** ln E … … … … … … .551 7.97*** ln E t−1 .346 8.22*** .482 5.72*** −.056 −1.16 … … ln Y −.097 −1.18 .244 2.23** −.422 −4.46*** −.521 −5.29*** ln MV .118 3.31*** … … .060 1.47 … … ln DEN .039 2.13** .043 2.32** −.019 −.91 … … ln SCH .136 2.43** .153 2.50** .012 .18 … … REG .0019 3.11*** .0024 2.64*** −.0011 −1.48 … … POTH −.0025 −3.69*** .0022 2.32** −.0054 −6.89*** −.003 −3.06*** MEDAGE −.0074 −1.59 −.020 −2.62*** .0080 1.50 … … FAM −.0085 −2.62*** −.0068 −1.51 −.0059 −1.59 … … D0001 −.091 −3.00*** −.307 −4.90*** .337 9.66*** .461 16.71*** ln STAFF .576 15.52*** … … .463 10.84*** … … DISLIB −.019 −.92 … … .018 .76 .045 1.85* PREP .0019 1.94* … … .0040 3.60*** … … DIST .086 2.60*** … … .302 7.94*** .284 5.73*** SYS .101 4.03*** … … .176 6.08*** .214 5.47*** CLASS 12 .144 1.32 … … −.141 −1.12 −.680 −6.31*** CLASS23A −.050 −.74 … … −.154 −1.97** −.351 −4.95*** CLASS45 −.090 −1.73* … … −.153 −2.55** −.265 −4.42*** CLASS67 −.040 −1.01 … … −.103 −2.26** −.172 −3.58*** Adjusted \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $R^{\, 2}$ \end{document} .903 .842 .912 .899 * Statistically significant at the 10% level. ** Statistically significant at the 5% level. *** Statistically significant at the 1% level.

Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that state aid increased library expenditures in all years of this study. Further, expenditures (E) were more responsive to state aid (G) in 2000 and 2001. The higher elasticity coefficient in the enhancement period suggests that improved incentives increased expenditure response, although the probability of error was a little high. These results also showed that state aid stimulated library operating expenditures in almost every county in the years of this study. In other words, expenditures increased by more than the amount of state aid. The degree of stimulation in a specific county and in a specific year depends upon the relative values of the elasticity coefficient ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $a_{1}$ \end{document} ) and the ratio of aid to expenditures ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $G/ E$ \end{document} ).29 If \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $( G/ E) < 0.468$ \end{document} in the preenhancement years, and \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $( G/ E) < 0.605$ \end{document} in the enhancement years, then aid is stimulative.

However, Cameron (55.7 percent), Lawrence (51.7 percent), and Juniata (49.0 percent) counties had ratios that were above 46.8 percent in 2001. Another question is whether the degree of aid stimulation in the enhancement years increased or decreased. This depended upon the rate at which G/E increased relative to the rate at which elasticity increased between the two periods. The elasticity coefficient increased approximately 29.3 percent in 2000 and 2001.30 Thus, in order for enhancement aid to have increased the degree of stimulation, G/E would have to increase by less than 29.3 percent.

Further, most counties showed the largest annual increase in this ratio in 2001, the second year of enhancement.31 Thus, enhancement aid had the effect of increasing expenditures for many counties by an amount less than the increase in aid. This suggests that many counties experienced some fiscal relief in the enhancement aid period. 27.  Excluded second‐stage predetermined variables from eq.

If the slope coefficient is greater than one, then state aid is stimulative. 30.  The 29.3 percent increase was computed as follows: 31.  Thirteen counties had a less than 29.3 percent increase in their G/E ratio between 1999 and 2000, while thirty‐two counties were below 29.3 percent between 2000 and 2001. Thus, the degree of stimulation increased across more counties during the second year of aid enhancement than during the first year. Analysis of the effects of other parameters in the model.— The discussion of the empirical model hypothesizes that in equation (1a), E is expected to be positively related to \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $E_{t-1}$ \end{document} , Y, FAM, REG, and SCH and negatively related to MEDAGE. The effect of DEN and POTH on E could be positive or negative. Most of the second‐stage estimates of equation (1a) were consistent with these expectations, although FAM had a negative sign and was not statistically significant. The results showed that lagged expenditures were a significant determinant of current expenditures. A 1 percent increase in lagged operating expenditures increased current expenditures by 0.482 percent. This is evidence that counties used incremental budgeting rather than zero‐based budgeting. The other explanatory variables in the model were statistically significant at the 5 percent or lower level and had the expected signs. The positive coefficient for DEN suggests a predominant demand side effect on expenditures. It was found that a 1 percent increase in DEN was associated with 0.043 percent increase in expenditures. In addition, a one‐year decrease in MEDAGE and a one percentage point increase in REG were associated with increases in E of 2 percent and 0.24 percent, respectively. The small, positive coefficient for POTH suggests a relatively low taxpayer preference for contributing to local support. A one percentage point increase in POTH was associated with a 0.22 percent increase in E. Finally, the estimated coefficient for SCH suggests it had a moderate, positive influence on library expenditures. Specifically, a 1 percent increase in SCH would be expected to increase expenditures by 0.153 percent. Income per capita (Y) was statistically significant but shows a relatively low income elasticity of 0.244. The estimated income elasticity for library expenditures was low when compared with those for other government functions. Fisher [7, p. 88], in reviewing evidence from several studies, showed income elasticities varied between 0.40 and 0.65 for education expenditures and between 0.90 and 1.30 for parks and recreation expenditures. Finally, the estimated differential intercept coefficient ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $a_{8}$ \end{document} ) had a significant negative sign. Thus, two separate functions were supported for the natural logarithm of E, one for the preenhancement years (1996–99) and one for the enhancement years (2000–2001). The coefficient for D0001 predicts an intercept that is 26.4 percent below what it was in the preenhancement years. However, this does not necessarily mean that per capita expenditures were lower in all years. It also depends on the size of differential elasticity coefficient ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $a^{\prime }_{1}$ \end{document} ). If it was high enough, it is possible that the enhancement period function could rise above the preenhancement period function.32 The estimation results from equation (1b) showed that per capita state aid was positively responsive to per capita library expenditures. Specifically, each percentage change in expenditures was positively associated with a 0.55 percent change in state aid. Thus, the results from estimating equations (1a) and (1b) simultaneously support the notion that state aid and library expenditures were interdependent. Expenditures were significantly responsive to state aid receipts in equation (1a), while state aid receipts were significantly responsive to expenditures in equation (1b). The variables that reflected the criteria used to distribute various categories of state aid all had positive coefficients that were statistically significant. Counties that met the criteria for DISLIB, DIST, and SYS received substantially more aid than those that did not. Aid was 4.6 percent higher in DISLIB counties, 32.8 percent higher in DIST counties, and 23.9 percent higher in SYS counties. Further, state aid was inversely related to income per capita. A 1 percent increase in per capita income was associated with a 0.52 percent decrease in state aid. Fiscal equalization apparently was a significant factor in the distribution of several aid categories. The previous year’s grant was also found to be a significant influence on the current year’s grant. A 1 percent higher grant in the previous year increased per capita aid in the current year by 0.365 percent. POTH was also found to be statistically significant, although its coefficient was very small. Its negative coefficient suggests a preference for using aid to reduce local debt or taxes. Specifically, it predicts that a one percentage point increase in other revenue reduces state aid 0.3 percent. The dummy variable for the enhancement years suggests that the log of state aid per capita was significantly higher in the enhancement years. These results predict that the differential intercept ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $b_{10}$ \end{document} ) was almost 59 percent above what it was in preenhancement years. It is also possible that grant response to expenditures was higher in the enhancement years, and an attempt was made to test for this. However, the differential response variable was not significant.33 Finally, the estimated coefficients for cross‐sectional dummy variables suggest that aid receipts were significantly less in all other classes than in eighth‐class counties. Receipts ranged from 15.8 percent below in sixth‐ and seventh‐class counties to 49.3 percent below in first‐ and second‐class counties. The predicted levels of E and G in equations (1a) and (1b) explained a high proportion of the variation in the dependent variables. Most of the explanatory variables were found to be statistically significant, and the coefficients of determination were high.

It occurs here because the differential intercept term and the differential slope term are both statistically significant. 33.  An interactive dummy variable for the slope coefficient was included in eq. (1b) to test whether grant response to library expenditures was higher in the enhancement aid years of 2000 and 2001. It was not found to be statistically significant ( \documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $p=.589$ \end{document} ). Summary and Conclusions This study considered the effect of state aid on the financing and provision of local public library services within a given state. While the provision of library services is primarily a local function, financing is a joint effort of state and local governments. In 2000, Pennsylvania embarked on an aid enhancement program that offered local libraries higher levels of aid and greater incentives to spend on library operations. One of the main purposes of this study was to estimate how local operating expenditures responded to changes in the level and structure of state aid. The empirical evidence showed that after controlling for other relevant variables, local expenditures were more responsive to aid in the enhancement period than they were before. The results showed that a 1 percent increase in aid increased expenditures 0.468 percent prior to enhancement and by 0.605 percent during the enhancement period. Another important finding was that state aid had a stimulative effect on local budgets. Increases in state aid led to proportionately larger increases in expenditures. Therefore, in any given year, the evidence suggested that aid not only increased expenditures but also encouraged localities to spend more than they had received. The stimulative effect of grants thus implies that local revenue sources supported some local operating expenditures. Finally, the degree of stimulation appeared to decrease in many counties during the enhancement years. Although expenditures increased, some of the additional aid was also used to reduce local government support. Therefore, enhancement aid provided some fiscal relief. The evidence from the first few years of the enhancement aid program suggested that changes in state aid were successful in achieving their intended effects. The policy of increasing state aid and providing greater incentives for local government support was an effective means of increasing library expenditures and services without placing a higher burden on local budgets. Nonetheless, the results from the first few years likely gave the estimated short‐run effects. Continued growth of state aid to Pennsylvania public libraries would be expected to elicit a different expenditure response in future years. The higher levels of state aid likely will be viewed as permanent if the increases continue in size and scope. Unfortunately, state aid did not show any growth in 2003, and sizable cuts were made in 2004 and 2005. This further complicates the empirical findings because the response of expenditures in a period of decline may not be symmetrical with that estimated in a period of growth [11–13]. The current article was limited to investigating the effect of state aid on library expenditures. The evidence showed that state government had a positive influence on the provision of local government services. These results imply desirable outcomes for local library consumers. Higher levels of expenditures were likely to make more library services available to users. One might conclude that library users were better off after the receipt of state aid than they were before. In order to test this, variables reflecting library use and outcomes were needed. No such measures were offered nor were any hypotheses about the expenditure‐service‐outcome connection tested. This connection is quite complicated. Potential problems include difficult measurement issues, incorrect specification of complicated production and consumption relations, and the presence of serious econometric problems.34 Future research should be concerned with investigating the relationship between expenditures and use.35 It should also include a careful analysis of outcomes. 34.  See Eric Hanushek [44, esp. pp. 354–76] for a complete review of these problems as they relate to educational production functions. See Raymond Horton [45] for a more recent survey of the spending‐service connection from the public manager’s perspective. 35.  Sharkansky [46] and other researchers [47–49] have investigated the expenditure‐service connection, but the evidence has been less than convincing. Their results varied from showing a significant positive relation to showing no statistical significance. One of the main conclusions of these studies is that the significance of this relation may well depend on the type of expenditure being investigated.
