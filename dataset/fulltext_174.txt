Doctorate Recipients in Library Science: How They Compare with Doctorate Recipients in Other Disciplines PATRICIA G. REELING Characteristics of doctorate recipients in library science were compared with those in other disciplines to identify factors that may aid in the recruitment and retention of Ph.D. students in library and information science programs. Factors explored include: (1) trends in the annual production of doctoral degrees; (2) characteristics of LIS doctorate recipients, including gender, race, citizenship, undergraduate major, institutions of higher education attended, median age, median length of time taken to complete the doctorate, and postdoctoral plans; and (3) differences between those library science doctorate recipients planning to teach and those planning other professional careers. Data were derived from a special tabulation of the National Research Council's annual Survey of Earned Doctorates, 1970-1990. Interviews with deans/directors responsible for administering library and infor- mation science doctoral programs were also conducted to ascertain what they consider to be major challenges facing them in regard to recruitment and retention of doctoral students at their own institutions. A key factor affecting the capacity of a library and informa- tion science program to flourish in an academic setting is its ability to attract outstanding faculty who are both qualified to conduct research and enthusiastic about educating the next generation of librarians and information specialists. For the past several years, however, educators have expressed concern that there may be developing a shortage of individuals with the doctorate who will be available to teach in library Patricia G. Reeling is an Associate Professor of Communication, Information, and Library Studies at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey. This paper pre- sents the outcome of the 1991 Alise Research Award project. Fall 1992 311
Journal of Education for Library and Information Science and information science programs in this country. Barbara Moran, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, noted in her report on the 1988 ALISE conference: Another impending personnel shortage was evident at this year's conference: Schools of information and library science may themselves be facing a shortage of faculty members in the near future. Mirroring the general trend in academia, a greying of library faculty has occurred, with many retirements expected in the next few years. What is not clear is whether there will be enough qualified library educators to replace those retiring. Since a large number of library and informa- tion science Ph.D.s go into library administration rather than teaching, there may indeed be a shortfall. For those schools attempting to recruit new faculty at the conference, the shortfall appeared to have already arrived: there were fewer candidates interviewing for teaching positions than schools seeking new faculty.1 The same situation occurred the following year when, at the January 1989 ALISE conference, only twenty-six candidates were available to fill more than fifty faculty openings.2 No doubt shoptalk among conferees at both the 1988 and 1989 meetings served to make doctoral education and recruitment of Ph.D. students the focus of ALISE preconferences in 1990 and 1991. Even in 1992, despite the economic recession's dele- terious impact on higher education in general, as well as the threatened closing of still more library schools, deans and directors continued to cite the shortage of faculty as a major problem. The American Library Association has also been concerned about a potential shortage of library school faculty. At hearings held by the U.S. Department of Education in November, 1989, Richard M. Dougherty, ALA president, testified in support of Title IIB fellowships for doctoral students. We will need faculty capable of doing research. The profession of library and information studies has fewer than 2,500 persons holding doctoral degrees. A larger-than-average proportion of librarians will reach retirement age through the year 2000. Fully 15 percent of the approximately 550 library school faculty in this country are 60 years of age or older; 32 percent are 55 or over. In the fall of 1988, 295 doctoral students were enrolled, the majority in librarianship or information science, but some in cognate fields. Of the 295, 169 were foreign, leaving 126 in the probable pool for faculty of U.S. and Canadian schools. An assumed completion rate of 75 percent (which is on the generous side) leaves 94 available doctorates. Generally, over half of those who receive the doctorate go into library administration, not teaching. Assuming that 48 percent of the 94 would be interested in library education, 45 persons would be looking for a teaching position. In fall 1988, the accredited graduate library education pro- grams made 56 appointments; thus, there are and will be more slots than people to fill them.3 Certainly the library and information science field is not unique. In Prospects for Faculty in the Arts and Sciences: A Study of Factors Affecting Demand and Supply, 1987 to 2012, authors William G. Bowen, former Princeton al¿ Volume 33, Number 4
Doctorate Recipients in Library Science University president and now president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foun- dation, and Julie Ann Sosa projected that just 0.83 candidates will be available for each teaching position by 1997-2002, with only 30,934 new faculty members to fill an estimated 37,091 positions.4 A perusal of featured articles in The Chronicle of Higher Education also leads one to conclude that many fields were beginning in 1989-90 to feel the pinch.5 At the same time, John H. D'Arms, dean of the graduate school at the University of Michigan and president of the Association of American Universities wrote Unlike the period of enormous expansion of numbers of Ph.D.' s in the 1960's when ... we failed to foresee the impending glut of Ph.D. 's, we have the solid data and careful analyses that policy makers need, if only they will heed the messages. The real danger is that we again will mis-time our response and wait to act until shortages become acute. That would be tragic: The Ph.D.'s needed by the late 90 's should be entering graduate school now, so as to be ready when market forces begin to exert their pressures.6 A major interest of this researcher has long been the recruitment process and what factors influence the choice of library careers. During the 1960s, at a time when there was an acute shortage of librarians, I examined the personal characteristics and attitudes of a group of mid- western female undergraduate students who were considering librarian- ship as a career, and I also evaluated the effectiveness of various recruit- ment activities. Years later, in 1984, as the newly appointed chairperson of the Depart- ment of Library and Information Studies at Rutgers University, I was responsible for recruiting students during a time when many library schools were closing and others, such as Rutgers, had noticeably dwindling enrollments. I learned anew that the recruitment process demands care, imagination, aggression, and above all accurate informa- tion.8 Another longtime interest of the researcher was to examine data col- lected by the National Research Council (NRC) as it related to doctorate recipients in library science. While working as a research assistant for a 1970 study, Doctoral Education in New York State: Current Status and Projected Needs by Glenn E. Reeling, I discovered the value of these files and regularly examined NRC's publications. Unfortunately, it was never possible to learn much about our own doctorate recipients because the field of library and archival science is subsumed under other professional fields, and only very general information about the number of degrees granted annually is published. Many researchers, including Bowen as noted above, have looked at the academic labor market in general, or at large specialized segments such as engineering and science, and they commonly make use of NRC Fall 1992 313
Journal of Education for Library and Information Science data files. No one in our field, however, seems to have accessed NRC's doctorate recipient database. Only one study, conducted by Fay Zipkowitz and Elizabeth Futas, has attempted to collect data to assist in determining impending faculty replacement needs in our field. After having surveyed 627 faculty mem- bers (505 responded, and 231 reported on retirement plans) they devel- oped two models for predicting retirement. They concluded that "no matter which model represents the future, it looks bleak for recruitment of faculty members to teach in library schools."9 Whereas Futas and Zipkowitz were concerned with whether library and information studies education will experience critical faculty short- ages comparable to what is being projected for other fields, this research study is primarily interested in finding answers to the following ques- tions: How do trends in the production of doctorates in our field compare with the number of earned doctorates produced in other disciplines? Do doctorate recipients in our field take less or more time to complete their degrees? Is the percentage of our doctorate recipients who are planning to teach comparable to that found in other fields? What personal charac- teristics do our doctorate recipients share that would enable us to develop a profile of a potential recruit to a doctoral program in library and information science? Literature Review Because the field of library and information science is small and its doctoral programs are of relatively recent vintage, there is not a large body of literature to review. The first doctoral program was established at the University of Chicago in the 1928-29 academic year, and for the next twenty years, until the universities of Illinois and Michigan established their programs in 1948, Chicago was the sole institution to grant the Ph.D. degree. Columbia University established its doctoral program in 1952, California in 1955, Western Reserve in 1956, and Rutgers in 1959. In his comprehensive survey of "Doctoral Study in Librarianship in the United States," J. Periam Danton reviewed the early period and noted that through June 1959 Chicago awarded 89 degrees and the other schools combined totaled only 40 degrees. Among his findings, only 31 percent (n = 35) of the graduates actually held positions in library schools, with the remainder being employed primar- ily in academic libraries. He also reported that the major problem cited by deans and other academic leaders was "the inadequate number and amount of research grants, fellowships, and teaching assistantships for doctoral students."10 Another early survey of doctoral education in librarianship was con- ducted by Guy Marco in 1965. Marco's findings differed from Danton's in the area of placement. He reported that 59 doctoral recipients had accepted work in library school teaching, compared with 62 in academic 314 Volume 33, Number 4
Doctorate Recipients in Library Science library administration. (However, it is not entirely clear whether this is an accurate finding, since the University of Chicago did not report on its 97 graduates.) Graduates of the remaining six schools by 1965 numbered, as follows: California (w=l), Columbia (w=16), Illinois (rc = 31), Michigan (n = 50), Rutgers (n=16), and Western Reserve (, = 9)." The next major study was conducted by Ray L. and Patricia A. Carpenter in 1968 and published in 1970 under the title ' 'The Doctorate in Librarianship and an Assessment of Graduate Library Education." The study had two purposes: to describe selected socioeconomic vari- ables characterizing the doctoral population and to evaluate library education programs. Inspired in part by the Allan Cartter report, An Assessment of Quality in Graduate Education: A Study of Graduate Departments in 29 Academic Disciplines (American Council on Education, 1966), the Carpenters surveyed doctorate recipients in librarianship, deans of the forty- four library schools then in existence, and a random sample of one hundred library school faculty. They found that ' 'typically the doctorate is male, 'middle-aged,' from a professional or business family, and employed as an administrator." Thereby they concluded that (1) the inadequate number and the selective recruitment of doctorates suggest the need for greatly increased financial assistance for doctoral study, (2) recruitment for doctoral study should begin at a younger age, and (3) the present number of doctoral programs is not adequate. The more controversial aspect of their study, no doubt, was their ranking of doc- toral programs in which they determined Chicago, Illinois, Rutgers, and Columbia to be the top-ranked programs.12 Another study of interest to this researcher was conducted by Gail Schlachter and Dennis Thomison and titled "The Library Science Doc- torate: A Quantitative Analysis of Dissertations and Recipients." They examined 660 library science related dissertations completed at sixty- eight schools during the period 1925-1972. These dissertations included those completed for Ed.D. degrees and other degrees earned at non- ALA schools. The researchers collected biographical information for each of the recipients and also attempted to ascertain the length of time required to finish the dissertation.13 A number of researchers have noted that, although the professional field of librarianship has always had a large preponderance of women, until very recently women did not receive an equitable share of the doctorates. In Career Patterns of Librarians with Doctorates, Doris Dale iden- tified only three hundred women librarians with an earned doctorate. She then surveyed these women to elicit information about their personal and job-related characteristics, as well as to determine whether evidence of discrimination existed.14 In "Library School Faculty Doctorates: A Statistical Review," Ray- mond Kilpela found that the overall percentage of faculty members with Fall 1992 315
Journal of Education for Library and Information Science doctorates increased from 32.1 percent in 1960 to 65.9 percent in 1978 and that the number of schools granting doctorates in library science had grown to seventeen. He also pointed out that, whereas women held a majority of the positions in library schools in 1960, men constituted a majority of the faculty in 1978, as the doctorate rapidly became a requirement for academic employment.15 Since 1980 several relevant studies, including the aforementioned Futas/Zipkowitz research, have surfaced. George Bobinski's "Doctoral Programs in Library and Information Science in the United States and Canada" was intended (1) to trace the development of doctoral study, (2) to examine the current [1985] status of doctoral programs (n = 24), and (3) to provide personal insight into possible future developments. He concluded that doctoral study in library and information science was in a transition, with no new programs having been established for ten years and with three scheduled to be phased out. He also felt that library schools needed to do a better job in publicizing their doctoral programs. 16 George Whitbeck's research is an outgrowth of the Bobinski study, as well as an update to several of the earlier studies of doctoral education (Carpenter, Marco, and Danton). He recently resurveyed all of the library and information science schools with research doctoral degrees so that he could present a composite picture of doctoral programs. Sixteen schools, out of a possible twenty, responded. In his latest survey, Whit- beck found that the international student population increased in 1990 with some schools having a high percentage of international students. He also found more people with special library backgrounds coming into doctoral programs and a concomitant decline in students with academic, school, and public library experience. Respondents continued to cite "lack of monetary support for doctoral students" as their greatest problem.17 None of the researchers identified in this section has attempted to use nationally collected data to compare library science doctorate recipients with those in other disciplines. Research Objectives 1 . To determine any noticeable trends, during the past twenty years, in the annual number of doctoral degrees granted in library sci- ence, when compared with the number of doctoral degrees granted in other disciplines. 2 . To develop a profile of a doctorate recipient in library science and to determine how the characteristics of a library science doctorate recipient compare with the characteristics of doctorate recipients in other fields. Variables include (a) sex, (b) race, (c) citizenship, (d) median age at receipt of doctorate, (e) median length of time taken to complete the doctorate, (f) postdoctoral study plans, and (g) planned employment after doctorate. 316 Volume 33, Number 4
Doctorate Recipients in Library Science 3. To identify, for library science doctorate recipients only, the most popular fields of study and the most frequently attended institu- tions of higher education at the undergraduate and graduate levels. 4. To develop a profile of those doctorate recipients in library science who choose to teach, in comparison with those who choose to work in other areas (research and development, administration, or other professional services). Variables include (a) sex, (b) citizenship, (c) median length of time taken to complete the doctorate, and (d) debt accrued while completing the doctorate. 5 . To determine what administrators of doctoral programs in library and information science consider to be the major challenges facing them in regard to the recruitment and retention of doctoral stu- dents at their own institutions over the next five years. Sources of Data Those 1,253 library science doctorate recipients completing data forms for the National Research Council's annual Survey of Earned Doctor- ates (SED) during the period 1970-1990 were the major source of quanti- tative data. The SED has been conducted annually since 1958. Survey forms, distributed with the help of graduate deans of U.S. universities, are filled out by graduates as they complete the academic requirements for their doctorates. Summaries of the survey results have been pub- lished annually since 1967 in a series of reports titled Doctorate Recipients from United States Universities. Trends from earlier periods can be found in A Century of Doctorates: Data Analyses of Growth and Change (1978). Since so few doctorates are awarded in library and archival science, the area is subsumed under other professional fields in NRC's published reports. Consequently, only very general information about the number of library science doctoral degrees granted and the gender and race/ ethnicity of the recipients is provided annually. Thus, it was necessary to request a special tabulation from the National Research Council in order to access the full wealth of information collected by NRC for each library science doctorate recipient. One limitation to working with both NRC as well as U . S . Department of Education (USDE) data is that both agencies use the rubric library and archival science rather than library and information science. It is impossible to know how many of the doctorate recipients completing the NRC survey would consider themselves archivists. However, a closer examination of USDE data resulting from the National Center for Education Statistics' annual survey of all accredited institutions of higher education would suggest that an overwhelmingly large percentage of degrees are granted to recipients in library, rather than archival, science. Nonetheless, the waters are muddied when using all three (already collected) sources of data, namely NRC, USDE, and ALISE statistics. It is possible that some doctorate recipients completing the NRC survey would choose to Fall 1992 317

Further- more, we have differences between how degrees are counted - calendar year versus academic year; whether degrees are granted only by ALA schools or also by other U.S. institutions of higher education; and whether Canadian schools are included, as is the case with ALISE data. As can be seen in table 1, remarkable degrees of similarity exist between data reported to NRC and ALISE by the following schools: California-Berkeley, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, North Texas, Pitts- burgh, Texas Woman's, and North Carolina-Chapel Hill. On the other hand, other schools (e.g., Drexel, Rutgers, Syracuse, and Wisconsin- Madison) reported fewer doctorates to NRC than to ALISE, suggesting perhaps that their graduates may have elected to classify themselves in a field other than library science. Still other schools reported more 318 Volume 33, Number 4
Doctorate Recipients in Library Science doctorate recipients in library science to NRC than to ALISE, sug- gesting to this researcher two possibilities - either the schools had ceased reporting to ALISE because their library science programs had been discontinued (e.g., Case Western Reserve and Southern California) or school media specialists enrolled in education doctoral programs (e.g., Teachers College at Columbia University) chose to classify themselves under library science. The total number of degrees, w = 611 for the ALISE database (including 10 degrees granted by schools not regularly offering the doctorate and therefore not cited in the table) and n = 616 for the NRC database (including 9 degrees granted by other schools), is remarkably similar. The final source of information includes qualitative data resulting from interviews with those deans/directors responsible for administering library and information science doctoral programs. Twenty-one schools were identified as having active, continuing doctoral programs in 1991 : Alabama, State University of New York- Albany, California-Berkeley, Drexel, Florida State, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina-Chapel Hill, North Texas, Pittsburgh, Rutgers, Sim- mons, Syracuse, Texas, Texas Woman's, Toronto, Western Ontario, and Wisconsin-Madison. It was possible to interview nineteen deans/ directors representing twenty of these schools. (One individual re- sponded for both her present school and the one she had just left.) Arrangements were made to conduct interviews at either the ALISE or ALA conferences in 1991 ; two interviews also were held on the campuses of the respective schools. Recommendations for recruiting faculty, as outlined in American Professors: A National Resource Imperiled, were utilized in developing the interview instrument.1 Trends in Doctorate Production On the plus side, library and information science doctoral programs continue to be offered by six of the top ten largest doctoral degree granting institutions in the United States: California- Berkeley, Wisconsin-Madison, Illinois-Urbana, Texas- Austin, Michigan- Ann Arbor, and California-Los Angeles, a fact that needs repeated emphasis. The other four top ten doctorate-producing schools include Ohio State, Minnesota (which discontinued its library science program), Stanford, and MIT. Moreover, contrary to the doom-and- gloom atmosphere prevalent in library education, the number of library science doctorates awarded over the past twenty years generally has kept pace with doctoral produc- tivity in most other fields (see tables 2 and 3). The total number of doctorates produced in all disciplines peaked in 1973, followed by a gradual decline and then by almost a decade of stability. Only very recently (1989) did the number of doctorates produced annually (in all disciplines) begin again to increase. Fall 1992 319

Twenty years later, after numerous growth spurts and declines (the high point came in 1982 with 83 library science doctorates), 42 doctorates were awarded. In all, 1 ,253 library science doctorates were produced over the 20-year period. The number of library science doctorates produced annually continues to be incredibly small when compared to the total in other disciplines and professional fields. No doubt many would argue that the small size of library/information science programs, in combina- tion with the high percentage of women teaching in them, contributes to a lack of visibility and stature on research campuses. Characteristics of Library Science Doctorate Recipients Here is a look at some key findings that pertain to major differences between doctorate recipients in library science and those in other fields. Gender. It is no secret that graduates of library science doctoral pro- grams, in stark contrast to their academic cohorts in other disciplines, are overwhelmingly female. Table 4 illustrates that in 1970, 39 percent of library science doctorate recipients were female, compared to only 13.4 percent of the total number of doctorate recipients. By 1987, the percentage of women receiving doctorates in library science had risen to 79.2, in contrast to 35.2 percent of the total number (in all fields) and 320 Volume 33, Number 4

Figure 1, which portrays the percentage of females in four broad professional fields, again shows that library science has the greatest percentage of women doctorates, with the field of education being second. Race/Ethnicity. Some might say that there is still considerable room for improvement, but for the ten-year period 1981-1990, the field of library science had a significantly (p < 0.001)) higher percentage of doctorate recipients who were black (10.3 percent) than was the case for the total population of doctorate recipients (4.0 percent). No significant differ- ences existed for other racial/ethnic groups. Citizenship. There has been a decline in the number of doctoral degrees (in all fields) awarded to U.S. citizens. By 1990 only 67. 1 percent of the total population and 69 percent of the library science doctorates were conferred upon U.S. citizens, down respectively from a 20-year high of 84.2 percent (1970) and 94.6 percent (1974). Baccalaureate Fields. Library science doctorate recipients are atypical because they normally do not hold undergraduate degrees in library science. However, since 1970 the percentage of library science doctorate recipients with an undergraduate major in library science increased from a low of 2.4 percent (1970) to a high of 18.8 percent (1987), while at the same time the total for all doctorate recipients having a Fall 1992 321

As might be expected, given what we know about our M.L.S. population, more than half of the library science doctorate recipients were undergraduate humanities majors (52.2 percent), usually in language and literature (28.6 percent) and especially English (19.2 percent). This pattern has not changed over the years. Schools Attended by Doctorate Recipients at the Undergraduate and Graduate Levels. In all, 963 U.S. institutions and 233 foreign institutions awarded baccalaureate degrees to 1,211 library science doctorate recipients dur- ing the period 1970-1989. Indiana University not only is a major pro- ducer of library science doctorates, but it also is the leading institution attended by library science doctorate recipients at the undergraduate level (JV= 18). With the exception of the University of Minnesota, all ten of the top baccalaureate institutions attended by library science doctorate recipients currently have accredited M.L.S. programs. The remaining schools are Florida State, Michigan, California- Berkeley, North Texas, Illinois, Texas, Rutgers, and Clarion. Of more interest to this researcher, however, is that some of the leading undergraduate supplier schools do not have accredited library 322 Volume 33, Number 4
Doctorate Recipients in Library Science science programs (e.g., Kansas, City University of New York-Brooklyn, Colorado, Duquesne, Ohio State, Radcliffe, and CUNY-City College), thereby causing one to speculate how or why their graduates choose to study library science. Some historically black schools and small liberal arts colleges also count among their alumni a disproportionate number of doctorates in library science. Those schools producing the most library science doctorates since 1970 are, in rank order, Pittsburgh (n = 189), Florida State (n = 110), Columbia (rc=107), Indiana (n = 97), and Case Western Reserve (n = 93). While it is disheartening to note the demise of Case Western Reserve's library school and Columbia's school of library service, it is encouraging to see how quickly new programs can develop and produce relatively large numbers of doctorates, e.g., Texas Woman's, which in a very short time (1985-1989) grew to become the third largest producer of library science doctorates. Median Age. Library science doctorate recipients are considerably older than the total population of doctorate recipients, a fact that should come as no surprise since M.L.S. students also are mature. Approxi- mately one-eighth of the graduates are past age 50 by the time they complete their degrees. In 1990 the median age for a library science doctorate recipient was 41.5. For the total population it was 33.9. Figure 2 portrays age data for doctorate recipients in four broad professional fields. Median Time from Baccalaureate to Doctorate. Library science doctorate recipients also require more time to complete the doctorate. Table 5 shows that, since 1970, registered time for library science doctorate recipients has ranged from 6.38 to 8.88 years, whereas the total popula- tion (all fields) completed their doctorates in 5.6 to 7 years. On average, Figure 1 . Percentage of female doctorate recipients in library science and by broad professional field, 1983-1990. Fall 1992 323
Journal of Education for Library and Information Science Figure 2. Median age for doctorate recipients in library science and by broad professional field, 1983-1990. library science doctorate recipients received their degrees 14.25 to 19 years after their baccalaureates, in contrast to 7.9 to 10.5 years for the total population. What role part-time study plays in the longer time needed by library science doctorate recipients to complete degrees can only be speculated. Postdoctoral Activity. In comparison with other doctorate recipients, only a small percentage of library science doctorate recipients plan post- doctoral study. For example, in 1990, 17 percent of the total population had made postdoctoral commitments to continue their studies, in com- parison with only 2.4 percent of the library science doctorate recipients. Indeed, at no time during the past twenty years did the percentage of library science doctorate recipients committed to postdoctoral study rise above 5.3 percent, and in six of these years there was not even one graduate with a postdoctoral commitment to study. On the other hand, library science doctorate recipients usually had definite postdoctoral employment commitments by the time they gradu- ated. In comparison with other fields, our graduates have an extremely high rate of postdoctoral employment, ranging from 81.8 percent in 1980 to a low of 61.9 percent in 1990, the same year in which the lowest percentage of graduates in many fields were able to make definite postdoctoral employment commitments prior to graduation. The high rate of postdoctoral employment for library science doctorate recipients surpassed even that of computer science and engineering doctorate re- cipients. Only graduates in the field of business and management had higher rates of postdoctoral employment for most of the years surveyed. Type of Employment. More library science doctorate recipients planned to work in educational institutions than was the case for the total popula- 324 Volume 33, Number 4

However, in recent years there has been a slight shift from an educational institution employment setting toward that of industry/business for both groups. From a high of 90.3 percent in 1981, the percentage of library science doctorate recipients planning to work in an educational institution had dropped to 71.4 percent in 1990. Note, however, that not all of these individuals planned to teach. In 1990, 35.1 percent of the library science doctorate recipients had chosen to teach, while 16.2 percent were commited to administrative work and another 16.2 percent listed professional service as their area of intended work. Profile of a Doctorate Recipient Who Chooses to Teach There is definite cause for concern that fewer and fewer library science doctorate recipients elect teaching as their primary postdoctoral employ- ment commitment. The proportion of library science doctorate recipi- ents choosing to teach has dropped significantly (p < 0.001) over the 20-year period. Since the mid-70s, the percentage of women choosing to teach has not declined as much as that of their male colleagues. During the most recent period for which data are available, 1985-1989, 62 women (or 37.3 percent of the total pool of women receiving library Fall 1992 325

Figure 3 shows that international graduates of our library science doctoral programs are now significantly more committed to teaching than U.S. citizens (p < 0.001). In the period 1985-1989, 28 graduates, or two-thirds of the library science doctorate recipients with temporary visas, had postdoctoral commitments to teach. Library science doctorate recipients planning to teach take less time to complete their doctorates. For the five-year period, 1985-1989, the difference was significant (p <0.05) for both registered (7.29 versus 8 . 84) and total (16.56 versus 18.35) years . A significantly larger percent- age (p <0.01 in 1988)) of those library science doctorate recipients planning to teach were without debt. It is tempting to speculate that those with debt are forced to choose more lucrative careers. What the Deans and Directors Have to Say Deans and directors were almost unanimous in their belief that there is a shortage of doctorate recipients in library and information science. Nonetheless, for a variety of reasons, there was little expectation of major enrollment growth at their respective institutions over the next five years. Deans and directors ranked, in order of importance, the following factors as most important in influencing students to select their doctoral programs: (1) quality of faculty, (2) reputation of program, (3) geographic location, (4) familiarity with the school, and (5) interdisci- plinary nature of the program. Although there were noticeable differences in the amount of money each school had available for student support, a lack of such funding generally was seen as the major deterrent in recruitment of full-time students, and it also resulted, in their opinion, in the loss of some ABDs 326 Volume 33, Number 4
Doctorate Recipients in Library Science who found it necessary to accept full-time employment and then failed to complete their dissertations. Lack of availability of research funds also made it difficult to expose Ph.D. students to the research process. Indeed, over and over the administrators cited adequate finances as the biggest challenge impacting their doctoral programs in the next five years. Recruitment and retention of quality faculty was cited as the number two challenge. Reasons attributed to a declining interest in a teaching career ranged from the most popular, starting salaries are too low for our mature graduates with years of professional experience, to concern that students see too many of the problems associated with the tenure process. Also, at those schools lacking undergraduate programs in library and information science, adminis- trative barriers erected by the graduate schools often made it next to impossible for doctoral students to get actual classroom experience teach- ing in the M.L.S. program. Some Recommendations 1 . For future planning, it would be desirable to have a longitudinal survey of library science doctorate recipients in order to track their employment and research records. Such longitudinal surveys are regularly conducted by the National Research Council, but library science doctorate recipients are no longer included. 2 . ALISE might also consider conducting an annual placement survey, including salary information, of new doctorate recipients, with special emphasis on identification of factors influencing their choice of employment and/or postdoctoral study. The survey should also seek to elicit salary information. 3 . A more concerted effort needs to be made to secure funded research opportunities that will permit both faculty and doctoral students to work in an exciting research environment. Likewise, opportuni- ties to participate in interdisciplinary research on individual cam- puses need to be explored in a concerted effort to place in the mainstream faculty/students and to make small library and infor- mation science programs visible. If research, with a practical appli- cation, was supported by state and local libraries, the resulting funds could also help to support a doctoral student and allow that student to attend school on a full-time basis. Finally, opportunities for postdoctoral study - both for students and faculty - need to be developed. 4. Library and information science faculty need to convince promis- ing M.L.S. students to enter doctoral programs earlier, rather than after years of professional experience. One recommendation would be to encourage library schools to identify their best and brightest prospects for Ph.D. study while the students are still completing their M.L.S. degrees. Faculty followup and mentoring Fall 1992 327
Journal of Education for Library and Information Science might be conducive in persuading these students to enter a doctoral program, especially since deans and directors are convinced that personal contact with M. L. S. students and alumni is the most effective method to recruit doctoral students. 5. Faculty must find ways to reduce the amount of time library and information science doctoral students spend in graduate study, unless library schools want to continue their record of having ma- ture alumni who take the most time to complete their degrees. 6. To encourage doctorate recipients to teach, ways must be found to involve them in the teaching process. For instance, a three-hour session on ' 'Considering Teaching as a Career" might be made a requirement of the doctoral program. Students also need faculty mentors to help them develop as teachers. In those campuses where graduate school regulations prohibit Ph.D. students from teaching at the master's level, and where the library school does not have an undergraduate program, faculty should consider aggressively seeking opportunities for their doctoral students to teach courses in information handling or information literacy for other schools on campus. Doctoral students also might teach in the university library's bibliographic instruction program. References and Notes 1. B. B. Moran, ' 'ALISE: Can (Greying) Faculty Shape Policy?

NASIG Conference Grant Awards The North American Serials Interest Group (NASIG) is currently seeking candi- dates for grants to attend the eighth annual conference, to be held at Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, June 10-13, 1993. NASIG is an independent organization bringing together many segments of the serials information chain to study and explore common interests, problems, and ideas. Through the granting of these awards, the organization seeks to encourage participation in this information chain by students who are interested in pursuing some aspect of serials work upon completion of their professional degree. Students currently enrolled full-time or part-time at the graduate level in an ALA-accredited library school and who have expressed interest in serials or tech- nical services work are eligible to apply. The applicant cannot already have an ALA-accredited degree and cannot be employed, or on leave, from a position requiring such a degree. Preference will be given to those applicants who are graduating in 1993. The grant award consists of funds sufficient to pay for travel, conference registra- tion, meals, and lodging. Recipients are expected to attend the entire conference and to submit a brief written report to NASIG. Application forms will be available after January 15, 1993, in ALA-accredited library schools, and from Harriet Kersey, chair of the Library Science Student Grant Committee. Completed applications should be sent to Harriet Kersey, Assistant Head, Infor- mation Control and Management, Georgia Tech Library, Atlanta, Georgia 30332-0900. Applications must be received by March 1, 1993. Award recipients will be notified by April 15, 1993. Up to six grants may be awarded. Fall 1992 329
