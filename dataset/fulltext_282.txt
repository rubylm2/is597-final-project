Dodging the Debate and Dealing with the Facts: Using Research and the Public Library to Promote Understanding of the Affordable Care Act Andrea Tanner, Otis L. Owens, Diana Sisson, Vance Kornegay, Caroline D. Bergeron, Daniela B. Friedman, Megan Weis, and Lee Patterson ABSTRACT This study reports on an innovative, community-based effort to promote awareness and under- standing of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) through a public library system in one southeastern county. Specifically, this study assesses the current knowledge, perceptions, and communication sources and needs regarding the ACA among adults in one southeastern county in an effort to determine the feasibility of establishing the public library as a trusted and nonpartisan source of ACA-related information. Results of formative research are discussed, and campaign develop- ment activities are chronicled. Findings indicate that public libraries can serve as a hub of infor- mation on important health-related issues through their efforts to communicate with, educate, and engage with the communities they serve. T he Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) became law on March 23, 2010,with the majority of provisions related to expansion of health care coverage enactedJanuary 1, 2014 (US Department of Health and Human Services 2015). The legislation is considered the most significant change in the American health care system since Medicaid and Medicare were enacted in 1965 (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2015), and experts suggest that the law will ultimately result in health insurance coverage for 94% of Americans, reducing the number of uninsured by 31 million people (Rosenbaum 2011). The ACA promotes access to care and strengthens consumer protections, building upon the prevention and wellness objectives established by Healthy People, the national objectives released every 10 years with the goal of improving the health of Americans (Healthy People This research was funded by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. We are grateful to Padgett Mozingo (Richland Library) for her support and assistance.

Promoting Understanding of the Affordable Care Act • 173 2020 2010; Fielding, Teutsch, and Koh 2012). One of the key provisions of the ACA is the requirement that all Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty. To help consumers find health insurance, health insurance marketplaces were created, and initial enrollment through the marketplaces took place between October 2013 and March 2014 (Parker, Her- nandez, and Wu 2013). Despite the barrage of advertisements, public service announce- ments, and news stories about the ACA and the looming deadline for purchasing coverage through the marketplace, research suggests that many Americans are confused about the ACA and lack the information they need to make informed decisions about their health and their health insurance coverage (Green 2013; Parker et al. 2013; Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation 2014b). The impact of the ACA hinges on the idea that the eligible uninsured will purchase coverage (Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation 2014a). Thus, communication and outreach efforts are crucially important to enrollment and, ultimately, decreasing the number of people without health insurance. To raise awareness and knowledge about the ACA, effective com- munication is critical. Health communication, a priority of Healthy People 2020, provides the context for how professionals and the public search for, understand, and use health infor- mation, significantly impacting their health decisions and actions (Healthy People 2020 2010). It is well documented that targeted, evidence-based media campaigns can have significant effects on health knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors (Randolph and Viswanath 2004; Escobar-Chaves et al. 2005; Bauman et al. 2006; Noar 2006; Snyder 2007; Sharpe et al. 2010; Hennink-Kaminski, Willoughby, and McMahan 2014). The federal government and other health-related organizations have developed media campaigns and other educational materials designed to inform the general public about the ACA. For example, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (2013) developed promo- tional materials that local organizations can distribute and sponsored ads nationally. Nonprofit groups such as the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation (2013b) produced short videos and other materials that local groups can share through Web pages and social media. However, the vast majority of outreach and educational work in most states is conducted by state and local organizations, some supported by materials from national affiliations with advocacy groups (e.g., AARP or the American Cancer Society). Community-based or geographically targeted campaigns, however, may be more effective than national efforts, particularly if the source is a trusted, locally known organization or resource (Hennink-Kaminski et al. 2013). Seth Noar, C. N. Benac, and M. S. Harris (2007) found that tailored, or customized, health-related messages were an effective strategy for capturing the attention of interested publics and made the subject matter more “personally relevant” (684). For example, a recent discussion paper published by the Institute of Medicine (Patel et al. 2013) highlighted the prevailing confusion surrounding the ACA and the information- seeking needs of health consumers, particularly those who are medically underserved. The
174 • The Library Quarterly authors pointed out the importance of using and providing resources for grassroots com- munity outreach. Widespread dissemination of community-created messages about the ACA was also outlined as an important strategy for increasing ACA awareness (Patel et al. 2013). Public libraries are situated to serve as hubs of information and engagement leaders in the communities they serve (Gollop 1997; Parker and Kreps 2005; Kwon and Kim 2009; Peterson 2014). Uniquely positioned as a neutral, trusted institution with the goal of bringing people together to participate in shared learning, public libraries are increasingly integrating com- munity engagement into their core services and building strategic partnerships and alliances to reach their constituents (Beard, De Vekey, and Ball 2003; Kranich 2005; Parker and Kreps 2005; Willingham 2008; Bertot 2010; Flaherty 2013). Although there is an overall lack of understanding about ACA provisions nationally (Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation 2014b), lack of awareness and confusion regarding the ACA may be even more pronounced in some states where the legislature and state health agency leaders have not created a state-specific health insurance exchange, are opting out of Medicaid expansion, and have yet to develop a long-term strategic plan for Medicaid expansion (Holleman 2012; Henry J. Kaiser Family Foun- dation 2014a). Purpose This article reports on the development of an innovative partnership among an 11-branch, countywide public library system with more than 215,000 library-card holders; an academic institution; and a nonpartisan health policy institute to promote awareness and understanding of the ACA to residents living in one southeastern county: Richland County, South Carolina. Specifically, this article focuses on the formative research, communication efforts, and devel- opment of promotional materials to (a) establish the public library as a trusted and nonpar- tisan source of ACA-related information and (b) encourage Richland County residents with- out health insurance coverage to seek information from the library by the March 31, 2014, open-enrollment deadline about purchasing coverage through the health insurance mar- ketplaces established by the ACA. Formative research findings would also be used after the March 31, 2014, insurance marketplace deadline to develop messages to educate stakeholders in the county and other areas of the state about ACA provisions. From a theoretical standpoint, this project is guided by social marketing, which is defined as the systematic application of commercial marketing techniques to influence the behavior of target audiences to improve their welfare and that of society (Andreason 1995). Social mar- keting has been used effectively to guide marketing and message development for health programs (Friedman et al. 2012), stresses the importance of formative research (Grier and Bryant 2005), and includes the marketing mix of the four Ps (identifying strategies for mar- keting the product; price, or cost to consumers; place of program activities; and promotion, or
Promoting Understanding of the Affordable Care Act • 175 marketing techniques to reach target audiences) (Friedman et al. 2009). Developing partnerships has been considered a fifth P of the social marketing mix (Nichols et al. 2004). Research Questions The campaign development process began with formative research to assess the current knowledge, perceptions, and communication sources and needs regarding the ACA among adults in Richland County, South Carolina, a county with approximately 399,256 residents, of whom 17.1% live below the poverty line (US Census Bureau 2013). Researchers were also in- terested in determining the feasibility of establishing the public library as a source of ACA- related information. It has long been demonstrated that residents in the state of South Car- olina experience significant health disparities (Adams et al. 2006; Adams et al. 2009; “Burden of Diabetes in South Carolina” 2009; Hebert et al. 2009; “The Burden of Heart Disease and Stroke in South Carolina” 2010; Cavicchia et al. 2013; Division of Chronic Disease Epidemiology 2014) such as lower rates of health insurance, lower socioeconomic and educational status, and cul- tural and social differences contributing to these disparities (South Carolina Rural Health Re- search Center 2008; Health Sciences South Carolina 2010). In Richland County, 45% of the population is non-Hispanic African American, and 5% is Hispanic; 20% of adults aged 18–65 are uninsured (County Health Rankings and Roadmaps 2013). To evaluate what people know about the ACA and to develop strategies for communicating this information, the following research questions were developed: 1. What are Richland County residents’ level of awareness and understanding of the ACA? 2. What are Richland County residents’ perceptions of the ACA? 3. From what sources do Richland Country residents receive information about the ACA? 4. What are the most effective communication strategies for delivering information about the ACA to Richland County residents? 5. What is the feasibility of using the public library to educate Richland County residents about the ACA? Method Data for this study were collected through a randomized telephone survey of 509 Richland County, South Carolina, residents. Dual sampling-frame approach, one based on landline tele- phone exchanges and the second based on a list of cell-phone exchanges, was used in selecting respondents for this study, as 37% of adults in the state of South Carolina live in wireless-only households (Blumberg et al. 2013). Each contact was made using random-digit dialing. When contact was made with a residence in the landline component, a respondent 18 years of age or older was randomly chosen from the household’s occupants, based on who had the next
176 • The Library Quarterly birthday. The interviewee was also required to live in Richland County and to have not par- ticipated in any recent information sessions at his or her local library to learn about the ACA. When contact was made with an individual through a cell phone, he or she was asked a series of questions to determine eligibility, which included confirming (a) that the number reached was for a cell phone and (b) that the individual who answered was 18 years of age or older, a resident of Richland County, and had not participated in the aforementioned ACA informa- tion sessions offered by his or her local library. The telephone surveys were conducted by a public survey research institute at the authors’ university. The main survey period was from October 18 to November 26, 2013. The response rate was 24.4% for the landline component and 12.9% for the cell-phone component. The overall re- sponse rate was 21.8%. The final sample comprised 356 landline (70%) and 153 (30%) cell-phone users. Cognitive interviews with African American and White males and females were carried out using a draft of the questionnaire. After finalizing the questionnaire, pretesting of the survey by telephone was conducted, and minor changes were made to the questionnaire be- fore administering the survey. The Institutional Review Board at the authors’ university ap- proved the survey instrument. Measurement Understanding of the ACA Respondents’ perceived understanding of the ACA was measured using one original item created by the research team (“Howwell do you understand the ACA?”). Responses ranged from “Extremely well” to “Not at all.” A similar item was adopted from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation’s April 2013 Health Tracking Poll (2013a) to determine whether respondents had enough information to understand how the ACA would affect their families. The responses for this item were “Yes, I have enough information,” “No, I do not have enough information,” or “I don’t know.” Perceptions of the ACA Two questions, adapted from the Kaiser Family Foundation’s April 2013 Health Tracking Poll (2013a), were used to measure respondents’ perceptions of the ACA. The first question asked whether respondents had a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the ACA, and the second sought respondents’ opinions regarding six specific facts about the ACA (e.g., “The law allows children to stay on their parents’ insurance plans until the age of 26”). The response options for both questions included a 5-point scale, which ranged from “Very unfavorable” to “Very favorable.” However, for the purposes of our analysis (to determine overall perception of the ACA), we combined the six ACA responses from the second question into an index (a = 0.740).
Promoting Understanding of the Affordable Care Act • 177 Knowledge of the ACA We included nine questions focused on knowledge of the ACA, which were also adapted from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation’s April 2013 Health Tracking Poll (2013a). The item in- cluded nine statements about the ACA, three of which were false (e.g., “The law cuts benefits for people in the traditional Medicare program”). Responses for each statement were “Yes, the law does do this,” “No, the law does not do this,” or “Don’t know/refused.” To determine residents’ overall knowledge about the ACA, items were combined into an index (a = 0.742) where each correct item was worth 1 point with a maximum of 9 points. Sources for ACA Information Three items from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation’s April 2013 Health Tracking Poll (2013a) were used to determine the sources used to acquire ACA information, including (a) how often a respondent uses various sources to receive ACA information (“Never,” “Rarely,” “Sometimes,” “Often,” or “Very often”), (b) the most important channel for ACA information, and (c) whether the respondent’s primary source of ACA information was providing mostly positive or mostly negative information about the ACA. To obtain responses, 17 sources were mentioned to the participant, such as “Cable TV,” “Local TV,” “Social media,” “Your doctor,” “Conversations with friends and family,” or “Your employer.” Three additional items, created by the research team, were included to determine the likelihood that respondents would seek out information about the ACA over the next 6 months, their likelihood of using the library as a source for ACA information, and the effectiveness of various sources and channels for disseminating ACA information. The first two items used 5-point scales ranging from “Very unlikely” to “Very likely.” The third item listed each source (e.g., “Local radio”) separately and required respondents to provide a response on a 5-point scale that ranged from “Not at all effective” to “Extremely effective.” Demographic Variables Age, gender, education, income, employment, ethnicity, political ideology, and insurance cov- erage were collected. Prior to our analysis, we collapsed responses in demographic categories in order to eliminate categories with few respondents. Education was categorized as “High school,” “Some college,” or “College and above. ” Income was categorized using a 4-point scale (1 = less than $20,000, 2 = $20,000–$49,999, 3 = $50,000–$99,999, 4 = $100,000+) that repre- sented the amount of family income in 2013 before taxes. Employment was categorized on a 4-point scale that included “Employed,” “Unemployed,” “Retired,” or “Student.” Respondents’ insurance status (i.e., insured or uninsured) and self-reported political ideology (i.e., conserva- tive, moderate, or liberal) were also collected.
178 • The Library Quarterly Analysis In addition to descriptive statistics, we ran mean comparisons and one-way ANOVAs to examine any associations between our primary dependent variables (i.e., ACA knowledge, ACA perceptions) and independent variables (i.e., demographic characteristics). All associations were considered significant at p < 0.05. IBM SPSS 21 (IBM Corp. 2012) was used to analyze all data. Findings As the primary objectives of this research were twofold, the project was conducted in two phases. First, survey data were collected in order to evaluate what people know and think about the ACA. Next, findings from the survey informed the development of strategies for communicating ACA information to the public. Study findings are reported in a similar fash- ion. First, survey results are presented; then concept development and communication strat- egies are presented. Survey Results Of the 509 survey respondents, the mean age was 46.01 ± 20.14. A majority were non-White (52%, n = 250), female (51%, n = 261), had health insurance (91%, n = 447), and were employed (61%, n = 313). Survey participants, on average, had some college education (M = 2.25, SD = 0.80), had household incomes of $50,000–$99,999 (M = 2.70; SD = 0.91), and had moderate political views (M = 1.82; SD = 0.82). Forty percent (n = 204) reported their employer as their main source of health insurance. Awareness and Understanding of the ACA The first research question examined Richland County residents’ self-reported awareness and factual knowledge of the ACA and access to information about the ACA. The majority reported that they understand the law either somewhat well (40.5%, n = 206) or not at all (21.3%, n = 108). Just less than half (43.0%, n = 211) reported that they did not have enough informa- tion to understand the law. Actual knowledge was also evaluated. The average score on a 9-item quiz was 5.21 out of 9 points. One-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests found significant differences among the mean knowledge scores of respondents when analyzed by contextual, or demographic, variables. As shown in table 1, respondents with the lowest ACA knowledge scores had conservative views (M = 4.76), were unemployed (M = 4.64), were between the ages of 18 and 26 (M = 4.57), had incomes below $20,000 (M = 4.45), had no insurance (M = 4.44), and had a high school or less than high school education (M = 4.27). On the other hand, respondents who: had incomes of $100,000 or more (M = 6.28), had a college degree or above (M = 5.70), were retired (M = 5.61),

180 • The Library Quarterly were ages 45–64 (M = 5.54), and/or had insurance (M = 5.38) had the highest mean knowledge scores. There were no statistically significant differences observed for ACA knowledge based on race or sex. Perceptions of the ACA The second research question examined general opinions and overall perception of the ACA. Residents reported having a favorable (43%, n = 218) or neutral (20.5%, n = 104) opinion of the ACA. Results from an assessment of their opinions on specific aspects of the ACA (where 5 is very unfavorable and 1 is very favorable) also revealed that residents on average (M = 2.40) had a favorable view of the law. As shown in table 1, one-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests found that perceptions of the law significantly differed by political ideology and race. More specifically, non-Whites (M = 2.13) had a more favorable opinion of the ACA than Whites (M = 2.70), and residents with liberal views (M = 2.00) had a more favorable opinion of the ACA than those with conservative views (M = 2.70). Respondents received ACA information from a variety of sources (e.g., TV, family, Internet, radio), but their most-used sources for ACA information were cable, national network, and local television news (54.0%, n = 274), conversations with friends and family (8%, n = 38), social media (6%, n = 33), and newspapers (6%, n = 32). Few respondents said they received infor- mation from their doctor (0.2%, n = 1) or the Internet (2%, n = 13). Information sources did not vary significantly by race, age, sex, income, or employment. Almost 60%, (n = 495) of the residents reported that their most important source had reported mostly negative information about the ACA. There were no significant differences in residents’ perceptions of ACA by source. Those who reported friends and family (M = 3.07) as their most-used source of ACA information, however, had significantly lower knowledge scores than residents who reported other sources (F = 13.13, df = (38, 456), p = <.0001). Most Effective Communication Strategies Respondents were also asked what they believed were the most effective means of commu- nicating ACA information. The five most effective means reported were doctors or local health care providers (53%, n = 268), local television news (48%, n = 242), employer (47%, n = 241), social media (47%, n = 237), and churches (41%, n = 206). The least effective methods were telephone calls (18%, n = 92) and text messages (17%, n = 89). ACA Information Seeking More than half (53%, n = 271) of respondents said they will seek information about the ACA within the next 6 months. One-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests found that respondents who were 18–26 (M = 2.56) and 65+ (M = 2.86) (F = 6.75, df = (3, 477), p = .0001) or students/
Promoting Understanding of the Affordable Care Act • 181 retirees (M = 2.92, F = 3.80, df = (3, 482), p = .01), however, were significantly less likely than other residents to report that they would search for information on the ACA in the next 6 months (see table 1). Half (50%, n = 252) also reported that they would be very likely or likely to seek ACA information from their local library. One-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests found that unemployed residents (M = 3.80, F = 4.70, df = (3, 487), p = .001) and/or those with incomes less than $20,000 (M = 3.80, F = 3.00, df = (3, 418), p = .0001) were significantly more likely than other groups to seek ACA information from the library. Concept Development and Communication Strategies Survey results revealed that Richland County residents are actively seeking ACA information and see the library as a place to find ACA resources. Specifically, more than half (53%) of Richland County residents who responded to our survey indicated that they would be seeking ACA information in the next 6 months, and half (50%) also said they would be likely or very likely to use library resources to seek this information. Further, lower-income Richland County residents and those who are unemployed (residents who are more likely to need ACA infor- mation and who are often active library patrons) were significantly more likely to say they would seek ACA information from the library. Surprisingly, residents (63%) reported having a positive or neutral perception of the ACA, despite the fact that they reside in a state where the legislature and state agencies do not support the law (Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation 2014a), and nearly 60% reported receiving mostly negative information from their primary communication sources about the ACA. Finally, more than 4 of 10 Richland County residents (43%) said they do have enough infor- mation to understand the law, a finding that is consistent with results from national surveys on ACA understanding and perceptions (Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation 2013a, 2014b). These findings, along with other results from the formative research, guided the devel- opment of a plan to raise overall awareness of the ACA in Richland County and make residents aware of the information and assistance available through Richland Library and community partners. A secondary aim was to target Richland County residents still without health in- surance coverage and encourage them to seek information from the library by the March 31, 2014, enrollment deadline. The campaign took place between February 15 and March 31, 2014. Key components of the campaign included partnerships, communication strategies to reach target audiences, and library-focused ACA events, outreach, and promotion. Strategic ACA Partnerships Before launching the ACA promotional campaign, the library identified an employee as a community engagement project coordinator to oversee the communication and education
182 • The Library Quarterly efforts regarding the ACA. Next, partnerships were developed between the Richland Library and approximately 30 community organizations, including local government; advocacy groups; health care providers; and other service organizations, such as the Columbia Housing Authority, the United Way of the Midlands, the South Carolina Primary Health Care Association, and the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). Representatives of these organizations now serve on a community engagement team facilitated by a nonpartisan health policy institute that provides insight into the needs and perspectives of the community in order to inform the research and work of the project. Participants provide critical insights into the community, identify resources available to disseminate messages, and further enhance implementation of communication plans. Communication Strategies to Reach Target Audiences Focus-group findings reported elsewhere (Bergeron et al. 2014) suggested that residents value health-related information that they receive through interpersonal communication, particu- larly face-to-face communication with a local resident who is familiar with issues in the com- munity. As a result, we personalized the concept by promoting the community engagement project coordinator as the “face” and “voice” of ACA information at Richland Library. As illus- trated in figure 1, we linked this personal approach into a series of appeals related to informing residents how they could meet the March 31 deadline, avoid fines, and qualify for subsidies under the tagline “Richland Library has you covered.” With a limited budget, the overall marketing strategy was a mix of earned, or “free”media, as well as paid media. Some tactics were developed to specifically target residents without health insurance and encourage them to seek information from the library by the March 31, 2014, enrollment deadline. As survey results indicated that more than half (54%) of Richland county residents used local television news as a primary source of ACA information, and 48% perceived local news to be one of the most effective means of communicating about the ACA, one of our primary tactics focused on garnering news coverage from local television news stations and partnering with stations to better communicate with the public about the ACA. Finally, all events and efforts were promoted in the 11 Richland Library branches and on the library’s website in an effort to reach engaged, active library users. Paid Media Flyers (see fig. 1) were inserted into utility bills mailed to 120,000-plus households in the city of Columbia. Flyers were also directly mailed to residents in areas of the county (identified by zip code) where census data indicated that a large number of residents are uninsured (Missouri Census Data Center 2012). Both targeted mailings (utility bill and direct mail) occurred be- tween March 10 and March 24 in anticipation of the March 31 deadline. Flyers (a total of 6,000)

184 • The Library Quarterly were also printed and distributed at the area’s Mardi Gras celebration and were available at all library locations and outreach events. Paid Newspaper Advertisements In-kind ads in the region’s daily newspaper (weekday circulation 64,855, Sunday circulation 123,064) (South Carolina Press Association 2013) were developed (full-page, quarter-page, and banner ads), and two designs, with a look and theme similar to those of the flyers, were created. Nine ads ran between February 20 and March 19, with the promise of several more to be published by the March 31 deadline. Library call logs through March 23 indicated that the newspaper ads and the mailing inserts were the most-often-cited sources for how callers had heard about the library as a source of ACA information. Earned Local Television News Coverage Outreach to broadcast media began on March 17. Specifically, we used findings from the formative research and the upcoming ACA deadline to generate news stories. The library’s community engagement project coordinator, as the “face” of the campaign, appeared on sev- eral news broadcasts and on City TV, the city’s government access station that serves as a com- munication tool to provide information to the community at large. A partnership with a local television station with the largest viewership in the region was formed so that an on-air phone bank could take place during the afternoon and evening news broadcast on March 27, 2014. The purpose of the phone bank was to answer viewers’ questions about the ACA and to promote the library’s ACA expertise. Another library partner, the AARP, volunteered to help “man” the phone bank, and the library’s community engagement project coordinator answered ACA-related questions during a live interview with local news broad- casters during the newscast. More than 300 phone calls were received during this event, with the television news workers indicating that it “was the busiest phone bank the news station had ever held.” As survey results revealed that 47% of respondents identified social media as an effective manner in which to reach residents about the ACA, television news personalities were also encouraged to post library Web links and ACA information on their professional social media sites. Library-Focused ACA Events, Outreach, and Promotion The library, along with several partner organizations from the engagement team, held a series of three enrollment and outreach events during which attendees could meet with navigators and certified application counselors or use the library’s computers to enroll in an insurance plan. Other events included community forums (with volunteer speakers from the engage- ment team), lunch seminars with community groups, and an event with representatives of
Promoting Understanding of the Affordable Care Act • 185 each company offering plans on the marketplace answering consumer questions. News cov- erage of these events was featured across the three local television news stations in the media market and published in print/online media in the region (i.e., the State, the Columbia Star, SC Black News, and Coladaily.com). Further, library branches throughout the county began hosting federally certified navigators to assist with enrollment. Patrons met with navigators as walk- ins, or they could set up an appointment in advance. Library In-House Promotion The Richland Library also reached out to its 206,777 registered patrons through communi- cation channels already in place at the library. For example, ACA information was distributed to 12,000 library patrons who subscribe to a monthly e-mailed electronic newsletter. A pro- motional sign was prominently displayed in all 11 library branches, and 10,000 fliers were distributed to patrons at these branches. As survey results revealed that 47% of residents perceived social media to be an effective channel to distribute ACA information, the library exploited its social media channels by providing regular posts to Facebook and Twitter that resulted in engagement among library patrons. The library also featured the “avoid penalties” appeal as the dominant visual in the header of its website in the weeks before the deadline (see fig. 2). From its inception, the library’s ACA web page garnered 7,286 views. Figure 2. Richland Library website promotion
186 • The Library Quarterly Discussion Communicating with and educating the public about the ACA can help combat numerous health disparities in the state through encouraging enrollment in insurance plans that can provide coverage for preventive care and treatment. Findings from this study clearly indicate that public libraries can serve as a hub of information on important health-related issues as another way to communicate with, educate, and engage with the residents in the commu- nities they serve. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to report on the development of an innovative community partnership and to disseminate the results of formative research conducted to promote awareness and understanding of the ACA in a local community. The widespread dissemination of community-created messages about the ACA has been outlined as an important strategy for increasing ACA awareness (Patel et al. 2013). Preliminary results from this campaign suggest that promoting a trusted local institution such as the public library as a place to receive ACA information and providing a personal contact whom residents believe to be trustworthy and knowledgeable and who shares similar ideas and viewpoints were effective strategies to market ACA expertise and knowledge. For example, after the deployment of the water-bill inserts, direct mail, ACA print ads, and television in- terviews that prominently featured the community engagement project manager, phone calls to the library from residents seeking ACA information increased exponentially, from an aver- age of 2 phone calls per day to more than 60. Call logs indicated that the newspaper ads and the mailing inserts were the most-often-cited sources for how callers had heard about the library as a source of ACA information. On-site visits to the library also increased, and the library experienced a shortage of ACA-trained navigators in the days preceding the market- place deadline. Findings from this study therefore concur with previous research suggesting that community- based or geographically targeted campaigns may be more effective than national efforts (Hennink-Kaminski et al. 2014). Findings are also in line with the social marketing literature and other health campaign literature stressing the importance of formative research in an effort to understand the knowledge, perceptions, and communication needs of a target audience (Noar 2006; Noar, Benac, and Harris 2007; Friedman et al. 2012; Friedman et al. 2013; Hennink-Kaminski et al. 2014; Tanner et al. 2015). Survey results from Richland County resi- dents were crucial when developing the key messages and communication strategies and allowed the researchers to better understand and respond to the public’s attitudes and under- standing of the ACA (Comis et al. 2003). There are limitations to this study that should be noted. First, survey respondents were from one county in South Carolina, and results are therefore not generalizable at the national or state level. Second, survey responses were collected in October and November 2013, a time when there was an abundance of news reports focused on (a) Republican politicians de- manding that the ACA law be repealed and (b) widespread problems accessing the ACA
Promoting Understanding of the Affordable Care Act • 187 marketplace enrollment website (healthcare.gov). These reports could have influenced re- spondents’ understanding and perceptions of the ACA. For example, the mean ACA knowl- edge score was 5.21/9, which is a far higher average score than published reports of reported knowledge on other science- or health-related issues (Hindman 2012; Kim et al. 2015). Future studies should further explore the public’s understanding of the ACA and also examine ACA enrollment rates in Richland County and in comparable counties in the state of South Carolina and nationally. Finally, the authors acknowledge that although survey results informed the library’s promotional campaign, due to the timely nature of the topic and the March 31 ACA marketplace deadline, there was not enough time to test our campaign concepts with county residents. It is important to point out, however, that for the next phase of this project, which includes developing tailored ACA educational messages, the authors plan to test messages and concepts through focus-group research. Conclusion As this partnership among a public library system, an academic institution, and a nonpartisan health policy institute moves forward with ACA-related education and outreach after the March 31, 2014, ACA marketplace deadline, there are key survey findings that are important to consider. Even though survey research indicated that local television news was a most-used, and most-effective, source for ACA information, there were other sources (e.g., doctors and employers) that residents reported would be effective for getting the word out about the ACA. Although the current campaign capitalized on local television news as a means to commu- nicate about the ACA, our team should focus efforts on expanding our reach to other sources that survey respondents reported to be effective communication channels for receiving ACA information. Further, survey results revealed that mean ACA knowledge scores were, not sur- prisingly, lower among residents who were uneducated, unemployed, lacked health insurance, and had a lower socioeconomic status. Future work should focus on tailoring key educational messages to these residents, who need the information and knowledge the most. As the research team also conducted a series of focus groups in the county, findings from the qualitative phase of our research will allow us to better tailor specific messages to individuals who typically face numerous health disparities (Adams et al. 2006; Adams et al. 2009; Hebert et al. 2009; Kim et al. 2015). Research findings and reported campaign strategies are helpful for health communication or public relations practitioners and scholars seeking to better understand how to promote awareness of and provide educational outreach about complex health- or medical-related is- sues. Study findings will inform the development of ACA messages, materials, and programs that can effectively inform residents in Richland County as well as other areas of the state. In fact, a similar approach could be utilized to effectively disseminate information about other important issues or needs in a community. Findings will be shared with other public libraries
