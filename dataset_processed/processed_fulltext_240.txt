the library quarterly volume  april  number  aftermath of a crusade world war i and the enlarged program of the american library association arthur p young shortly after the united states entered world war  the american library association ala embarked on an ambitious program the library war service to furnish library materials and services to an american army of several million men the considerable success of this wartime venture coupled with the nation postwar euphoria prompted the ala leadership to sponsor in the early months of  a project known as the enlarged program the enlarged program was a major initiative to revitalize library services and to establish ala as the dominant force in library affairs among the proposals were continuation of selected war related services closer liaison with other professional groups new programs of service for adults and immigrants promotion of library extension certification of professional education and constitutional revision to achieve these objectives a  million fund drive was authorized despite the best of intentions the enlarged program turned into ala most humiliating defeat until that time the objectives campaign strategy ideology and reception of the enlarged program are considered and assessed prelude when in the summer of  an assassin bullet ended the life of archduke francis ferdinand in sarajevo bosnia few americans believed that the incident would trigger the catastrophic conflict familiarly library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago    
 the library quarterly known as world war i or simply the great war for almost three years president wilson pursued a progressively difficult policy of neutrality toward the warring parties but the continuing threat of germany submarine warfare and the very real possibility that western europe might fall persuaded wilson and his advisers in april  that america must declare war and join the allies that decision had momentous implications for the nation including the american library association ala for most americans the war became a morally charged even spiritualized struggle against the tyranny of german autocracy librarians too readily embraced the patriotic emotionalism and were eager to contribute their services to the war effort a significant contribution by ala was not foreordained by its history between  and  the association had made modest gains in defining the field of librarianship and convincing the public of the library educational value to accept responsibility for a program of library service to an american army of several million men did not seem probable for an organization of  members which operated on an annual budget of  but when the opportunity arose the association boldly accepted the challenge and succeeded beyond expectation shortly after the american declaration of war ala established a war service committee to explore the type and extent of assistance which it might be able to provide this committee in june  accepted an invitation from the war department commission on training camp activities to furnish library materials and services to us soldiers throughout the world the association was one of the seven welfare groups affiliated with the commission ala wartime program designated the library war service was directed by herbert putnam librarian of congress and later by carl h milam the future secretary of the association between  and  ala mounted two financial campaigns and raised  million from public donations erected thirty six camp library buildings from carnegie corporation funds and distributed  million books and magazines to over  locations nearly  persons worked in military libraries administered by ala librarians by their zealous promotion of libraries as educational centers and agencies of social reformation were engaged in what may be considered a global book crusade for a brief time the crusade transformed ala from a relatively unknown professional society into a public service organization with national aspirations for leadership and service the episode of the library war service proved to many librarians and civilian leaders that the association could mobilize the resources of the nation libraries and perform a difficult task with distinction the results were gratifying the military departments assimilated
world war i and ala enlarged program  the library programs and continued them after the war the association headquarters library in france continued as the american library in paris and the war influenced subsequent directions of ala in the areas of adult education and international cooperation above all the association savored the public recognition that it had sought for so long that exhilarating experience in turn led prominent leaders of the association to sponsor a project known as the enlarged program the story begins several months after the armistice  passiml postwar aspirations apathy despair and a return to normalcy would follow soon enough after the armistice but the mood did not change precipitously during the immediate postwar months the nation experienced a period of buoyant expectation america future seemed to be on everyone agenda optimism abounded especially among religious social and professional organizations now was the propitious moment many reformers believed to capitalize on the moral enthusiasm and cooperative spirit unleashed by the war under the rubric of reconstruction many ideas and proposals were advanced relating to social justice economic security and political reformation  pp   talk was plentiful but it was not easy to discern a coherent direction some viewed reconstruction as a vehicle for spiritual regeneration others saw it as an opportunity to revamp the economic system and still others interpreted it to mean the redistribution of political power beneath the cascade of activist rhetoric however was a common set of postulates history was an exploitive process a continuing tyranny of the few over the many america was at the threshold of an egalitarian age and all citizens should enjoy the benefits of modern technology certain political social and economic imbalances needed correction and there was a consensus that the transition could be accomplished peaceably the unfinished agenda would be realized through increased voluntary cooperation and preferably through expanded regulatory actions of the government  pp   birth of the enlarged program the reconstruction program of the american library association designated the enlarged program began as a modest proposal for a library  for an extended treatment of ala during world war i consult young 
 the library quarterly survey in a few months this project was transformed into a major commitment to organizational change and expanded library services in many respects the enlarged program was a microcosm of postwar reconstructionism leaders of the enlarged program emphasized the role of books and libraries as instrumentalities for social betterment enhanced organizational prestige and greater regulatory authority within the profession were implicit if not explicit goals and the best way to achieve these ends was to harness the collective strength of the nation libraries and library supporters on january   the executive board authorized william warner bishop president of ala to appoint a committee of five to survey the entire field of american library services the survey bishop said would be analogous to the celebrated committee of ten report on secondary education in  and abraham flexner influential report on medical education in  a library survey would enable librarians to evaluate the success or failure of their services and internal operations bishop wanted specific facts not hortatory or theoretical information the resultant data would provide the library profession for the first time with the information needed to establish standards for buildings equipment services and salaries appointed to serve on the committee of five were arthur e bostwick st louis public library chairman linda a eastman cleveland public library azariah s root oberlin college library charles c williamson new york public library and carl h milam acting director of the library war service the committee was requested to prepare a report for the asbury park new jersey conference in june  milam was among those who envisioned a much broader program than a general survey of library conditions three weeks before the annual conference he wrote to walter l brown former ala president that the association should continue to support war related programs principally the services to the merchant marine hospitals and the blind as for the american library association milam favored a vigorous new role the ala should undertake the responsibility of making itself the big force behind all library development issuing propaganda arousing interest conducting campaigns in the field for establishment of library commissions public libraries libraries in industrial concerns libraries in state penal correctional and charitable institutions etc no matter what results may come from the discussion of these subjects at asbury park i feel that we have already accomplished somethings sic and assume as a matter of course that we can get the money somewhere if we decided that we really ought to do the work  as instructed by president bishop the committee presented its report to the members at asbury park in presenting the report the committee
world war i and ala enlarged program  indicated that the survey was justified on the grounds that present library work was carried on without accurate comparative data the task of gathering and sifting the data would be largely accomplished by a volunteer staff expenses for travel clerical assistance and publication of the final report were estimated at  four survey areas were defined and assigned to committee members root was given responsibility for the acquisition technical processing and storage of books circulation reference and library extension were the topics assigned to eastman library education staff training and salaries would be analyzed by williamson milam would investigate library government relations finances and publicity  pp   meanwhile the council was considering whether the association should raise a  million dollar endowment for peace work pride in the wartime library service and the reconstructionist mood in the country were conducive to favorable consideration james wyer chairman of the war service committee endorsed the idea noting that the patriotic motivation behind the library war service would sustain a postwar program and fund raising campaign theresa hitchler of the brooklyn public library worried about the consequences of not supporting an endowment if the ala is not going to sink back and become a reactionary institution it ought to go right on and continue where it left off with the library war service  p  charles e rush chairman of the publicity committee delivered a stirring speech on behalf of an expanded program we must create prestige and build good will for the entire organization arouse public confidence in the library as an educational enterprise interpret the service of libraries to the public and furnish humanized dramatized reviews of library activities a publicity service bureau designed to inaugurate a nationwide educational program is the    most advantageous method to accomplish such results  pp   not all of the comments on the proposed endowment were favorable frank p hill chairman of the library war finance committee and director of the brooklyn public library cautioned the members that a large sum of money at least  would be required to underwrite a drive for an endowment fund he also feared that the public was tired of money campaigns and that library trustees would not release their staffs to work on another campaign further study of an endowment was desirable hill conceded but a good plan would take at least one year  p  most trenchant of the critics predictably was john cotton dana of the newark public library the association asserted dana should consider not what libraries were but what they ought to be what needed to be studied then was not library activities but rather the place of the library phenomenon in a print using society  p  any
 the library quarterly survey should also examine the association staff and mission dana singled out ala seventeen year old constitution as a major deterrent to progress he proposed instead a single page document which would entrust leadership of the association to no more than five persons  p  deferring to the council sentiment for expanded postwar services the executive board on june   at the asbury park conference appointed a committee on enlarged program accompanying the appointment was a declaration by the executive board that it was the responsibility of the american library association to encourage and promote the development of library service for every man woman and child in america  p  members of the enlarged program committee were frank p hill chairman caroline f webster new york state library carl h milam john cotton dana and walter l brown on september   milam was appointed director of the enlarged program milam new position consolidated his administrative control over virtually all ala activities he was now acting general director of the library war service director of the enlarged program and a member of the executive board six months later he was to become executive secretary of ala upon george utley resignation the agenda taking the executive board charge seriously the committee on enlarged program met twelve times during the summer of  a tentative document was approved by the executive board at richfield springs new york in early september and was published in library journal the following month recommendations were divided into three categories continuation of war related activities new programs and constitutional revision a one year budget of  million was proposed of this figure  was needed to support programs growing out of the war library service would be continued for hospitals lighthouses the merchant marine industrial plants and blind soldiers it was anticipated that this portion of the program would not extend much beyond one year  pp   another substantial allocation nearly  was set aside for new programs in order to promote library extension in the states it was recommended that ala function as a national library commission states would be helped by the association to secure favorable library legislation and to initiate library service in unserved areas a national examining board empowered to grant certificates and to set standards for library schools was to be established the library survey was also to
world war i and ala enlarged program  be a part of the enlarged program heeding dana earlier admonition the survey would evaluate the role of libraries in the social and educational life of the nation  pp   a national program of education and information was highlighted the association would be responsible for a nationwide promulgation of the library idea designed to stimulate the extension and development of libraries and to increase the use of print  p  these goals would be accomplished through exhibits publicity and the promotion of higher librarians salaries provision was made for a study of ala publishing activities another objective unfunded was to establish closer relations with the national education association if teachers more fully appreciated the value of libraries perhaps they might lend their prestigious support to the enlarged program other features of the plan encompassed service to institutional libraries and immigrants finally a financial campaign to raise  million was recommended  pp   constitutional revision was considered to be within the mandate of the committee on enlarged program actually two committees were writing a new constitution frank hill group apparently unaware of the special committee on constitutional reform appointed at asbury park issued its version in october  the special committee consisting of william w bishop george b utley and chalmers hadley ala president released its version the following month differences between the two documents were relatively minor new powers were conferred on the executive board at the expense of the council the executive board was vested with the authority to appoint all committees questions of policy must be submitted to the executive board before any action by the membership divested of its former powers the council was reduced to discussing professional issues and adopting resolutions entanglement of constitutional reform with the enlarged program was unfortunate those members opposed to organizational change tended to transfer their distrust to the enlarged program itself  deliberation and doubt almost as soon as details concerning the proposed enlarged program were disclosed rumors began to circulate about the removal of the ala headquarters from chicago to new york resentment was particularly strong in the midwest in november  the libraryjournal attempted to defuse the issue saying that there is no foundation for this impression  there had been several informal exchanges among members but no formal discussion or proposals had been introduced at the
 the library quarterly richfield springs meeting however a month later president hadley admitted that a proposal to transfer the headquarters to new york had been introduced at richfield springs at his insistence hadley said the recommendation was deleted from the committee report any suspicion that such action would be taken without the members consent hadley declared was entirely unwarranted  announcement that a temporary financial headquarters would be set up in new york city however only seemed to confirm apprehensions  no concerted attempt to move the headquarters was ever uncovered but the rumors served to heighten suspicions the first special session to discuss the enlarged program was held in chicago january    three hundred and twenty eight delegates braved chicago bone numbing weather to attend  p  constitutional revision dominated the first day debate president hadley presided while bishop explained the new constitution and solicited questions constituting themselves as a committee of the whole the members challenged bishop on every point down to the punctuation disapproval was pervasive concerning the procedures for electing honorary members the new policy prerogatives of the executive board the role of affiliated organizations and the divestiture of the council traditional powers   with such a reception there was no choice but to recommit the constitution for further revision bishop had withstood the assault with commendable forbearance nonetheless he left chicago disconsolate over the rejection of his work  pp   criticism of the enlarged program was more restrained yet there was disaffection over some actions of the program leaders and plans for the financial campaign phineas l windsor university of illinois library was irritated by the hiring of a publicity consultant j ray johnson before the chicago meeting and by milam forwarding of a letter to journalism schools asking for their assistance milam manfully took the responsibility making his apologies for any premature commitment  p  hill and richard r bowker the library publisher deflected the charge of a premature use of funds by informing members that a  loan to the enlarged program from the  library war service account had been approved by the executive board later the enlarged program received another loan of  from library war service funds  pp   there were differing viewpoints over how funds for the enlarged program should be raised realizing that some members were against a fund drive of the type conducted during the war hill cautiously referred to raising money instead of an intensive drive  p  the  million to be used over a three year period would be obtained from foundations and general subscriptions to many members hill state
world war i and ala enlarged program  ment that no intensive campaign would be conducted was unsatisfactory finally a resolution was passed which gave approval for an appeal for funds but it specifically prohibited any quota system   pp   the committee inability to fend off this restriction and the members lukewarm commitment to the financial campaign were harbingers of difficulties ahead charles h compton seattle public library correctly perceived the limiting effect of these strictures they were like giving a general orders to win a battle but instructing him that his army should go slow  p  until the chicago meeting there was no way of measuring the degree of concern over the alleged proposals to move the ala headquarters to new york to air the subject arthur e bostwick moved that the enlarged program be operated from the chicago offices president hadley who had earlier denied that a new york move was contemplated ruled that the resolution was a matter of policy and must come before the council bostwick appealed the chair ruling and was sustained by the members although he was not opposed to a complete move bostwick explained the idea of two headquarters was a needless duplication the motion carried this motion had no practical effect the enlarged program conducted its ill fated campaign from the new york office which it shared with the library war service   pp   unlike the proposed constitutional revision the enlarged program survived the scrutiny at chicago during the next few months the campaign organization was assembled regional directors were appointed and numerous publicity items were released just as the financial campaign was gaining some momentum opponents of the enlarged program publicly called for substantial modifications perhaps aware that even more criticism was imminent the committee on enlarged program issued an explanation on march   in a  page pamphlet the enlarged program was defended as a project authorized by the association and essentially quite modest in conception not more than a dozen letters of protest had been received by the executive board or the committee other organizations such as the salvation army and the national tuberculosis association had already run successful appeals it was time declared the committee to close ranks and stand by the committee and the association itself and its good repute  two weeks later a circular letter signed by thirteen prominent librarians was sent to every member of the association a considerable proportion of the membership it was asserted opposed the enlarged program as currently defined while a still greater percentage of members favored the imposition of more definite limits signers of this letter representing every section of the country included mary f isom portland oregon public library john h leete carnegie library of

 the library quarterly during the war the american library association remained aloof from the special libraries association sla when sla learned that special libraries were mentioned in the various enlarged program documents it lodged repeated protests with ala regarding its exclusion from a voice in policy formulation finally in february  the association sanctioned the formation of a joint ala sla committee on the enlarged program after this recognition the sla covered enlarged program activities in its journal special libraries and urged members to support the program and the financial campaign   experienced fund raisers and publicity experts were engaged to run the campaign from new york overseeing the campaign organization was elmore leffingwell longtime head of publicity for the salvation army speaking at the first conference of regional directors on february   frank hill was cautiously optimistic it is really a momentous occasion it is a serious time for you for me and for the association we are starting out on something new and yet a continuation of the work which we have been doing for the past three years it is a perilous venture that we are undertaking but one which i am sure is bound to end in success even if we do not get a dollar we are going to put the libraries on the map   by march  there were between twenty and thirty persons on the enlarged program payroll   p  as in the wartime campaigns a newsletter the ala blue letter was published to keep members and local libraries abreast of progress fourteen issues of the newsletter appeared between january  and june    the term enlarged program seemed a bit austere and in february the slogan books for everybody was introduced none of the newsletters carried information about the debilitating quarrel within the association at least half a dozen publicity pamphlets were printed some of which were slanted toward particular audiences some of the more ambitious pamphlets were entitled how books for everybody of the ala will help solve local library problems universal education through books for everybody and talking points about books for everybody the most attractive pamphlet books for everybody was designed for mass appeal on the cover of this  page color leaflet was a picture of three immigrants looking up at a tower of books the caption read good books make good citizens  the newsletter and the pamphlets were supplemented by a publicity blitz in the general press near the end of april it was reported that more than  newspapers and almost  magazines had run stories often illustrated ones about the enlarged program coverage in the general circulation magazines was extensive including good housekeeping outlook and the saturday evening post farm and trade journals were also receptive to the publicity releases accounts of the enlarged pro
