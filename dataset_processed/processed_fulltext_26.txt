do you really want a diverse program  my notes for the panel and this essay as well basically wrote themselves it was hard to stay on topic actually there was so much i wanted to say and yet i struggled a lot it was the same experience i had when we were working on our paper a critical dialogue faculty of color in library and information science ceja alcala colon aguirre cooke  stewart  the questions and doubts are always there how much should i really say how much of myself should i give to the world writing about this topic requires a certain degree of exposure you have to give your audience a glimpse into who you are not just you as a professional but you as a person as well writing this type of work requires us to make ourselves vulnerable in a field that does not appreciate this but instead expects us to be strong resilient and focused what follows are some of my innermost thoughts ideas and experiences i share them here in the hopes that the stories will resonate with others that they know they are not alone but also in the hopes that those in positions of power can understand and take action in order to fix a system that is not only broken but also in denial of its own shortcomings i will follow the guide questions i received as part of the panel in order to help keep my thoughts in order and focused tell us about a time when you experienced discrimination as an lis faculty member i really struggled with this premise even now when i think of it i struggle to produce an answer not because i dont have any but because i cannot find a way to verbalize the ones that i have experienced i have felt weird in some situations and i have been in situations that cannot be explained in any other way than acknowledging that i have experienced discrimination this might be because although my experiences with overt discrimination and racism might be few my experiences with m icroaggressions are too many to number the one that is most common is when i have been to various activities representing the institutions where i work and after being in conversation about scholarship in the field of lis and the nature of work in lis organizations and teaching in higher education the person talking to me will just say and what is it that you do at name of academic institution to which i always try a chipper answer of i teach i am a f aculty member more often than not the follow up will be something along the lines of an uncomfortable oh really on the part of my conversation partner these exchanges have always left me feeling slightly troubled what is it about me that does not match with being a faculty member i would love to think it is my youth but i know that as a  year old who looks like a  year old that explanation does not really make much sense there are many situations like these the maybe maybe not is always there the seed of doubt regarding the answer to the question why did that happen to me in most cases when i try discussing my discomfort or my outright anger for being in some sticky situations others just look for
 colon aguirre ways of rationalizing what just happened and painting it in a benign way so i am paranoid or so it appears it is not until i talk to other faculty of color that i start seeing the parallels between their experiences and mine it is not until i talk to these beloved colleagues that i start seeing the reason behind my discomfort and feel validated for not being able to ignore it or just get over it for the panel i decided to share some experiences that were more tangible for a general audience so instead of attempting to talk about an anecdote of outright discrimination at work which would have required a lot of context i chose to share three actual exchanges i had with students students only my idea was to portray the way in which i am treated by those i teach and in whose presence i spent most of my time i summarized the exchanges in three questions or comments i have been presented with some not in isolation meaning i have been expected to produce an answer to this question or comment more than once by various individuals  comment by student you said academia in class the other day and i looked it up in the dictionary and it is a real word you did not invent it i know college is a time to learn new things and explore but how many of you are questioned by your students as to the authenticity of the words you use for me it is almost part of my day to day i am not alone in this realm as research shows that non native englishspeaking faculty members at all levels experience various degrees of discrimination from their students particularly focused on students questioning the instructors competence based on their linguistic and cultural differences ates  eslami  lazaraton   why do you want to work in the us if you dont even speak english just to be clear i have never taught in a language other than english i only communicate in spanish with others who speak spanish and never when in the presence of people who do not speak the language my students do know where i am from and that i moved to the continental united states as an adult in order to join a graduate program and the reality is that i did not grow up in a bilingual household just like the majority of puerto ricans on the island i only spoke spanish at home english being a school subject to which i dedicated  minutes a day and some homework time but the insinuation that i do not speak english due to this is not a fair assessment of my language skills this remains to this day one of my most baffling encounters with a student and i still have no idea what an appropriate answer would have been  what is the history of uspuerto rico relations and how has it affected hurricane response this question came after the hurricane maria humanitarian crisis on the island where all of my family still resides the question
do you really want a diverse program  comes from a place of genuine concern and curiosity but it is still unfair to expect me to produce an articulate concise and clear answer the topic could not be explored in a conversation not even on a dissertation due to its complexity also intertwined with the aftermath of hurricane maria was my own emotional state what was for many a news headline was for me a personal crisis as all of my family were completely cut off for weeks my concern during that time and even months after was not with the state of libraries in puerto rico or the history of uspr relations it was trying to locate my family members and finding a way of sending them necessary provisions all of these experiences left me in a state of unease some left me completely baffled and some left me feeling defeated they are part of my dayto day interactions and in some cases not just at work but also in my social life when i first encountered some of them i was more likely to take my time and try to explain what i do how i feel or where i come from but as time goes by i grow more and more tired of having to carry the burden of explaining myself at every turn and yet when anyone including me sometimes looks at these they are not overtly discriminatory comments but i am tired of having to face them over and over and over again what i want the rest of the world to know about the experiences andor needs of faculty of color when this question was posed to me i started jotting down notes in order to prepare for the panel presentation i started writing a few times and each and every time i would stop myself and think but my colleagues are going to be there or i should not say that because my words can be misrepresented or misinterpreted and ill get in trouble whereas the panel presentation was prefaced by an agreement with the audience that the experiences we were about to share and the opinions we were about to voice were highly personal delicate and potentially dangerous and that discretion was advised this article does not present me or my colleagues with this consideration and yet i do not see any other way in which i can make my voice heard so i will preface the following comments in the same way in which i prefaced my answers to the questions posed that day i am coming from a place of love but im being as blunt as i can be because i realize now that being quiet or diplomatic has only led to c onformity and inaction my main concern with the state of diversity in lis as of late has been this why do we want diversity in lis this might seem like an unusual question but i still think that lis program managers faculty students and employers alike need to have some self reflection around this question about two years ago marybeth gasman  a professor of education at the university of pennsylvania wrote an article later reprinted in the washington post titled the five things no one will tell you about why
 colon aguirre colleges dont hire more faculty of color the main point made in the article was as follows the reason we dont have more faculty of color among college faculty is that we dont want them we simply dont want them these remarks sparked all kinds of reactions from those inside and outside of academia but they highlighted an issue that has been on the minds of many of us why are there still so few people of color in academia the problem seems to go beyond the usual suspect of a limited pipeline of qualified people of color poc going into academia to one that is more worrisome the reluctance of many academic institutions to hire faculty of color especially the highly coveted full time tenure track positions faculty of color may present problems for academic programs due to some hiring and retention practices that function to exclude faculty of color in academic programs for example many faculty of color pursue lines of research that deal with more complex and time consuming methodologies and research topics such as action based and qualitative research methodologies with minority or protected groups these issues can lead to smaller research outputs than other areas of research stanley  an issue like this not only affects the new incoming candidate who will most likely have fewer publications but is also connected to the issue of retention which demands an ever growing body of work issues of publication output can be combined with the attitudes of hiring committees in academia which value quality something that as pointed out by gasman  is usually measured by a candidates attendance at an elite institution and mentorship by a prominent person in the field what committees do not take into consideration asserts gasman is that these are social capital systems that systemic racism practices have made sure stay out of reach for people of color these are only some of the issues that faculty of color face in academia which render them less desirable as candidates for academic institutions when other factors are added including language barriers cultural expectations and overt racist and sexist practices the prospects for faculty of color in academia are as grim as they can get these points are well explored in the literature in fact i see a lot of initiatives to hire train and retain poc in academia including lis and yet i do not see a lot of minorities working in academia it might be a matter of time these initiatives are fairly new and it will take time for their effects to kick off but the feeling i cannot shake off is that we are getting lost in a catch  of wanting minorities to join academia but not wanting academia to support minorities after all even some job advertisements have explicit statements informing applicants that minority candidates will be given priority but hiring is only step  in a long road to tenure and a career so my main point for lis before paying lip service to the mandate of hiring more faculty of color and espousing more diverse workplaces just because it is the right thing to do or what everybody is doing is this
do you really want a diverse program  why do you want to do this do you want to do it because you value our contributions and you see the need for different voices and perspectives of marginalized groups or do you do it because everyone else is doing it and the faculty profiles website looks colorful if the answer is the first one or one that is close enough then in my opinion your heart is in the right place now comes the difficult part hiring and retaining faculty of color you will need to consider the following  we might need protection from organizational practices from some colleagues and in some cases even from studentsit is a reality that poc especially women are more undermined and ignored in academia if you seek evidence look no further than the book presumed incompetent the intersections of race and class for women in academia gutierrez y muhs niemann gonzalez  harris  spoiler alert women in academia are presumed by colleagues administrators and students to be token hires their abilities and talents are constantly questioned overlooked and minimized with their intersectionality as women and poc being used as the only rationalization or the outstanding reason that they were even hired for their job  we might need time to develop complex research agendas that are not easily publishable so we might need to be defended against the tenure clockthe required research pipeline or as a friend of mine called it once the research irrigation system is not sustainable the ever growing demands of academic jobs are not really sustainable for anyone not just faculty of color but the time to publication in some cases is much longer and the productive output of the academic year is lower since scholars who are pocs tend to do research work with populations that require embedding themselves into their groups and gaining their trust which takes a significant portion of time their research also tends to rely on the employment of more engaged research methodologies such as ethnography which require much more time to develop in addition these forms of research carry the additional load of self reflection and validation of methods in order to avoid violating ethical norms even questioning our own morality in doing so this translates to smaller research output and heavier representation of qualitative methodologies interestingly enough this field requires this type of work in order to understand and improve services to those who belong to underserved populations  we need to be treated as individuals and not as representatives of an entire race gender or nationtokenism is not good and the emotional labor that accompanies being a minority is not good either i can only explain to people that i am an american citizen by birth that i learned english as a second language in my rural public school and that i have nothing in common with any of the characters in west side story so many times before i just start telling
