 cooke sanchez article it was decided to use it as inspiration for a panel at the  alise conference in denver colorado two of the article authors were able to participate on the panel planned and implemented by the alise multicultural ethnic and humanistic concerns special interest group mehc the panel featured nine faculty members of color most of whom contributed to this special issue as authors and editors panelists were asked two simple but profound questions  tell us about a time when you experienced discrimination as an lis faculty member and  what do you want the rest of the world to know about the experiences andor needs of faculty of color their authentic stories were told in front of a standing room only audience some of whom could personally empathize with the stories shared others who were shocked at the scenarios described and perhaps there were even some in the room who recognized themselves in the panelists stories and registered anger and disbelief instead of feeling an impetus to disrupt the status quo to say that the panel was emotional and draining would be an understatement the panelists reflected on the session for weeks afterward all the while hearing from colleagues who were in the room and from some who were not present and wanted to commend them on their bravery and honesty more than a year later panelists still receive comments about the power of this panel because of the lasting impact of this panel it was decided to revisit these stories in print form as is often the case with articles about race microaggressions discrimination and other difficult topics finding a home for this special issue was not automatic nor easy but persistence is the name of the game particularly when dealing with stories that must be told with that in mind the special issue editors are grateful to the jelis editors for providing the space and encouragement to shine a light on these important stories that need to be told the stories that appear in this issue are ethnographic counter stories which are the authors way of going on the record and demonstrating their resistance and resilience telling counter stories is a method of telling the stories of those people whose experiences are not often told ie those on the margins of society the counter story is also a tool for exposing analyzing and challenging the majoritarian stories of racial privilege counter stories can shatter complacency challenge the dominant discourse on race and further the struggle for racial reform yet counter s tories need not be created only as a direct response to majoritarian stories    indeed within the histories and lives of people of color there are numerous unheard counter stories storytelling and counter storytelling these experiences can help strengthen traditions of social political and cultural survival and resistance solorzano  yosso  p 
getting it on the record faculty of color in library and information science  none of these counter stories was easy to share at the conference and they were even harder to write but all of the authors feel it is important to share and officially document their struggles in an effort to bring awareness and generate honestand it is hopedt ransformative conversations about how the field needs to grow and change to be more respectful welcoming and inclusive of minority faculty staff and students the field and professoriate have a retention problem one that is easily ignored and elicits exasperated and sometimes insincere questions of what can we do the infographic the problem woman of colour in the workplace can easily be retitled the problem faculty of color in the professoriate minority faculty members can be hired as tokens and are certainly treated as such particularly when they are the only one or one of few people of color in a school department or unit they routinely experience microaggressions and repetitive injuries in some case they have been physically touched or aggressed upon they face denials of abuse and mistreatment and are labeled as angry and or overly sensitive or are accused of playing the race card they are sometimes implicitly and explicitly retaliated against and they all face thoughts and realities of exiting their organization for the sake of their health and safety not to mention their job satisfaction and chances of promotion hence the profession has serious retention concerns all of these factors deserve serious consideration strategizing and correction and these conversations need to happen before the field reaches a point where faculty of color cannot be retained and new tokenized replacements cannot be secured it is hoped that these essays are read with open minds open hearts and a desire to improve the field and professoriate for everyones sake themes the seven articles presented in this special issue address the experience of being a person of color and a faculty member in an lis program when these pieces are read back to back perhaps the most striking realization is that while each article makes informative and poignant illustrations of individual instances of derogatory speech and action as an aggregate they paint a hard to miss canvas of classifiable deeply entrenched trends of othering of faculty of color across different lis programs taken separately difficult to pinpoint hostilities and off the wall comments may be interpreted as social flukes but when one sees the same odd and inappropriate exchanges happen again and again to different professors of color across the lis it becomes apparent that there are indeed patterns of experiences that apply only to minority faculty in fact the editors of this special issue found quite a few commonalities with personal incidents mentioned by the authors from getting ones hair fondled by curious colleagues to having ones professorial rank rudely questioned by students
 cooke sanchez not surprisingly none of the authors chose to highlight the joys of being faculty of color focusing on the many challenges presented by this ascribed status dr renate l chancellor of the catholic university of america discusses the ever prevalent racial battle fatigue as well as the double burden of racism and sexism faced by female faculty of color in the lis professional environment dr monica colon aguirre of simmons college advises lis programs to reach past the diversity rhetoric and ask themselvesourselves what we mean by wanting a diverse programand are we willing to go past lip service and do what it takes to cultivate and support minority faculty getting past the hypocrisy of diversity lip service is a goal expressed by another author dr bharat mehra of the university of tennessee who shares his experiences of being a gay male lis faculty member of color and an international hire the overt and subtle microaggressions he has experienced since becoming a professor in the united states have inclined him to wish that colleagues spoke up more on behalf of each other when they witnessed bullying and injustice or heard their colleagues express discomfort or offense toward biased language and behavior dr renee f hill of the university of maryland talks about the epidemic exploitative othering of female faculty of color by ignorant a dministrators sheltered colleagues and vain mentors as well as the uneasy reluctance to share these stories for the weary concern of b eing called a liar the go to tendency of privileged colleagues to dismiss complaints by faculty of color as overreacting and being confrontational and uncooperative is addressed by dr amelia n gibson of the university of northern carolina at chapel hill dr gibson points out the toxic history and cycle that has governed lis policy of ignoring and glazing over any uneasiness within its ranks by weaponizing the argument for civility in order to silence unhappy or dissenting voices of faculty of color dr nicole a cooke of the university of illinois urbanachampaign writes about the pervasive microaggressions or impolite hostilities that plague minority faculty members take place quite regularly and despite being hurtful to the objects of these comments and actions are considered normal and acceptable in lis programs manipulation tactics such as gaslighting minimizing and the silent treatment are routinely infused into administrative practices and the departmental culture at lis programs that keep faculty of color isolated anxious and second guessing their own perceptions dr cooke stresses the importance of counter storytelling as a means to bring exposure to these topics and to foster solidarity among the recipients of these injustices dr vanessa irvin of university of hawai at manoa talks about the dehumanizing effect of racism and of a library culture that must acknowledge its past and current transgressions with a long history of perceiving and treating ethnic minorities and differently abled patrons as in need of extra help special instruction and charitable tolerance
getting it on the record faculty of color in library and information science  microaggressions in addition to referencing documented evidence of bigotry in the academic setting each author provides examples from their personal life that illustrate times when they had been affected by speech or behaviors from colleagues administration or students that were demeaning or offensive but at the same time too nebulous in their racism or sexism to be reportable one of the key running themes across the featured articles is that while overt displays of bigotry can still be encountered in most cases modern manifestations of racial prejudice and chauvinism exist in such subtle nuanced formats that even their recipients are sometimes left scratching their heads when trying to articulate what precisely constitutes the hate crime even with the knowledge that something is definitely wrong microaggressions earned their name for being tiny servings of prejudice injected into popular common sayings ritualistic social niceties and even compliments much like backhanded compliments microaggressions are insults wrapped in superficial pleasantries or small talk they are comments of dubious positive value that leave a bad taste behind even as one finds oneself responding with a thank you on autopilot the most devious aspect of microaggressions is that they are frequently intended as earnest positive sentiments with speakers being unaware of the condescending tone or the insultingly low expectations lurking behind their own words the crushing disempowerment brought on by microaggressions comes not as much from their slippery meanings as from their sheer volume and omnipresence in our culture they are like micro dosages of poison that if taken daily will slowly and stealthily result in a certain death microaggressions are most potent ie most harmful when experienced regularly repeatedly and from multiple sourcesand are notoriously difficult to prove as problematic to individuals not used to being on the receiving end of subtly and playfully racist and sexist commentary demonstrating racism to be the culprit behind any one strangely uncomfortable or vaguely inappropriate interaction to a non minority colleague is challenging to say the least as they have no personal understanding of how real life discrimination works or feels attempts at explaining why something is racist or sexist draw more racist and sexist responses from privileged colleagues who have no idea that social inequality is not a singular experience of something as evident as name calling or not being let into a nightclub it is rather the cumulative effect of countless everyday repetitive harmful interactions with coworkers and strangers who feel and act superior and get away with it such events might be mildly unsettling upsetting or discouraging if they happened once but over time the barrage of indignities chips away at the persons self worth and grows unbearable and destructive as part of an everyday vicious cycle of mistreatment under appreciation and denial of rights access and upward mobility on the basis of superficial arbitrary social markers such as race ethnicity gender or sexual orientation
 cooke sanchez othering at the center of all the articles there is a shared group identity of being othered othering serves to mark and name those thought to be different from oneself weis  p  and takes many forms quite a few of which are listed by our authors from being fetishized as an exotic creature complete with breaches of physical boundaries and fixated fascination with skin color and hair texture to being expected to represent all people of color and as such to serve as moderator and expert on all discussions of race and to have knowledge and opinions on everything pertaining to african americans and black history some of these othering tactics are often justified as being empowering to minority faculty after all they get special attention and extra authority in reality the unasked for spotlight only serves to add pressure and embarrassment for faculty of color within the lis environment the forced emphasis on a faculty members race as a trait that makes them different from the lis collective is a perversely counter productive way to welcome a scholar an educator and a researcher into the midst of intellectual peers the glaring markedness of being considered diverse above all other personal or professional qualifications reduces the individual to a singular social demographic characteristic that signals a deviation from the norm and serves to keep the individual from getting too comfortable by virtue of feeling singled out and observed with curiosity and expectation no matter how much they masquerade under the guise of sowing specialness othering practices are acts of exclusion that serve to reinforce and reproduce positions of dominance and subordination fine  alas most of us are tragically unwilling to entertain the possibility of being biased or succumbing to stereotypical thinking taking an extremely defensive stance at any mention of racism the american dream is too deeply rooted in the ideal of meritocracy to acknowledge that one is possibly being unfair to a fellow individual due to a social prejudice is to acknowledge being a shameful person and a bad american white americans are genuinely mortified at being called racist but for many its not because they are sincerely ashamed for callously offending a fellow human these individuals take offense to being called racist because it unsettlingly casts the shadow of doubt on their tolerant savior self image to be fair it is a classical human tendency to mistake our highly subjective culturally socialized biases for natural facts dominant cultural narratives exert substantial influences on the perceptions expectations and behaviors of members of majority groups with respect to minorities in predictable almost scripted and unconscious ways ewick  silbey as cited in hasford  tokenism insult is added to injury for lis faculty of color when they find themselves tasked with representing for and explaining the behavior of all people of color to white faculty some of whose interest in race and ethnicity is driven more by morbid curiosity than empathy or desire to understand
getting it on the record faculty of color in library and information science  since faculty of color are frequently the first and only of their ethnic kind in the lis program they are expected to take over the role of mentor for every student or faculty member of color that comes through the department which creates additional workload one that goes without extra pay and does not count toward tenure given that women and racial minorities are already at a disadvantage with lower salaries compared to their white male counterparts having those two groups shoulder the most extra unpaid uncredited labor at the workplace is economically exploitative and socially unethical additionally faculty of color are by default understood to serve as the diverse face of the program being pushed to the front of every group photo and expected to be present at every politically visible meeting the involuntary role of having to represent the institution eclipses the freedom of being perceived as a professional in ones own right not to mention putting unrealistic pressure on the individual to be a model representative of their minority group second guessed at every turn another hard to ignore thread uniting the authors experiences as minority members of their respective lis programs is the incessant inescapable challenging of authority and expertise thanks to racial and gendered stereotyping authors recount experiences in which students refused to believe they were faculty members and where colleagues needed confirmation from white or male peers before validating a statement made by a female professor of color there are stories of being treated intellectually lacking due to english being a faculty members second language as well as accounts of being statistically nonexistent due to low representation of the faculty members minority type in lis combined with classification inaccuracies in demographic surveying of the field it comes down to this white administrators faculty and students are not used to seeing many people of color in positions of power and authority so they experience cognitive dissonance when encountering a professor who in their preconceived bias does not look like a professor part of being privileged is feeling free to exercise the right to challenge and question authority which is why many white colleagues think nothing of vocalizing their puzzlement or demanding additional proof when they perceive somethingor someoneas not making sense perhaps in a post racial utopia this would not be a problem but the current lis climate is still wrought with double standards faculty of color neither have the same habit of publicly second guessing their white colleagues qualifications and credentialsnor would they be able to get away with such arrogant attitudes and unprofessional conduct in the workplace on the contrary minority faculty learn to meticulously filter their speech and exercise the utmost sensitivity and gentleness when expressing a criticism or grievance toward colleagues or students lest they get branded troublesome
 cooke sanchez and quarrelsome which leads to being ignored avoided and ultimately isolated from the lis community racial battle fatigue there are myriad ways in which being a member of racial minority takes a toll on an lis faculty members wellness all the aforementioned concessions of dignity and picking up others slack in academic as well as emotional labor result in a measurable and latent toll on physical and mental health something that is mentioned by all authors for instance being the token diversity hire at a given lis program is exhausting there are unspoken expectations for shouldering extra work and service at the department there is also the insipid emotional burden of representing ones own race when the individual personality and behavior of one person of color are perceived as the blueprint of what to expect from the entire racialethnic population that this person represents in the eyes of their non minority colleagues in tow comes the unsolicited responsibility to have special insight into why other members of the same raceacademics politicians entertainers perfect strangersare the way they are and do what they do there is also the dubious honor of serving as the de facto moral conscience at departmental meetings and other public forums where white faculty seem quite at a loss about what constitutes appropriate versus inappropriate behavior and nice versus offensive remarks in a diverse professional climateand look to their diverse colleagues for guidance and approval perhaps one would be more willing to forgive this scenario if it were not a trap when faculty of color do speak up about discriminatory practices or offensive comments they are met with defensiveness dismissal and apologism any emphasis on racial difference even as a model minority creates strains for faculty of color as exemplified by the john henryism coping strategy when marginalized individuals fully aware of the unfair disadvantages they are up against make a commitment to do whatever it takes to succeed against all odds resulting in premature exhaustion of their intellectual physical and mental resources which causes irreversible physical and emotional damage down the road at least one author in this special issue directly mentions experiencing ptsd as the result of unhealthy work environment in lis while most authors allude to having been traumatized in some form or another compounded inequalities having one minority characteristic brings on a certain amount of inequality which grows exponentially worse as more minority traits are layered being a faculty of color comes with racist remarks and practices but being a female faculty of color intensifies the mistrust experienced as a racial minority and adds a layer of being considered biologically weak
getting it on the record faculty of color in library and information science  consequently being a gay female faculty of color introduces yet another dimension of misinterpretation and discrimination based on a culture of homophobiaand so on lack of tangible support institutional and individual the overwhelming scarcity of faculty of color across lis programs is a glaring statistic noted by several authors and as one author points out the problem is not the classical limited pipeline of qualified people of color explanation trope rather the truth is that beyond the diversity virtue signaling lis programs make no tangible effort to be welcoming or safe for faculty of color past checking the diversity hire box they show no comprehension of the complexity or the intersectionality of the minority experience and offer no protection for the said diversity hires why because they never asked themselves dr colon aguirres questionwhy do we want a diversity programat least not with the goal of building a meritocratic humane compassionate professional environment the concept of diversity in human resources is rooted in avoiding legal liability and fulfilling bureaucratic quotas rather than fostering an equal respectful workplace neither the lis administration nor the faculty body has the appropriate socio historical grasp of why diversity hires exist in the first place and why having social diversity is not just a politically correct mandate that must be obeyed but is actually a healthier and better intellectual environment for an academic setting than social homogeneity it evidently needs to be clarified that hiring diverse candidates is not an act of charity but a mutually beneficial arrangement between the program and the professional unfortunately as of yet many well meaning allies who truly believe in having a diverse and fair workplace still do not realize that faculty of color have a different experience than themselves and fail to show positively impactful support as opposed to pitying condescending pseudo support that can only add to the burden when faculty of color voice their grievances individual risk reading these pieces one can clearly see that even the act of publishing these very articles that were specifically requested for this special issue on critical dialog on faculty of color in lis programs was wrought with potential risks to the authors careers reputations and mental health each author has previously experienced negative unconvinced or downright hostile receptions from colleagues and other professional acquaintances when suggesting that racism or another form of bigotry was a factor in departmental decisions or workplace interactions and lets own up to it there are absolutely no guarantees that they will not face similarly harsh scrutiny and dismissiveness in response to the publication of these insights this collection of article essays is not typical academic scholarship they are acts of breaking oppressive silence of taking a
 cooke sanchez stand on a politically volatile and dangerous issue and though words are picked carefully and nothing radical is suggested unless unity mutual respect and cooperation among colleagues are radical ideas today it is still risky for junior and senior faculty alike to speak about manifestations of oppression and exploitation in lis programs even when they are answering a call for papers in a socially sanctioned forum they do not feel comfortable or safe to speak the truth as their careers and reputations are presently at stake if being noticed for speaking up against racially motivated injustice threatens ones career and social standing there is also the opposite extreme of not being taken seriously at all rendered invisible ineffectual and with a compromised trust in ones own judgment several authors mention their personal struggles with deciding whether to speak out in the lis workplace and then having to carefully craft the most gentle delicate ways to frame the conversation so as not essentially to spook the majority of faculty administration or students by calling out offensive comments or discriminatory treatment too bluntly each author has personally experienced instances of not being taken at their word of having their narrative questioned scrutinized and presumed exaggerated each author has found themselves doubting their own understanding of and reaction to incidents that felt injurious to their dignity when one is in a small minority surrounded by a majority that cannot relate to ones experience one has to work extra hard to have ones version of reality accepted as real and valid as the majority backed by institutional preference against rocking the boat of the status quo in place chooses not to engage in an open honest and amicable dialog about race and gender relations victims of injustice are not only silenced but also forced into a position of isolation in which it becomes easy to question ones judgment and wonder if it is indeed paranoia and not institutionalized and normalized social injustice causing one to feel discouraged and disenchanted from the lack of professional support and shortage of collegial empathy and solidarity in the lis culture and professional space conclusions now what this special issue shines light on everyday discriminatory practices that continue to manifest themselves in library and information sciences throughout the united states there are numerous causes and explanations for why social injustice continues to durably reproduce through our culture and institutions too complex to tackle in one place yet based on the contributions offered in this special issue we can surmise that the answer lies at least in part in avoiding the human and focusing on resources when it comes to setting priorities in hiring practices this perspective is dominant not only in the logic of hr departments but in the academic culture as well perhaps the reason lis programs continue
getting it on the record faculty of color in library and information science  to fail at recruiting or retaining faculty of color is that the origins of affirmative actiondiversity hiring are motivated less by trying to fix the problem of harmful bigotry that affects minority members of lis and more by anticipating and cushioning the problems what will arise when inevitably someone complains about unequal or insulting treatment as such diversity hiring practices are treated and enacted as a legal obligation and a necessary evil for maintaining a positive public image what is missing in most diversity policies in lis programs and in academia in general is making the diverse faculty members the priority of the initiative not the prop in it the goal should not be to attract faculty of color to the program lock them down with a contract and abandon them to their own devices from then on as several authors point out each lis department has an obligation to protect its faculty of color from the same systemic problems that necessitated diversity hiring practices in the first place and sometimes that means proactively defending individuals against callous comments from colleagues and students and investigating administrative malpractices it does not help that the term diversity hire is in itself a microaggression that subliminally summons suspicion and invites judgment about a person who came into the workplace under this label by putting diversity front and center it pushes out any mention of professional merit and not so subtly implies that this category of hire was brought in to fill a quota so their presence is a consequence of charity on the institutions behalf rather than a mutually beneficial progression of the best qualified best fitting candidate being rightfully selected for the job several authors in this issue bring up this well documented phenomenon backed by personal experiences being a professor of color attracts a casual suspicion that skin color or other demographic minority qualification was the governing reason behind their obtaining their faculty post as opposed to the more logical assumption exercised toward white colleagues that since the hire was rigorously selected from the competition they must have been the best candidate for the job therefore the sabotaging terms diversity hire and affirmative action hire must be dropped from use and substituted with neutral descriptive terms that communicate the value of inclusion such as best candidate diversity should not be used to game two hires from a single job posting as if there were only one qualified candidate and the other candidate were part of some sort of a compromisefavor to diversity quota all diversity hire means is that one of the best qualified candidates who would have been hired regardless of minority status will also make the given lis program more diverse in terms of race gender sexual orientation and other human perspectives that will contribute to the intellectual and cultural well roundedness of the workplace before sophisticated dialog about racism sexism homophobia and other bigotry in lis can thrive the principal challenge for lis
