volume  january  number i tunnel vision and blind spots what the past tells us about the present reflections on the twentieth century history of american librarianshipi wayne a wiegand the twentieth century american library is one of this nation most understudied yet ubiquitous institutions possessing a rich history of service to millions of users who over the generations have variably appropriated library collections and serices for multiple purposes for the most part however the library and information science lis research community has failed to analyze the deeper meanings of these appropriations or to evaluate their significance for library users in large part because it has yet to harness the ideas of many critical theorists whose thinking now dominates so much of the discourse occurring in other professions and academic disciplines this article constitutes a reexamination of the twentieth century history of american librarianship that is grounded on this thinking it argues that contemporary lis discourse is plagued with tunnel vision and blind spots that greatly limit the profession ability to understand the role of the american library in the present accurately and thus seriously affect the profession efforts to plan the library future  revised version of a lecture originally delivered october   at the library of congress the lecture was jointly sponsored by the center for the book in the library of congress and the american studies association which was hosting its own annual conference in washington dc  professor school of library and information studies university of wisconsin madison madison wisconsin  telephone    fax    e mail wwiegandfacstaffwiscedu libraty quarterly vol  no  pp   i  by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
 the library quarterly introduction my students have heard it so often they call it my birdsong the refrain comes from a set of numbers i carry in my wallet that are generated annually by the american library association office of research and statistics   let me give you just a few for  there are more public libraries than mcdonald a total of  including branches more children participate in summer reading programs at libraries than play little league baseball college librarians answer  million reference questions each year more than three times the attendance at college football games or how about this one americans make  billion visits to school public and college libraries each year about three times the attendance at movie theaters impressive statistics by anyone standards yet at the end of the twentieth century the ubiquitous library featured in these numbers remains one of the most understudied of american institutions currently we lack a solid body of scholarship that critically analyzes the multiple roles that libraries of all types have played and are playing in their host communities whether that be in educational institutions ranging from the elementary school to the research university in civic institutions such as the historical society the state library agency or the public library urban suburban or rural or in private institutions such as insurance companies hospitals research institutes corporations law firms seminaries art museums or music conservatories in each of these cases the library as an information agency has in different ways affected its users millions of them in the twentieth century who include americans of both sexes all ages creeds ethnicities classes educational levels physicalities and sexual orientations although all have used libraries over the generations to this day unless we extrapolate our own limited experiences to a much larger population we do not know very much about why or how that is unfortunate because without a deeper understanding of the american library past we cannot adequately assess its present and are thus unable to plan its future prudently yet evangelists of newer information technologies foresee a number of futures for libraries as if they are certainties twenty years ago f wilfrid lancaster was already predicting paperless information systemsespecially for scientists as inevitable  p xi william mitchell anticipates a library in which the facade is not be to constructed of stone and located on a street   but of pixels on thousands of screens scattered through the world  p  to a great extent predictions like these are made more plausible because the body of critical scholarship detailing the historical role and impact of all types
twentieth century american librarianship  of libraries in the united states offers an inadequate counterpoint at present this body of scholarship is too small too light too marginalized within librarianship and too easily ignored perhaps the time is right to apply broader more interdisciplinary and theoretically rich perspectives on that past in order to focus some attention on what i see as tunnel vision and blind spots affecting plans now being crafted for librarianship future the study of history can do that for you after all none of us can escape the fact that we are products of our pasts and as products we bring to the present all of history successes and shortcomings certainly we need to build on the successes but too often we fail to recognize the shortcomings in large part because the cultures in which we are immersed or to which we aspire tend to control the range of questions we ask about ourselves and our profession that is why constant reexamination of our past from alternative perspectives has so much value like a convex mirror it can show the parameters of tunnel vision and reveal many of the blind spots ken carpenter ably started this task in a  lecture titled readers and libraries toward a history of libraries and culture in america which broadly outlined american library history and its literature through the nineteenth century  in this article i extend his analysis to the present and in that analysis cover the twentieth century diversification of american librarianship in some respects however ken had it easier than me through  the world of american libraries which consisted of the services they provided the cultural forms they collected and the people who staffed and used them was much smaller and less diverse than it is today librarianship in progressive america   i begin coverage in  when the american library association ala gathered at the chicago world fair for its annual conference in july by that time the ala had functioned for seventeen years as a small but persistent voice for the nation library community in  it had adopted a mottothe best reading for the largest number at the least costwhich succinctly summarized its goal of making the american library a force for an ordered enlightened educated and  like this article ken carpenter presentation was also sponsored by the center for the book in the library of congress both are part of an effort to ground planning of a multivolume project tentatively titled a history of libraries and librarianship in the united states
 the library quarterly informed citizenry in  librarians for the most part agreed on the best reading ala leaders constituted an elite corps of wasp mostly male middle class professionals immersed in the disciplinary and literary canons of the dominant culture they shared a common ideology of reading bequeathed them by such intellectuals as sir francis bacon  p  and ralph waldo emerson  p  reinforced by others   and echoed in standard texts like mcguffey readers  for librarians that meant good reading led to good social behavior bad reading to bad social behavior and although they occasionally disagreed on individual titles to include in either category the academy and literary establishment from whom they took their cues often sent mixed signals once that good reading found its way onto library shelves librarians were convinced that by providing access to it they offered a neutral service to all americans  pp   at the chicago conference a significant manifestation of this ideology of reading was a model library a  volume collection of best books recommended for any small public library that a committee consisting of disciplinary authorities and librarians who had screened review journals for expert opinions had recently put together  compilers suggested a certain balance in subject categories for example  percent of the titles cited were classified history  percent biography  percent fiction the latter contrasted sharply with actual circulation figures however most public libraries had been experiencing circulation rates of  percent fiction since they opened that troubled librarians greatly and to help them combat this huge discrepancy the us bureau of education promised to publish a bibliography of the model library contents as catalog of ala library  thus making it available as a government document that on request congressmen could distribute free to libraries in their constituent communities but ala leaders did not spend much time discussing the best reading during their conference that problem they believed would take care of itself over time if only they persisted in  librarians were convinced that by inducing the public to read quality literature and consult reliable information about contemporary issues the library would inevitably contribute to the nation progress and social order dewey called this the library faith an ideology driven by a library spirit because that faith had sedimented into a professional m entalite by the late nineteenth century ala leaders felt it unnecessary to concentrate much conference time on the best reading instead they showed much more concern for the largest number at the least cost for years dewey at the time new york state librarian and in  the ala president had been pushing libraries across the country to adopt centralized systems such as a common classification scheme and uniform subject headings to increase the utility and effi

twentieth century american librarianship  little reason to question the judgment of these external authorities the model of library education they inherited had grown from apprenticing in the nineteenth century into a training program that by the s was sometimes connected to a major public library sometimes to a university as an undergraduate program and finally after  into a professional program located in a university graduate school before mid century entrance exams tested library school applicants knowledge of current events high culture literature and political and largely western history after mid century library school applicants generally needed a liberal arts undergraduate degree from an accredited institution where they had already been taught the best reading by academic experts because library schools generally insisted on good grades for example  on a  scale as a condition of matriculation the profession could feel relatively confident that its new recruits would share the right character with their predecessors    once enrolled in library schools they took a core curriculum usually consisting of cataloging and classification reference management book selection and often a generic library in society course the first four addressed institution and expertise the last was intended to socialize students to the library spirit and inculcate the library faith by celebrating the library as an institution much of this celebration was reflected in the literature of library history that with a few exceptions such asjesse shera the foundations of the public libray  and phyllis dain the new york public libraiy a history  lacked the kind of critical analysis necessary to examine the validity of the library faith not until michael harris extrapolated from the conclusions of revisionist educational historians and in the early s applied their ideas to an analysis of the origins of the boston public library was the celebratory model significantly shaken  harris argued that founders all of whom came from boston first families set up the institution primarily as a means to exercise control of the city new immigrants especially the irish his conclusions struck at the heart of the library faith but they also fit the times the ala had just weathered a revolt occasioned by hundreds of its younger members who saw in the principle of neutrality most often advocated by veteran librarians an excuse not to address inequities in library practice caused by racism sexism and homophobia a rationale not to confront a government bent on conducting an unjust war in southeast asia and a mechanism to give the library bill of rights a strict construction that rendered it ineffective in the fight to include alternative perspectives in library collections  with the organization of the social responsibilities round table in  these rebels found a home in the ala and with the publication of harris essay in  and other
 the library quarterly revisionist works that followed   they found a history that grounded a justification of their own actions for the next decade readers of american library history rather simplistically categorized new publications into two camps proor anti harris but for practicing librarians the quality of american library history scholarship paled in significance compared to developments in library practice when world war ii ended few library administrators utilized management principles in subsequent decades however library management literature made frequent reference to theorists such as peter drucker chris argyris and douglas mcgregor in  the association of research libraries established an office of management studies to improve library management through initiatives such as the management review and analysis project the academic library development program and the consultant training project  by that time under henriette avram leadership the library of congress had developed a standard format for machine readable bibliographic records called marc machine readable cataloging first for books later for serials and other formats  in  the ohio college association founded the ohio college library center under frederick kilgour leadership little more than a decade later the center had evolved from a local college network into a national bibliographic utility known as the oclc online computer library center inc because oclc adopted the marc records on which many libraries depended by  thousands of libraries around the world were using its database for cooperative cataloging by that time in the united states thousands of libraries of all types had developed online public access catalogs adopted packaged automated circulation systems and incorporated use of cd rom products into the provision of traditional library services   more specifically the public library world was affected in other ways as white flight drained the cities in the s urban public library circulation decreased in the largest communities by as much as  percent because those who stayed did not value the kind of printed cultural forms libraries routinely collected as much as those who left librarians had to alter traditional practices and devise new ways to address a different set of information needs  information and referral i  r became one approach most evident in the detroit public library tip the information place program it initiated in  there librarians developed card file systems listing social and county organizations and the services they provided their hours addresses telephone numbers and personnel many of these files were later converted to machine readable databases elsewhere public librarians took different approaches one approach to new circumstances was the evolution of federated library systems in which individually governed
twentieth century american librarianship  libraries volunteered to participate in joint efforts to purchase materials and share i  r services opportunities brought by improvement in electronic data processing accelerated the process another was the emergence of highly successful county library systems most notably in places such as broward county florida hennepin county minnesota and montgomery county maryland  all these developments were reflected in a set of recommendations detailed in the public library mission statement and its imperative forr service that ala public library association issued in  public libraries should step away from acculturation the document argued and instead become educational cultural information and rehabilitative agencies that celebrate and serve the multicultural heritage of their communities in nontraditional ways  elsewhere in the library world efforts to prepare different futures met mixed results some of which were reflected in the experiences of the council on library resources now known as the council on library and information resources which had been established by a ford foundation grant in  to facilitate research that had potential for improving library services and collections in the late s for example the council began pouring millions of dollars into mit information transfer experiment intrex project up to that time the largest nonmilitary information research project ever undertaken in order to reconfigure the research library of the future  because it was designed primarily by engineers and privileged the information they considered most valuable the project ultimately failed to produce the prototypical all purpose research library for which it was funded in  however the council formed a commission of preservation and access produced a very effective film on the deterioration of paper with high acidity called slow fires and joined with other higher education and scholarly agencies for example the brittle book program of the national endowment for the humanities to focus attention on the problem that affected the printed materials held by most libraries in  the federal government passed legislation requiring the use of alkaline paper in government publications  the application of computers to document reference retrieval began in the late s and by the mid s online retrieval was widely used by special librarians in government and industry for example in  the national library of medicine transformed index medicus a papercopy information retrieval system surgeon generaljohn shaw billings originated in the s into medlars medical literature analysis and retrieval system a computerized bibliographic system accessible through medline medlars on line  about the same time the defense department advanced research
 the library quarterly projects agency established a computer network when several years later the federal government sponsored a program to establish communication protocols to integrate multiple unique networks the internet was born in the s the national science foundation nsf funded much of the research to connect selected universities and research institutions through nsfnet to nsf assisted supercomputers one response from the federal government to this emerging opportunity was the creation of the national research and education network nren in  in anticipation of nren the association of research libraries the association for the management of information and technology in higher education and educom a networking consortium of colleges and universities created the coalition for networked information in  to facilitate scholarship by improving access to networked information sources  much of the activity then became subordinate to the national information infrastructure initiated by the clinton administration which as of this writing is still being played out recent efforts to merge promising networks into routine library services are indeed exciting but at the same time it is important to remember that the types of information processed by these networks are not universal and do not encompass information in all its cultural forms assessing the present tunnel vision and blind spots so now we stand at the end of one century looking to prepare for the next what guidance can the existing literature on the twentiethcentury history of american libraries provide on the one hand i am cheered by recent developments in american library history which has begun to mature into a more richly analytical more deeply contextualized literature works such asjane aikin rosenberg the nation great library herbert putnam and the library of congress    joanne e passet cultural crusaders women librarians in the american west    deanna b marcum good books in a country home the public library as cultural force in hagerstown maryland   abigail van slyck free to all carnegie libraries and american culture    and louise s robbins censorship and the american library the american library association response to threats to intellectual freedom    and journals such as libraries  culture and the library quarterly under the able editorships of donald g davis andjohn v richardson jr respectively hold out much promise for the future on the other hand however i am uneasy about the size of the task
twentieth century american librarianship  before us from my perspective the field is too large for the number of scholars currently giving it scrutiny its research scope too centered on biography library expertise and big library institutions and its focus largely devoid of analysis of the impact collections and services have had on library users and the ways in which users appropriated both i am especially concerned that with few exceptions we have not given nearly enough attention to the impact collection guides such as booklist and choice have had on perpetuating canons or to the role libraries have played in the everyday lives of women children african hispanic and asian americans and working class people blind spots all but even among types of libraries scanning the literature of american library history reveals huge gaps in terms of quality and quantity for example in  the united states had  school and  academic libraries yet there is no comprehensive critical history or even a set of solid case studies to help identify their multiple roles and evaluate their impacts on the millions of students and faculty who used their services and collections in the twentieth century how can the school and academic library communities possibly articulate policy and plan for their futures without knowing what they have done well and poorly in the past in  every state in america had at least one state library agency that for most of the last half of the twentieth century expended millions of dollars to improve library services yet there is no comprehensive critical history of state library agencies or even a set of solid case studies to help identify their multiple roles and evaluate their impacts on the millions of citizens affected by those dollars again blind spots what concerns me even more however falls under the jurisdictions of public libraries and what we used to call special libraries but are now more frequently referring to as information agencies let me start with the latter first here i see a field evolving that is based on the traditional model of reference service that american libraries have sought to provide for most of this century  in it certain types of information valued by business industry and government receive most attention in part because each has invested huge sums of money to improve systems design absent from the discourse driving this field however are the kinds of questions critical theorists such as michel foucault  antonio gramsci  and jurgen habermas  and philosophers of science such as helen longino  margaretjacob  and sandra harding  ask about connections between power and knowledge which all agree is never totally objective and never disinterested to illustrate what i mean i took a cursory glance at the  citations in the one hundred research articles appearing in the  and  issues ofjasis in them i found no references to the six criti
 the library quarterly cal theorists i cite above and only a few to thinkers such as umberto eco and hilary putnam based on this rather unscientific survey one gets the impression of a profession trapped in its own discursive formations where members speak mostly to each other and where connections between power and knowledge that affect issues of race class age and gender among others are either invisible or ignored one also gets the impression of a profession much more interested in process and structure than in people tunnel vision and blind spots i think this also may explain why contemporary information science has generally failed to construct models of a personal information economy for individuals of both genders all classes ages ethnicities creeds and sexual orientations in order to see what information they variably obtain from printed materials of all types from cultural forms such as music film art and tv from their neighbors their school their church their libraries their government their friends their family even from computers and then to analyze how they appropriate that information in efforts to make sense of the world around them in their everyday lives  unfortunately with relatively few exceptions   researchers in library and information studies have generally not attempted to harness the kind of critical thinking that would enable them to evolve personal information economy models that my colleague doug zweizig pointed to in his  dissertation when he argued that for too long our profession has looked at the user in the life of the library rather than the library in the life of the user  p  his observation still applies the information science that has developed in the last years of the twentieth century constitutes an arena of study in which the technology to which it is harnessed defines the field like general reference work it is built on expertise not authority and to the extent that people information economy does not require use of these technologies within the culture in which they live current information science discourse renders them and their cultures invisible largely by ignoring both equally unfortunate is that information science and american library historians have not provided much perspective here all of this constitutes a subtext i read in the words of pulitzer prizewinning historian leon litwack who complained loudly about the priorities of the library system on his own university of california berkeley campus in our eagerness to implement the new information technology he wrote in the february  issue of california monthly there is no sense of the need for balance little or no awareness that  i adapt this from barbara herrnstein smith who talks about the concept of a personal economy that comprises an individual needs interests and resources  chap 
twentieth century american librarianship  different academic disciplines may have different needs not all of them fulfilled by the new technology we find ourselves instead embracing that technology uncritically without considering cost maintenance reliability and value  p  tunnel vision and blind spots american public libraries and to some extent school and academic libraries suffer similar myopia in large part because lis research in general and american library history in particular has not yet assimilated into its research scope the findings emanating from a growing interdisciplinary body of scholarship on reading    a major means by which people obtain information whether it comes off the printed page or the computer screen for the past twenty years it has been generated by some of the brightest minds in traditional academic disciplines like history and literature and new interdisciplinary fields such as cultural women ethnic and american studies and it has been published by some of the world most prestigious presses all of which have exacting scholarly standards i think our absence as a profession from this mix of voices reflects the tunnel vision of our contemporary professional discourse and constitutes one of librarianship major blind spots  this scholarship for which louise rosenblatt literature as exploration served as a harbinger the modern language association published a fifth edition of her work in  attempts to shed the rules and regulations by which we have previously judged our reading and especially the reading of popular fiction public libraries have been circulating by the millions for most of this century in order to look at and understand the contents of those texts through the eyes of the people who read them most these numbers have not significantly changed in recent times a us newscable network news poll conducted october    revealed that  percent of americans used public libraries in  and of that number  percent  million people went to check out some cultural form yet without knowledge of reading research recipients of a kellogg foundation grant who met in washington in   to discuss the future of libraries seemed unable to tease out the broader significance of a benton foundation report  pp   on a focus group that identified as its top two library services  providing reading hours and other programs for children and  purchasing new books and other printed materials and when a member of that same benton foundation focus group also criticized libraries for not stocking enough popular titles if you want to get the book that everybody is reading right now it is just not in she complained kellogg grantees and focus group organizers did not seem to understand what sociologist elizabeth long discovered years ago in her research that reading the same book even if individually
