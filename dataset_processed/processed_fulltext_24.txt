the challenges of cultural diversity in the recruitment of faculty and students from diverse backgrounds ejjosey it has been my professional goal to promote cultural diversity not only in the profession of librarianship and in libraries but in american society as well my association with civil rights organizations has helped me to work toward this goal acceptance of cultural diversity is very important for we live in a multicultural environment the multicultural environment is global within nations within regional sections of countries and certainly in various communities around the world in a multicultural community the library andor the information provider can act as a catalyst for bringing ethnic groups together by fostering acculturation through the provision of information and research resources about the various ethnic communities cultural diversity should be a concern of the library schools of our country because the minority ethnic groups are rapidly becoming the majority in many states by the year  it is projected that four cultural minority groups  african americans hispanic americans asian and pacific islander americans and native americans or american indians  will compose almost one third of the us population projections for the year  indicate that the combined total population of the four protected classes as defined by the civil rights act of  will be  this populae j josey is professor school of library and information science university of pittsburgh  volume  number 
the challenges of cultural diversity tion group will represent  percent of the total american population of     described in another way by the year  this phenomenal growth will result in these four ethnic groups composing more than one third of the us population from the foregoing projections it is clear that minorities are growing at a faster rate than the population as a whole and during the next three decades the proportion of the american population of white european ancestry will decline at a rapid rate the nation must recognize that by the year  more than  percent of the american population will be age sixty five or older since our society is rapidly aging and the youth of america are emerging largely from minority groups the future workforce of the nation will shift heavily to minorities analyzing the demographics further we find the following today young adults born in the s will be retiring from the workforce and depending more and more on state and federal budgets for benefits these facts have serious implications for america economic planning the educational system and library and information services this means that in the future the working population will be smaller than that of the retired and the unemployed and it will consist of a larger proportion of minorities since minorities will constitute a major segment of the workforce and will contribute substantially to the economic well being of the nation the united states government must be certain that its minority population receives a quality education and is guaranteed access to library and information resources further the minorities of this country must have the knowledge and skills to use the new technologies in the workplace as well as in every aspect of their lives the nation cannot afford to ignore the education training and library needs of its minorities cultural diversity in particular is concerned with the significance of ethnicity race and race relations in the workplace topics that have been largely ignored in many of our library schools and organizations at this point we should describe diversity what is diversity diversity in this context refers to the equal participation of men and women in all of our library organizations including library and information science schools regardless of their race ethnicity or gender statistics related to minority faculty and minority students suggest that library schools are not culturally diverse why is this one possible hypothesis is that there are some people in our library organizations and library schools who are members of the majority white population and who believe that racism or discrimination has been eradicated in the workplace therefore further effort at achieving diversity is unnecessary if you carefully examine the alise annual statistics you will find that blacks hispanics asians and american indians have not increased as a percentage of the entire population in library and information science education programs since the passage of the civil rights act of  while it is true that today we rarely observe overt discrimination in this country covert discrimination has arisen nevertheless and is just as mean spirited and destructive as the overt form one ray of hope is the inauguration of president bill clinton who has installed a cabinet and fall  
journal of education for library and information science subcabinet with members whose faces look like america it is my hope that library and information science schools will recruit minority faculty and minority students whose faces will look more like america than the preponderance of lily white faces that fill many of our library schools racism racism is a continuing problem in our country i don have to cite just the rodney king case in los angeles in another recent example a black police officer in a major city was working on an undercover assignment he was not recognized by his fellow white officers and they handcuffed him and beat him unmercifully the white officers were fired this example shows that even when you are working as a law enforcement officer within the system and you happen to be a person of color you are a victim not only of racist attitudes but also of the violence that racism begets how can one think that library schools are superior to other institutions in american society the race issue is still very pervasive and systemic in almost every walk of life in housing employment education voting rights and the administration of criminal justice in addition to our moral obligation to oppose racism for the sake of our future minorities must be treated fairly the world is diversified and racial and ethnic tolerance must be promoted we cannot promote racial and ethnic tolerance in our field when one race dominates in library and information science programs one problem during the last twelve years was in our country not having a leader at the highest level of government who believed in fairness and who attempted to right the wrongs that have been perpetrated on people of color last december the education department released its revised policy position declaring that most of the grants in higher education should be eliminated because they are discriminatory this came on the heels of a surprise ruling one year earlier by michael williams the department assistant secretary for civil rights which declared that scholarships given on the basis of race were illegal the department released this revised policy statement despite the fact that executive directors of nineteen higher education associations a host of college presidents and many professional library associations including the american library association had condemned the education department policy guidance and called it legally flawed factually insupportable and not in the public interest in addition the united states commission on civil rights also had urged reconsideration of this policy in a letter to williams the commission chairman arthur a fletcher said the policy sends a message    that the federal government is retreating from the vigorous and aggressive support of equal educational opportunities for minorities more important robert atwell president of the american council on education declared that the change in policy is unjustified it displays a total lack of understanding    and has the potential for doing signifi volume  number 
the challenges of cultural diversity cant harm to the success of underrepresented minori ties these kinds of activities at the federal level have sent a signal to the nation and to educational institutions that we no longer believe in equal opportunity you can forget the  civil rights act and you can forget affirmative action this sent a chilling message to minorities in this country that you don count and we are not concerned about you in my visits to campuses to recruit i have met many minority individuals who expressed frustration about this particular situation minority faculty is key to success how many minorities teach in the library schools of our country let us examine the makeup of the total faculty of library schools in   as reported in alise statistics as of january   there was a total of  faculty members teaching in all of the ala accredited schools of this number  or  percent were white there were  american indians  percent  asianspacific islanders  percent  blacks  percent and  hispanics  percent the statistics for all four groups are simply depressing african americans asianpacific islander americans american indians and hispanic americans constitute almost  percent of the nation population but are not proportionately represented in schools of library and information science only  percent of our total library and information science faculty are from the four groups combined the schools have very few minority faculty members i believe that this is the most significant piece of evidence that indicates that not much has changed and that something needs to be done in terms of recruitment of minority faculty  if we truly believe in having a culturally diverse faculty marilyn mobley who is an african american professor of literature at george mason university reveals that students of color look for minority faculty members on campuses she says black students on white campuses say hallelujah i finally found a black professor that is because they feel safe in our presence we are the ones to whom they can tell their stories of racism they feel like they can tell us what is happening and how the institution is affecting them personally response to people of color goes well beyond supporting and ministering to the needs of african american students mobley says that white students also seek out black professors to fill in the gaps white students now seek out black professors to help them understand things like afrocentrism and other subjects related to minorities mobley argues that the key reason that institutions recruit minority professors is that they recognize their worth in attracting and educating students of color as well as in educating white students whose underexposure to nonwhite scholars leaves them at an intellectual disadvantage mobley reminds us that it is occasionally difficult to reject the constant sometimes annoying call to serve as the do alls for minority students fall  
journal of education for library and information science even though that usually means that their white counterparts have the edge in writing conducting research and working towards tenure charles moody vice provost for minority affairs at the university of michigan believes that minority faculty cannot separate themselves from the responsibility to serve minority students but he urges all faculty of color to take every opportunity to remind white faculty and administrators of their responsibility also we have a role to play but we have to make sure whites carry their share of the responsibility as well    the name of the game is sponsored mobility it is critical that minority students have sponsors and mentors if they are going to succeed and the research is clear about that it is also critical that we can dump the load of mentoring on the few black faculty on campus students of color expect to see their counterparts on the faculty an asian student at occidental college in california put it this way we lack asian american faculty in fact we are having a difficult time finding a sponsor for the korean club no matter how learned or open a white professor or faculty member may be there are things that they can understand and we need to be understood in order to have a program of cultural diversity in our library and information science programs it is important that faculty of color be recruited and urged to participate fully in the school program of research service and teaching it is not enough for faculty search committees to lower their qualifications for candidates who are persons of color at the same time they cannot come back to the faculty and say that we have tried but we have not found any  they must have the evidence of what they have done and where they have looked for faculty whenjuanita kreps was appointed secretary of commerce by president jimmy carter the president in his remarks to the press indicated that he had great difficulty in finding women for positions in government when the president invited kreps to address the press she was asked why it was so difficult for president carter to find qualified women krepps responded as follows in the case of the search for women it was men who did the searching and i do think that we simply have to do a better job of searching for both women and minorities  schools of library and information science must be held accountable in terms of where they look for minority faculty recruitment of minority students an imperative access to information by disadvantaged minority communities in the united states will improve only with an increase in the number of minority librarians and information professionals minorities compose roughly  percent of the total us population but represent fewer than  percent of the personnel of american academic and public libraries a survey conducted by the ala office for library personnel resources in  reported that only  percent of  volume  number

journal of education for library and information science when a recommendation is made for more funding support for minorities this should not be construed to be at the expense of other population groups such a perception reflects institutional racism there is a great need for financial assistance if we expect to recruit minorities to our graduate programs the issue for library and information science schools is that they must agree that the recruitment and support of minorities is a national imperative if the situation of students of color in graduate lis programs is to improve meeting the challenge of diversity recruiting students and faculty of color is not enough if the library and information science education programs are truly to embrace cultural diversity there must be a support system that makes students of color feel that they are wanted and they are at home within the university environment in addition to minority faculty mentoring of minority students white faculty also have a very important role to play in mentoring and in establishing a support system to strengthen cultural diversity most of the schools have student chapters of ala asis sla mla and other library and information science organizations minority students should not only be encouraged to participate in these organizations but they should be made to feel that it is essential for their professional growth to become involved in addition to the regular student professional associations there might be a need for the students to organize a minority organization similar to the black caucus apala reformer or other ethnic librarian groups at the university of pittsburgh we have a minority concerns council mcc that is open to all minorities that are enrolled at the school it is a vibrant organization and last year the group presented congressman major owens d ny as its black history week speaker the mcc also invites minority library professionals within the region to participate as speakers for group meetings this gives students the opportunity to get to know other minority professionals for many of them come from communities in which there is no minority professional librarian the challenge of diversity is met when schools establish a regular recruiting program with a recruitment committee and a person or persons assigned to this task at the university of pittsburgh i am the chair of the recruitment committee how does one recruit time is of essence so i will not belabor the point i would recommend that you should look at a suggested recruitment strategy that i published in the fall   issue of the bookmark   highlights of this strategy include developing public awareness programs developing a funding program cooperating with large urban public libraries and major academic and research libraries creating a program for the retention of minority students and ensuring that a positive program is fostered in many instances you will find that there are a number of minorities who have never considered the library and information science profession therefore recruitment is essential  volume  number 
the challenges of cultural diversity the future is now how can we redefine our strategies and responsibilities for creating and fostering cultural diversity in schools of lis in preparation for the twenty first century the twenty first century is only seven years away we don have much time what current and future scenarios must we develop for the recruitment of minority faculty and students to our schools it is not enough just to add or alter one or two courses for we must make the total environment one in which there is an appreciation of persons from the various cultures and their contribution to the information profession and to the information society most minority students come from financially poor backgrounds and therefore schools will need money to recruit them as well as support them if you are going to recruit minority faculty there is a need for more funding for this purpose as well there are many universities in this country that have fund raising campaigns but when we consider these universities we never hear of any of the funds being targeted for the recruitment of students of color or for the recruitment of faculty of color library and information science schools can take the lead and urge their administrations and their development offices to designate some of the money that is coming into universities for the recruitment and retention of students and faculty of color you may wish to propose this at your next faculty meeting i serve as a representative of the university of pittsburgh senate on the university of pittsburgh board of trustees faculty committee on affirmative action at its december  meeting the chancellor of the university revealed a new program that the university put in place during the spring of  advertisements have been placed in the chronicle of higher education and the other usual advertising media to recruit five african american junior scholars that is those who have recently received their phd degrees to bring them to the university to teach for a couple of years they are assigned to coteach only one course during the term and spend the rest of their time in research and publishing activities this effort was enthusiastically applauded by members of the committee because of the serious need in this particular area another solution that one may wish to consider you may have to begin to grow your own this is very easy for institutions that have phd programs but schools that do not have doctoral programs also have the opportunity to develop links with doctoral granting institutions they could provide funding for one of their graduates to attend graduate school or identify and cultivate someone at the degree granting institution who would make a good faculty member these are examples of ways to do more than we have done in the past finally i am optimistic about the future in november   traveled to washington to attend the fall retreat of the american library association committee on legislation there was something different about fall
