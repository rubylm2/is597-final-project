  the library quarterly teaching social justice as a topic in the curriculum is one way to begin addressing the holistic development of future information professionals it allows students to become more engaged and results in personal growth and hopefully a transformation of thinking such students will be better prepared and more successful in their roles as information professionals however multiple strategies are needed to raise the visibility of social justice and to further embed it as a value in lis education in this sense social justice also functions as an important framework for fostering critical inclusive and culturally competent professional engagement this article applies social justice as a theory topic and technique for transforming lis curricula and culture by exploring the implementation of social justicethemed courses and an extracurricular reading group about race and diversity that were successfully executed at the graduate school of library and information science gslis at the university of illinois urbana champaign in the last  years in response to student concerns stemming from a town hall meeting exploring multiple interventions in a shared institutional context is helpful for identifying synergies and shared challenges and contributes to envisioning holistic approaches for transforming lis culture into social justice culture what is social justice there are many definitions of social justice some focus on eliminating privilege and marginalization and others focus on upholding human rights still others emphasize the end of oppression and the formation of new systems of social political and economic justice for the purposes of this article and the definition that is used in the social justice class taught at gslis social justice is thought of as educating ourselves and others and taking action to change the status quo social justice is about giving voice to communities who have been forced into silence social justice is about equity and equal access rodriguez and cummings   once a definition is determined the best way to develop professionals who can both operate within that framework and also promote it in their communities is a tall but important order in their text public libraries and social justice john pateman and john vincent  suggest that librarians need to embrace equality and diversity focus on targeted needs based services know their community and its components be active in and collaborative with their community be empathetic with their community and fully engage and coproduce services with their community equally efforts at teaching theories of power contextualized by neoliberalism and capitalism in lis courses noble et al  provide a framework for thinking about the kinds of interventions lis professionals can make in service of social justice in broader social political and economic contexts though lis students may recognize and value cultural competency as an important skill set and educational focus kafi kumasi and renee f hill  demonstrate that knowledge gaps still persist in the actual learning of culturally competent practice such traits are not always intuitive and can be difficult to teach in the classroom but skills and strategies can be
