the li brary quarterly volume xxxiii july  number  voting on a library bond issue two elections in akron ohio  and  guy garrison at the november   general election the voters of akron ohio rejected a proposed   bond issue for a new central public library building at the may  primary election the following year they approved by a narrow margin an identical proposal this paper attempts to analyze the voting patterns in these two elections in an effort to discover ways in which voting on the two referendums can be correlated with socioeconomic data about the city and further to suggest ways in which similar analyses might be helpful in other cities as an aid in planning a bond issue campaign a bond issue referendum is a peculiarly isolated phenomenon because it puts a policy decision squarely on the individual voter most other decisions affecting libraries are made administratively or legislatively and are open to all kinds of modification and compromise as they develop once a bond issue is on the ballot it remains constant and is either approved or disapproved in accordance with the action the electorate takes on the proposal a bond issue election provides a possibility for a direct check by the people of the actions of library boards one of the few ways they have of doing so yet it appears that the electorate at least in larger cities rarely uses that check in a decisive fashion library bond issues ordinarily either win or lose by a close margin and if they fail are the victims more of apathy than opposition there is already in existence a considerable amount of recorded experience that can aid a library in planning developing and executing a campaign most of this is of a reportorial nature and does not permit much generalization the emphasis is almost always on the techniques used in promoting the bond issue what is missing is any theoretical framework within which it is possible to compare campaigns and election results so as to find basic determinants of success and failure which could guide referendum sponsors to a better understanding of how to direct campaign efforts some research on library referendums has been done but too little data  the research reported here was supported by a grant from the illinois state library 
 the library quarterly have been collected and recorded to permit many definite statements let alone hypotheses about such elections we are unable even to make a general statement that nationwide the voters have taken a positive or negative attitude toward library issues in recent years or that they have approved bond issues while disapproving increased tax levies the dearth of systematically recorded information about library elections makes it impossible to compare them either by section of the country size of city or type of election the study presented here is an exploratory one which tries to show  what kinds of areas in a city were most favorable to a library bond issue and  how a library can use readily available figures to find out where these areas are it asks questions and suggests areas for investigation rather than setting up distinct hypotheses for proof description of akron ohio akron ohio a city of nearly  is best known as the center of the rubber industry it early became a center for rubber manufacturing even before the automotive industry fostered the tremendous demand for automobile tires that led to the rapid growth of rubber factories the city tripled in population between  and  and became a one industry boom town it was very hard hit by the depression and labor strife during the  experienced another period of rapid industrial growth during world war ii and is today a relatively prosperous clean and economically stable city it is the heart of a metropolitan area of over  people and one of the chief industrial centers of the emerging megalopolis extending from pittsburgh across northern ohio to detroit physically the city is not congested or slum ridden having experienced most of its growth in a period when the automobile and other motorized transportation allowed cities to spread out small single family dwellings form the typical housing pattern and the proportion of owner occupied homes is very high as the suburban trend continues the city faces an incipient problem of a declining central business district and large residential gray areas that were built too quickly and too cheaply forty years ago and are likely to decline into near slums the city is dominated by industry and has a large proportion of skilled and semiskilled workers drawing relatively high wages it has always depended for a labor supply less on foreign immigration than on large numbers of workers coming up from the rural south especially from west virginia kentucky tennessee and alabama in many ways these residents with a homogeneous white southern background set the tone of urban life they tend to retain roots in their home states to return frequently and to have little stake in the future of the city this lack of concern for the city as a whole is not limited to recent migrants but can fairly be called widespread the deterioration of the downtown area as a shopping commercial and entertainment center is advancing as evidenced by numerous empty stores of the library services branch us office of education has announced plans for a systematic collection of library election and bond issue information beginning with july  data see also john g lorenz and herbert a carl washington report ala bulletin lvii january    harvey swados less work less leisure akron tests the six hour day nation clxxxvi february

 thle library quarterly highly organized made greater use of volunteer workers and adopted a grassroots approach to getting out the vote the methods used by the sponsors in the two campaigns have been reported by the librarian in another article and are not the chief matter of concern here from all evidence the library did a thorough job of selling especially in the second election where much more use was made of persons outside the institution to carry the message after the first election the librarian studied ward and precinct voting tabulations and precinct maps in an effort to uncover some leads that might explain the defeat and help prepare for the next attempt ward boundaries in akron as elsewhere do not always correspond to real neighborhood or community limits nevertheless it is helpful to examine the vote by wards because these sections of the city are relatively homogeneous and can be fairly well identified with neighborhoods of known social makeup in  the four wards most favorable to the bond issue were    and  the same was true in  when the same wards were again most favorable the over all gain city wide was  per cent the gain for these four wards was about the same  per cent the narrow margin of victory in the second election did not come about because of radical changes in certain wards but by a slight over all increase throughout the city a close study of the ward and precinct vote in the first election would have shown very clearly what to expect in the second election inspection of ward and precinct figures shows a very high degree of correlation between the way precincts voted in the two elections this much information derived from official voting records is easily available in most situations where library issues are on the ballot an analysis of this kind of data with subsequent generalizations represents the usual limit of inquiry into library elections a librarian is able to say that certain wards are strongly in favor that neighborhoods with certain basic characteristics are for or against that a second election closely following a first is very likely to produce a consistent voting pattern to measure these relationships more precisely one must move to another level of abstraction and attempt to correlate the vote with measures of the socioeconomic characteristics of the city analysis of voting by census tracts thus far the discussion of the akron library elections has been in terms of groups of voters wards and precincts rather than in terms of individual voting behavior to do the latter would have required extensive on the spot interviewing at the time of the election however quantitative data do exist in the form of census tract statistics that provide a great amount of socioeconomic information about small areas of the city through the comparison of census tract data and precinct voting figures it is possible to make correlations between voting behavior and certain socioeconomic characteristics this information is still in terms of groups of voters census tract populations unn on losing and winning a bond issue library journal lxxxvii december      precinct maps were supplied by the summit county ohio board of elections the akron public library prepared complete tables of ward and precinct vote on both elections from information supplied by the board of elections

 the library quarterly linear and with the eight tracts removed it increases considerably r  in   in  this variable is one of the best indicators of areas that voted favorably on the library issue in addition tracts that are high in educational level tend to have a higher percentage of registered voters and a higher turnout of voters voting on the library issue at both general and primary elections than do the tracts with lower educational levels tracts higher in number of college trained adults for instance have more adults registered r   and a better turnout of voters r   in  this relationship holds constant with both the full sample and the delimited sample median incomethe plotted data on median income and percentage of favorable vote show a curve with both lowand high income tracts voting for the bond issue and middle income areas voting against in general no middleincome tract was especially favorable and a number had only a   per cent favorable vote with the eight negro tracts removed the correlation becomes moderately positive r_  in   in  indicating that with the exception of the eight tracts a higher yes vote was associated with higher median income housing statusthree variables are used to measure the correlation between voting on the library issue and aspects of the housing in the tract area the variable measuring the percentage of homes that are owner occupied shows little relationship with the vote there is some tendency for areas highest in home ownership to be more negative in their voting except for the few highestincome areas there is no strong correlation between favorable vote and the percentage of deteriorated housing in the area but when all fifty seven tracts are included in the sample there is a tendency r  in  for a more favorable vote to come from tracts with more deteriorated housing this is accounted for by the favorable vote in the centralcity low income areas with these eight tracts removed the correlation becomes low and negative r  with the variable measuring median value of owner occupied homes the correlation is positive but not linear high value areas are favorable but among low value areas the vote is split and the negro areas whether high or low in ownership tend to be favorable while all other low value areas are negative occupational statusthe two variables measuring occupational status in the census tracts are among those that show a high degree of association with percentage of favorable vote on the library elections the correlation between favorable vote and per cent of professional technical and managerial workers in the tract is positive in both elections and with both samples in the  election r   with the entire sample and  with the limited sample a knowledge of which areas contain the highest proportion of professional technical and managerial workers would not only indicate potentially favorable areas but would also show areas where many adults are registered voters r   and are likely to turn out for elections r  in  the correlation between number of industrial workers those classed as craftsmen operatives and laborers by the census and the degree of favorable vote is negative areas high in number

 the library quarterly areas contain the people who have citywide interests who identify with educational and cultural activities and who are not as much concerned with high taxes as with higher levels of governmental services in general  how can one explain the fact that middle class areas are the least likely to vote for the library this opposition can be explained partly in economic terms but may reflect as much the alienation of the public library from the everyday interests of the ordinary citizens who fill these middle income working class neighborhoods and who have little interest in governmental services beyond the necessary and basic ones such as schools streets and fire and police protection  bond issues are usually retired from property taxes and do not directly burden the taxpayer who owns no real property to what extent does this explain the higher vote in central city areas and in low income areas where a smaller number of voters are property owners  the coincidence of high favorable vote and a predominance of negro residents in the seattle and akron elections needs clarification both studies report on areas rather than on individuals is it also true that the negro as an individual voter is more apt to vote for the library or is the high area vote a reflection of other factors  in a city the size of akron the library campaign no matter how effective is not likely to reach a large proportion of the voters many on election day will never have heard the issue discussed or have read about it in the newspapers a large part of the vote is not determined by the activities of sponsors or opposition but by existing attitudes toward the library and toward the city in general if this attitude is negative or unformed one can hardly expect the voter to vote yes and voluntarily increase his taxes  a successful campaign reaches those people whose pre existing attitudes are good and convinces them that the library bond issue is important and necessary a campaign is not likely to change attitudes or create attitudes for these reasons would sponsors of library bond issues be wise to concentrate on kinds of people and areas of the city most likely to have good existing attitudes toward the library  there is evidence that increased turnout can usually be associated with defeated bond issues increased turnout may be potentially dangerous unless the campaign is waged in such a way that the increased vote comes from areas known to be favorably disposed  in the extensive literature on voting behavior higher income higher education and white collar occupations have been found to correlate with highin this connection see the discussion of cosmopolitans and locals in daniel j elazar a case study of failure in attemipted metropolitan integration nashville and davidson county tennessee chicago national opinion research center and social science division university of chicago   on attitudes and apathy on public school bond elections see richard f carter voters and their schools stanford calif institute for communications research   a related study on public school elections is richard f carter and william g cavard influence of voter turnout on school bond and tax elections us department of health education and welfare cooperative research monograph no  washington dc government printing office
