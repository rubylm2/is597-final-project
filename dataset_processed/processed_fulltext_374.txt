movement for universal copyright    although the havana charter concerned international trade in its overall aspects those parts which might have impact on the united states copyright law aroused a sufficient number of interested groups so that their comments were given a place during the public hearing in april and may  a communication from luther evans to chairman john kee of the house committee on foreign affairs stated the position of the library of congress and the copyright office dr evans referred directly to the testimony of willard thorp assistant secretary of state for economic affairs who had earlier summarized the american laws which were inconsistent with the charter in all there were only six articles which raised any problem and three of these related to copyright in his memorandum mr thorp took up the principle embodied in each of those six articles of the charter showed its relation to united states policy and indicated changes in united states laws necessary to conform fully to the principle articles   and  of the havana charter were indicated as being inconsistent with the manufacturing provisions of title  united states code especially article  which stated that members shall not use their copyright laws as disguised trade barriers these provisions manufacturing clauses in effect preclude any book in english from receiving copyright protection in the united states unless every copy sold here above quota of  is manufactured in the united states the place of manufacture of a book is obviously not necessary to protect the rights of the author to the extent that these provisions deny copyright protection to books in english merely because the books are manufactured abroad rather than in the united states and because these provisions act as an absolute barrier to the importation of foreign manufactured books in english which are copyrighted in the united states above the quota they are inconsistent with the provisions of article  concerning the internal laws and regulations article  relating to import prohibitions and quotas and article  concerning disguised trade barriers therefore ratification of the charter by the united states would require changes in title  of the united states code to conform to the charter dr evans went on to state that the library of congress and the copyright office were opposed to the manufacturing clause and would be glad to see it eliminated he pointed out that the clause did not affect the importation of books for which copyright protection is not desired and that it was too effective in prohibiting the importation of books in english for which protection is desired a strong and comparatively new note was left by dr evans in his concluding question of whether the elimination of the anufacturing clause will do such serious damage to the american publishing and printing industry that an increase in tariff on books or the use of other measures    would be desirable dr evans also announced that his office had already been assisting the department of state in drafting a statute for outright repeal of the manufacturing clause the positions of at least two other witnesses before the foreign affairs committee hearing shed light on current divisions regarding the manufacturing clause the american book publishers council inc representing approximately  per cent of publishers in dollar volume of trade books published in the united states was represented by arthur e farmer their general counsel mr farmer explained that the publish us congress house committee on foreign affairs st cong d sess op cit p   ibid p   ibid pp  
 the library quarterly ers favored outright repeal of the sections of the copyright law which are barriers not only to free exchange of information and ideas but also to free interchange of goods among the nations of the world the publishers whom he represented believed that the legislation necessary for repealing those sections of the copyright law should be enacted simultaneously with the ratification of the havana charter the book publishers supported the state department contention that the manufacturing clause violates the basic tenet of the charter requiring the removal of restrictions on international trade but they foresaw that ratification of the charter without simultaneous repeal of the sections in the united states code which were inconsistent might result in chaos in the copyright status of american authors and publishers another representative at the charter hearing and one who had often appeared in previous copyright discussions was mr strackbein who at this time represented not only the inter allied printing trades association but also america wage earners protective conference and the national labor management council on foreign trade policy mr strackbein statement before the committee did not directly bear on the effect the adoption of the charter would have upon the copyright law and the removal of labor protection under the manufacturing clause his arguments against the ratification were based on two other points that the new organization would duplicate much of the work of agencies already operating in the international field such as the international labor office the food and agriculture organization the economic and social council of the united nations the general agreement on tariffs and trade and the point four setup instead of adding another organization and then appointing a oover committee to unscramble the overlapping international bureaucracy it would be better to avoid the proliferation of organizations in the first place mr strackbein further pointed out that if the charter should be ratified it would remove control over the tariff from congress to the executive branch of the government thus the principle of congressional responsiveness to the electorate as provided in the constitution would be broken down in this field he urged that the committee report unfavorably upon the ratification of the charter the copyright difficulties occupied but a short time in the hearing on the charter but they indicated the bitter fight the international trade organization would have in congress however the charter was never brought before the session its withdrawal was loudly lamented by senator malone republican from nevada who defied the administration to have the charter brought to the senate floor the failure of the committee to report out the necessary legislation to provide for membership by the united states in the international trade organization did not remove the copyright question from its involvement in reciprocal trade agreements publishers weekly reported in december  that legislation will now be introduced to create administrative machinery to strengthen the reciprocal trade provisions of gatt now already in effect with  governments  ibid p   ibid pp    ibid  congressional record st cong d sess xcvi may

movement for universal copyright    composers societies held in madrid in october  as a program commission of the sixth session of unesco general conference the fourth committee of copyright experts met in paris in june  twenty five countries had submitted replies to the supplementary request for views and these suggestions served as the basis of the committee work thirty specialists representing twentyfour countries prepared a preliminary draft of the universal convention as a result of resolutions adopted by the general conference the preliminary draft was sent to all governments of the world whether members of unesco or not with a request for their comments the draft with some alternative solutions and other comments of the governments served as the basis for the work of the intergovernmental diplomatic conference which was convened in geneva from august  to september   the crucial stage in the unesco program to foster a universal copyright convention had now been reached the convening of an intergovernmental conference constituted the first successful attempt to assemble the countries of the world in a meeting to establish such a convention throughout the many months of negotiations united states copyright groups had been kept well informed of progress toward the universal convention by luther evans at each step dr evans called a conference of the united states copyright experts including arthur fisher register of copyrights roger dixon of the state department and john schulman one of the representatives of the united states at the unesco copyright meetings as a result the positions of united states representatives at the international conferences reflected the opinions of american creators and users of copyright material the feeling among those concerned with the new convention and with the united states participation in it was that the areas of agreement were surprisingly large and that there was no point at issue that could not be successfully resolved but all this was dependent on one important change in the united states copyright law the provisions of article iii  of the proposed convention outlawed as a condition to copyright the requirement that a work of foreign origin must be manufactured in the country in which copyright protection is sought at the intergovernmental copyright conference in geneva agreement was reached among forty five countries including the united states on the text of the universal copyright convention along the general lines of the preliminary draft the convention was scheduled to come into effect when accepted by twelve nations including four non bern countries the conference also made provision for administering the convention by means of an intergovernmental committee through a unesco secretariat the signing of the pact on september   brought to an end the long negotiations for the new convention for  current activities in the international field unesco copyright bulletin iii nos       international conference of geneva for the adoption of the universal copyright convention unesco copyright budletin v no     draft of universal copyright convention unesco copyright bulletin iv no     universal copyright convention unesco copyright bulletin v nos     
 the library quarterly the united states the next step was to request once again congressional action on the manufacturing clause such action could not take place until the eighty third congress in the spring of  conclusion the seven years   found the united states in the role of sponsoring the movement for a universal agreement on essential points in copyright as a result of a foreign policy favoring participation in international organizations as the detailed unesco negotiations were traced it was clear that precautions were many but the situation was involved and the opportunity of singular importance the implications of a breakdown after these lengthy efforts to achieve a universal convention were of great significance for many years resentment against the application of the united states manufacturing clause to works of foreign origin had been growing if as a result of these long term negotiations under the guidance of unesco the united states did not join in the convention retaliation could be expected other countries might have adopted similar manufacturing requirements or they might have denounced copyright relations with this country the method of achieving international copyright protection by simultaneous publication in a bern country would almost certainly have been barred if there existed no other measure of progress in this period the realization that there was no turning back should be considered as one the attitude of the new administration in the united states toward international trade agreements with which copyright had become so much a part would in a large measure determine whether a bill to repeal the manufacturing clause would be successful in spite of great strides on the international scene and the compromise amendments to the united states copyright law in  the united states appeared to be no closer to becoming an adherent to a universal convention than in  when the chase act imposed the manufacturing restrictions there were however many good reasons for optimism the unesco secretariat was a functioning division in the united states a dynamic group of leaders with invaluable experience was constantly at work interest groups were featuring universal copyright articles in periodicals and resolutions and a wellattended annual lecture series sponsored by the copyright institute in new york included international copyright among its featured topics finally the united states government was committed to a foreign policy of aiding in world wide economic recovery the international copyright movement was no longer victimized by general apathy and it might easily be swept along to success with trade agreements the accomplishments in the years   laid the groundwork for possible adherence to the universal copyright convention
