promoting understanding of the affordable care act     fielding teutsch and koh  one of the key provisions of the aca is the requirement that all americans have health insurance or pay a penalty to help consumers find health insurance health insurance marketplaces were created and initial enrollment through the marketplaces took place between october  and march  parker hernandez and wu  despite the barrage of advertisements public service announcements and news stories about the aca and the looming deadline for purchasing coverage through the marketplace research suggests that many americans are confused about the aca and lack the information they need to make informed decisions about their health and their health insurance coverage green  parker et al  henry j kaiser family foundation b the impact of the aca hinges on the idea that the eligible uninsured will purchase coverage henry j kaiser family foundation a thus communication and outreach efforts are crucially important to enrollment and ultimately decreasing the number of people without health insurance to raise awareness and knowledge about the aca effective communication is critical health communication a priority of healthy people  provides the context for how professionals and the public search for understand and use health information significantly impacting their health decisions and actions healthy people   it is well documented that targeted evidence based media campaigns can have significant effects on health knowledge beliefs attitudes and behaviors randolph and viswanath  escobar chaves et al  bauman et al  noar  snyder  sharpe et al  hennink kaminski willoughby and mcmahan  the federal government and other health related organizations have developed media campaigns and other educational materials designed to inform the general public about the aca for example the centers for medicaid and medicare services  developed promotional materials that local organizations can distribute and sponsored ads nationally nonprofit groups such as the henry j kaiser family foundation b produced short videos and other materials that local groups can share through web pages and social media however the vast majority of outreach and educational work in most states is conducted by state and local organizations some supported by materials from national affiliations with advocacy groups eg aarp or the american cancer society community based or geographically targeted campaigns however may be more effective than national efforts particularly if the source is a trusted locally known organization or resource hennink kaminski et al  seth noar c n benac and m s harris  found that tailored or customized health related messages were an effective strategy for capturing the attention of interested publics and made the subject matter more personally relevant  for example a recent discussion paper published by the institute of medicine patel et al  highlighted the prevailing confusion surrounding the aca and the informationseeking needs of health consumers particularly those who are medically underserved the

  the library quarterly birthday the interviewee was also required to live in richland county and to have not participated in any recent information sessions at his or her local library to learn about the aca when contact was made with an individual through a cell phone he or she was asked a series of questions to determine eligibility which included confirming a that the number reached was for a cell phone and b that the individual who answered was  years of age or older a resident of richland county and had not participated in the aforementioned aca information sessions offered by his or her local library the telephone surveys were conducted by a public survey research institute at the authors university the main survey period was from october  to november   the response rate was  for the landline component and  for the cell phone component the overall response rate was  the final sample comprised  landline  and   cell phone users cognitive interviews with african american and white males and females were carried out using a draft of the questionnaire after finalizing the questionnaire pretesting of the survey by telephone was conducted and minor changes were made to the questionnaire before administering the survey the institutional review board at the authors university approved the survey instrument measurement understanding of the aca respondents perceived understanding of the aca was measured using one original item created by the research team howwell do you understand the aca responses ranged from extremely well to not at all a similar item was adopted from the henry j kaiser family foundations april  health tracking poll a to determine whether respondents had enough information to understand how the aca would affect their families the responses for this item were yes i have enough information no i do not have enough information or i dont know perceptions of the aca two questions adapted from the kaiser family foundations april  health tracking poll a were used to measure respondents perceptions of the aca the first question asked whether respondents had a favorable or an unfavorable opinion of the aca and the second sought respondents opinions regarding six specific facts about the aca eg the law allows children to stay on their parents insurance plans until the age of  the response options for both questions included a  point scale which ranged from very unfavorable to very favorable however for the purposes of our analysis to determine overall perception of the aca we combined the six aca responses from the second question into an index a  
promoting understanding of the affordable care act   knowledge of the aca we included nine questions focused on knowledge of the aca which were also adapted from the henry j kaiser family foundations april  health tracking poll a the item included nine statements about the aca three of which were false eg the law cuts benefits for people in the traditional medicare program responses for each statement were yes the law does do this no the law does not do this or dont knowrefused to determine residents overall knowledge about the aca items were combined into an index a   where each correct item was worth  point with a maximum of  points sources for aca information three items from the henry j kaiser family foundations april  health tracking poll a were used to determine the sources used to acquire aca information including a how often a respondent uses various sources to receive aca information never rarely sometimes often or very often b the most important channel for aca information and c whether the respondents primary source of aca information was providing mostly positive or mostly negative information about the aca to obtain responses  sources were mentioned to the participant such as cable tv local tv social media your doctor conversations with friends and family or your employer three additional items created by the research team were included to determine the likelihood that respondents would seek out information about the aca over the next  months their likelihood of using the library as a source for aca information and the effectiveness of various sources and channels for disseminating aca information the first two items used  point scales ranging from very unlikely to very likely the third item listed each source eg local radio separately and required respondents to provide a response on a  point scale that ranged from not at all effective to extremely effective demographic variables age gender education income employment ethnicity political ideology and insurance coverage were collected prior to our analysis we collapsed responses in demographic categories in order to eliminate categories with few respondents education was categorized as high school some college or college and above  income was categorized using a  point scale   less than           that represented the amount of family income in  before taxes employment was categorized on a  point scale that included employed unemployed retired or student respondents insurance status ie insured or uninsured and self reported political ideology ie conservative moderate or liberal were also collected

  the library quarterly efforts regarding the aca next partnerships were developed between the richland library and approximately  community organizations including local government advocacy groups health care providers and other service organizations such as the columbia housing authority the united way of the midlands the south carolina primary health care association and the american association of retired persons aarp representatives of these organizations now serve on a community engagement team facilitated by a nonpartisan health policy institute that provides insight into the needs and perspectives of the community in order to inform the research and work of the project participants provide critical insights into the community identify resources available to disseminate messages and further enhance implementation of communication plans communication strategies to reach target audiences focus group findings reported elsewhere bergeron et al  suggested that residents value health related information that they receive through interpersonal communication particularly face to face communication with a local resident who is familiar with issues in the community as a result we personalized the concept by promoting the community engagement project coordinator as the face and voice of aca information at richland library as illustrated in figure  we linked this personal approach into a series of appeals related to informing residents how they could meet the march  deadline avoid fines and qualify for subsidies under the tagline richland library has you covered with a limited budget the overall marketing strategy was a mix of earned or freemedia as well as paid media some tactics were developed to specifically target residents without health insurance and encourage them to seek information from the library by the march   enrollment deadline as survey results indicated that more than half  of richland county residents used local television news as a primary source of aca information and  perceived local news to be one of the most effective means of communicating about the aca one of our primary tactics focused on garnering news coverage from local television news stations and partnering with stations to better communicate with the public about the aca finally all events and efforts were promoted in the  richland library branches and on the librarys website in an effort to reach engaged active library users paid media flyers see fig  were inserted into utility bills mailed to  plus households in the city of columbia flyers were also directly mailed to residents in areas of the county identified by zip code where census data indicated that a large number of residents are uninsured missouri census data center  both targeted mailings utility bill and direct mail occurred between march  and march  in anticipation of the march  deadline flyers a total of

  the library quarterly discussion communicating with and educating the public about the aca can help combat numerous health disparities in the state through encouraging enrollment in insurance plans that can provide coverage for preventive care and treatment findings from this study clearly indicate that public libraries can serve as a hub of information on important health related issues as another way to communicate with educate and engage with the residents in the communities they serve this study is the first to our knowledge to report on the development of an innovative community partnership and to disseminate the results of formative research conducted to promote awareness and understanding of the aca in a local community the widespread dissemination of community created messages about the aca has been outlined as an important strategy for increasing aca awareness patel et al  preliminary results from this campaign suggest that promoting a trusted local institution such as the public library as a place to receive aca information and providing a personal contact whom residents believe to be trustworthy and knowledgeable and who shares similar ideas and viewpoints were effective strategies to market aca expertise and knowledge for example after the deployment of the water bill inserts direct mail aca print ads and television interviews that prominently featured the community engagement project manager phone calls to the library from residents seeking aca information increased exponentially from an average of  phone calls per day to more than  call logs indicated that the newspaper ads and the mailing inserts were the most often cited sources for how callers had heard about the library as a source of aca information on site visits to the library also increased and the library experienced a shortage of aca trained navigators in the days preceding the marketplace deadline findings from this study therefore concur with previous research suggesting that communitybased or geographically targeted campaigns may be more effective than national efforts hennink kaminski et al  findings are also in line with the social marketing literature and other health campaign literature stressing the importance of formative research in an effort to understand the knowledge perceptions and communication needs of a target audience noar  noar benac and harris  friedman et al  friedman et al  hennink kaminski et al  tanner et al  survey results from richland county residents were crucial when developing the key messages and communication strategies and allowed the researchers to better understand and respond to the publics attitudes and understanding of the aca comis et al  there are limitations to this study that should be noted first survey respondents were from one county in south carolina and results are therefore not generalizable at the national or state level second survey responses were collected in october and november  a time when there was an abundance of news reports focused on a republican politicians demanding that the aca law be repealed and b widespread problems accessing the aca
promoting understanding of the affordable care act   marketplace enrollment website healthcaregov these reports could have influenced respondents understanding and perceptions of the aca for example the mean aca knowledge score was  which is a far higher average score than published reports of reported knowledge on other scienceor health related issues hindman  kim et al  future studies should further explore the publics understanding of the aca and also examine aca enrollment rates in richland county and in comparable counties in the state of south carolina and nationally finally the authors acknowledge that although survey results informed the librarys promotional campaign due to the timely nature of the topic and the march  aca marketplace deadline there was not enough time to test our campaign concepts with county residents it is important to point out however that for the next phase of this project which includes developing tailored aca educational messages the authors plan to test messages and concepts through focus group research conclusion as this partnership among a public library system an academic institution and a nonpartisan health policy institute moves forward with aca related education and outreach after the march   aca marketplace deadline there are key survey findings that are important to consider even though survey research indicated that local television news was a most used and most effective source for aca information there were other sources eg doctors and employers that residents reported would be effective for getting the word out about the aca although the current campaign capitalized on local television news as a means to communicate about the aca our team should focus efforts on expanding our reach to other sources that survey respondents reported to be effective communication channels for receiving aca information further survey results revealed that mean aca knowledge scores were not surprisingly lower among residents who were uneducated unemployed lacked health insurance and had a lower socioeconomic status future work should focus on tailoring key educational messages to these residents who need the information and knowledge the most as the research team also conducted a series of focus groups in the county findings from the qualitative phase of our research will allow us to better tailor specific messages to individuals who typically face numerous health disparities adams et al  adams et al  hebert et al  kim et al  research findings and reported campaign strategies are helpful for health communication or public relations practitioners and scholars seeking to better understand how to promote awareness of and provide educational outreach about complex healthor medical related issues study findings will inform the development of aca messages materials and programs that can effectively inform residents in richland county as well as other areas of the state in fact a similar approach could be utilized to effectively disseminate information about other important issues or needs in a community findings will be shared with other public libraries
