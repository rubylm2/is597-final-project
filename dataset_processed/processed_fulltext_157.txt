a user centered design for information professionals anna nookes schulze most information professionals would agree that user centered design makes an important contribution to high quality information systems however there is no general agreement about how to define the term user centered design or how best to implement user centered design strategies in the development of systems and services this paper describes a wide range of meanings associated with user centered design in information studies and in other cognate disciplines and argues for a more coherent and widely accepted definition it proposes that a general definition of usercentered design drawn from the literature of human computer interaction hci could serve as a basic framework for system design and support interdisciplinary work it also describes some useful methods of implementing this framework in the development of user centered information systems the field of library and information studies lis has long taken pride in its rich tradition of user centered systems and services in recent years the idea of user centeredness has become exceeding popular in the literature of this discipline and many cognate disciplines as well user centered user centric and user focused are all expressions to be found in the spoken and written communication of scholars of every stripe although user centered design is widely supported in theory in practice its conceptualization and implementation differ widely hci specialist john karat has remarked that much like family values the term user centered design has become a concept that everyone subscribes to but for which there seems to be no agreed upon definition the meaning of user centered design is extraordinarily diverse and depends greatly on the discipline background and research interests of its proponents this paper introduces the concept of user centered design and its broad range of meanings across disciplines it suggests ways in which information professionals can draw from a more interdisciplinary perspective on user centered design finally it outlines an approach to user centered design from the literature of hci that can be readily adapted by information professionals for the design of user centered information systems user centered design there are many fields and subfields that interact in the design and implementation of information systems information retrieval information needs and uses hci and systems engineering are just a few in these and many other fields the concept of user centered design is endowed with a diverse range of both    volume  number 
user centered design for information professionals    about the author anna noakes schulze is a doctoral student school of information university of michigan common and arcane meanings in different contexts and circumstances usercentered design may refer to the following meanings  enhancing system performance  engineers computer scientists and information retrieval specialists have all tackled user centered design from the perspective of enabling systems to deliver better results to users research into cataloging indexing and textual information retrieval not least of all the eternal struggle to improve recall and precision together have all contributed to the design of systems that serve users better however many would agree that a focus on system performance metrics alone more accurately signifies a systemcentered approach than one which is truly user centered  designing for particular users  at the heart of this approach is an understanding that one size does not fit all different user groups have fundamentally different requirements as we have seen in the literature of lis both past and current the needs of novice users are not the same as those of expert  or even moderately expert  users users with differing levels of technical aptitude or working in different domains will not have the same needs this fact is explicitly recognized by researchers and practitioners in hci who posit user requirements gathering as an essential starting point in user centered design  understanding the user  both information and hci researchers share in a rich stream of ongoing research on user needs assessment the hci specialist arrives at an understanding of users and their needs by examining their  culture meaning the organizational characteristics and context in which they work  capabilities including their abilities competencies resources and limitations and  tasks or what users do in the present what they intend to do in future and how a proposed system may change the patterns of communication and work activity the hci expert can attain a profound understanding of users and their needs by examining culture capabilities and tasks in the aggregate these methods of understanding users and their needs have been refined and tested over decades of research understanding the user information professionals are also deeply engaged in understanding the user although they approach this understanding from a slightly different angle they want very much to get into the users heads  to understand their motivations behavior and capabilities they want to identify the information needs that users may not fully express or even understand themselves they also want to be aware of the physical affective and cognitive states that users encounter in the spring 
 journal of education for library and information science process of information seeking although different the respective approaches of information researchers and researchers in hci can be integrated to great advantage finally user centered design can also mean  continual user input into the design process  this is the most common and comprehensive interpretation of user centered design in the hci literature as advocated by gould lewis nielsen landauer and many others this approach encompasses all of the meanings of user centered design listed above and places the users at the center of an integrated iterative design process that involves them before during and after a system is developed and built this emphasis on early and continual contact with the potential users of a system is echoed by shackel in his discussion of user centered design designers must understand who the users will be and what tasks they will do this requires direct contact with users at their place of work if possible designers should learn to do some or all of the users tasks such studies of the user should take place before the system design work starts karat maintains that all techniques that involve users in design can be called user centered design techniques however what best defines the concept of user centered design to his mind are two chapters in the handbook of human computer interaction by gould and by whiteside bennett and holtzblatt respectively gould chapter describes four principles for designing usable systems  early focus on users and tasks through direct and ongoing contact  empirical measurement ie testing against established nontrivial performance measures  iterative design in which successive prototypes are tested and refined and  integrated design or the simultaneous coordination of these principles throughout the design process these various descriptions of usercentered design give a sense of the wide range of meanings it is endowed with whether across or within disciplines researchers and practitioners need to be aware of these meanings in different contexts in order to teach effectively to work productively with other researchers and to communicate with others from the cognate disciplines concerned with user centered design there is an ever increasing emphasis on interdisciplinarity in the information professions however this concept is often misunderstood or confused with multidisciplinarity belkin makes a useful distinction between the two terms multidisciplinarity involves a bringing together of experts from different fields to work on aspects of the research problem most relevant to their own discipline belkin reminds us that true interdisciplinarity is a different matter altogether it involves a coherent melding of the theory methods practices and general expertise of many cognate disciplines within the individual scholar and practitioner as the various parties involved in user centered design begin to research and assimilate the literature of their respective fields one can trace the early stages of an ideological convergence the day may still come when we all speak the same language when we speak of user centered design what is lacking as yet is a comprehensive integrated theory of usercentered design that is applicable across cognate disciplines information professionals who aspire to be the designers of user centered information systems share a great number of natural advantages they have a volume  number 
user centered design for information professionals    long tradition of strength in the areas of document representation organization of information information needs and information seeking behavior regarding the latter they have dissected users search strategies examined patterns of query formation and modeled their cognitive states in the process of information seeking all of these strengths can contribute to good design of information systems however what has often been lacking in the resulting information systems is good usability in his influential book usability engineering nielsen defines system usability as multifaceted and comprising the following  learnability the extent to which the system is easy for the user to learn  efficiency the extent to which the system is efficient to use enabling high productivity  memorability the extent to which the system is easy to remember so that the user doesn have to relearn it after a lapse in use  errors the extent to which the system has a low error rate in general is free of catastrophic error and facilitates recovery from user error and  satisfaction the extent to which the system is pleasant to use for most users an information system that has good usability will allow for a quick assessment of what the system offers and how it works the user should be able to determine what needs to be done in order to obtain the needed information in a reasonable amount of time and without much duress the poor usability of many information systems may be due to an approach to the design of information systems that emphasizes function system features over form interface design information professionals tend to focus attention primarily on designing the system functionality such as the choice of access points boolean searching truncation stemming proximity and adjacency operators and many others users are offered a choice of modes or techniques in their information searching tasks  browsing and direct searching keyword and field delimited queries and so on unfortunately this level of care and attention does not always extend to the design of user interfaces for these systems information professionals are often guilty of making information systems that are confusing unintuitive and unhelpful for the users they mean to serve for good usability it is essential that the system form give consideration to its function the single most crucial role of the user interface is to communicate the value of the system to the user from the user perspective the interface is the system a good interface directs the user attention to important information makes it obvious what a user needs to do and provides help and guidance throughout the information seeking process if the interface fails to accomplish these objectives the user may perceive the overall system as a failure  no matter how well its functionality was designed what information professionals can and should do is draw relevant knowledge from cognate disciplines such as hci so as to enhance their ability to provide useful efficient and timely access to information this cognate knowledge can be used to develop a more holistic approach to user centered design that balances the demands of system form and function university of michigan researchers gary and judy olson have defined usercentered design in a way that embodies the meaning and spirit of belkin definition of interdisciplinarity while providing a framework for the practice of user centered design user centered system design consists of observation and analysis of users at work assistance in the design from spring
