t he library quarterly volume xxxi october  number seven questions about the profession of librarianship introduction philip h ennis a decade ago pierce butler concluded that librarianship could not be considered a profession three deficiencies he said barred the way first there were no abstract principles behind library science and a failure to develop general theoretical guides to practice precluded full professionalization second the practice of librarianship was too quickly learned it lacked the special skills and understanding based on long training third there was no generally accepted and specifically inculcated humanistic learning that both guided and motivated the librarian to resist the strains of personal interest these observations bear the mark of the gifted amateur butler was neither a librarian nor a social scientist by formal training alert to important problems insightful strong minded while the content of butler humanistic learning has never been clear to me there is a sense of what he means that pervades the proceedings of this conference his over all verdict moreover was probably right but for the wrong reasons by assuming that the line dividing professions from other occupations was a hard and fast one and by further assuming that an occupation could become a profession on its own simply by correcting the three deficiencies cited above butler inadvertently refueled the sterile debate as to whether librarianship is or is not a profession this twenty sixth annual graduate library school conference sharing a similar concern for the state of librarianship is premised on quite different assumptions most important is our belief that the road to professionalism is a gradual one the line separating the traditional professions from newer aspirants being a band of grays rather than black and white of equal significance and indeed underpinning the first assumption is our view that an occupation becomes more professional through complex social processes involving negotiations with the public exchanging demonstrated mastery and control over services for their clients deference and trust involving negotiations with adjacent occupations for new allocations of tasks and involving constant commerce with an ever changing technology and array of social needs there is finally  librarianship as a profession librarv quarterly xxi october    
 the library quarterly another set of assumptions that need a closer look that professionalization is an unalloyed good that it is relatively costless and that all its consequences are either known andor beneficent the conference seven questions about the profession of librarianship therefore do not explicitly include such obvious ones as are we or are we not a profession why are librarians paid so poorly how are we to recruit better youngsters into librarianship how should we resolve the dilemma between the real research degree and the work permit idea in present day ma programs how can we tell the professional from the non professional task it is not that these questions are irrelevant or wrong more might be learned though if we were to take a different perspective and view the state of librarianship in the context of other occupations in the light of new social science information about the world of work and in the confrontation of that knowledge with the increasingly self conscious thinking of librarians themselves in short if we look at the problem in a professional rather than an amateur way this is not a new trend almost every occupation aspiring to a higher place in the sun has at one time or another in recent years scrutinized itself critically librarianship does so constantly but rarely in an extensive or systematic way these graduate library school conferences for example spanning a quarter century of librarianship have never concerned themselves directly with librarianship as an emerging profession one reason for this neglect is a paucity of research on the topic revealing little research interest and consequently a lack of factual underpinning for our opinions and hunches but a fact as the playwright said is like a sack that will not stand up when it is empty it is hoped that this conference begins to provide the necessary theoretical orientation for the gathering and evaluation of the proper facts the seven questions themselves evolved from discussions between the co chairmen of the conference and from conversations with the entire graduate library school faculty developed as they were in this kind of interior dialogue the questions were not always accepted or understood in the precise way they had been intended i think five of the speakers even make some kind of disclaimer for the title of the topic they were saddled with the questions are all interrelated deliberately so because the social processes they are meant to describe are themselves highly interrelated so much so that the same points recur several times throughout the papers since none of the authors of the major papers had access to the others some things were overstressed others hardly seen at all  even the most sophisticated partisan of our assumption occasionally falls into the semantic trap of saying that librarianship is or is not or will or will not become a profession it is the paradox of knowing that growth is continuous but still distinguishing the boy from the man  the exceptions are landmarks in library literature represented eg by the volumes of the public library inquiry and such a recent studiy as that reported by marjorie fiske in book selection and censorship a study of school and public libraries in california berkeley university of california press   convenient if somewhat unrepresentative evidence on this point lies in the lack of thesis research on the profession of the ninety one phd theses accepted at the graduate library school to date only five could possibly be considered to have some bearing on the profession of librarianship
the profession of librarianship  in this introductory and at the same time summary discussion some of these less visible interconnections will be indicated the first question asks about the process by which professions delineate themselves from other occupations goode sketches the general range of social processes involved in this unplanned trial and error and sometime self defeating striving toward professional status one key to success is the creation or borrowing of a body of knowledge based on abstract principles firmly under the control of the practitioners who use that knowledge second full professionalization is characterized by a service or collectivity orientation typically manifested in a code of ethics and inculcated into the young practitioners during their term of specialized training goode like butler before him and for curiously similar reasons is not very sanguine as to librarianship acquisition of these two key attributes of full professionalization implicit in goode paper moreover is the injunction to turn away from the physician and lawyer as models of the professional style these two professions after all are crisis professions the layman health and legal emergencies are the professional routines while librarianship involves mainly routine and orderly behavior the challenge to the profession lies precisely goode says in mastering the increasingly complex skills necessary to collect organize and make available the world of fact and fantasy that is our literate heritage the ability and necessity of librarianship to capture and absorb the new technology of information retrieval and documentation as a highly visible example of this general problem was alluded to in several of the papers discussion of the educational prerequisites for such control and innovative leadership in this and related fields also echoed this central problem the second question developed by winger throws a historical shadow on one of the basic processes of professionalization that goode described the service or collectivity orientation for the developing concepts of librarianship that he traces from the assyrian librarian king ashurbanipal to the present are actually a series of assertions and re assertions of the specific content of that service orientation the kinds of service to be rendered and to what kind of clientele need redefinition through the centuries as the technology of books and libraries changes as the nature and needs of readers change but above all as the individual librarians attempt to solve the persistent dilemmas of their work in a particular fashion these dilemmas still exist today and are being resolved in a myriad of ways but what has become problematical is what winger calls the social equivalent of the personal dedication and zeal which characterized the earlier creative librarians in identifying this key question of the social equivalent of individual dedication he harks back not only to goode point about the service or collectivity orientation of a profession but to butler humanistic learning for ughes points out in his paper in addition that these most frequently used models of a profession are nineteenth century models wherein the doctor and patient or lawyer and client are seen as socially isolated atoms the picture of the free professional he says was hardly true then it is definitely misleading now  probably the highest ranking librarian known making the history of librarianship thereby a long spiral of downward mobility
 the library quarterly this is i believe the meaning of that term winger paper also connects with two subsequent questions in the conference one dealing with education it is in their training that the future professionals service orientation must be inculcated and at the same time he points to the professional association implying not only its co ordinating role the profession brains but its value role the profession conscience the importance of these two integrative institutionsprofessional schools and professional associations lies in their dampening of the centrifugal forces of specialization another of the conference questions three of the seven questions are peculiarly intertwined professional education the diversity of ports of entry into librarianship and the librarian chronic concern for social status hughes paper immediately relates problems of professional education with problems of status upgrading educational requirements and content is seen as a key lever in raising occupational prestige but yields some consequences which strain the fragile and hastily evolved educational institutions and indeed engender important tensions throughout the entire educational system the dilemma of practical affairs and pure scholarship or research appears concretely in the cacophony of professional degree programs the transformation of the phd and the ma from validation of a research capacity to a work permit especially illuminates this dilemma hughes also makes the point that the variety of ways an occupation attempts to improve its status must be negotiated with adjacent occupations jointly responsible for the production or distribution of its particular service the problem of multiple ports of entry to the library profession discussed by parker reflects precisely a failure of accommodation with adjacent occupations one does not have to agree with parker emphasis on the strategy of exclusion as the profession response to job security it is impressive if only negatively to see the growing self consciousness of librarianship in respect to the control of training of recruits parker solution for the expansion of the one legitimate port of entry the graduate library school lies in the penetration of library education into the undergraduate curriculum this is a debatable and actually non essential part of parker argument hughes concern about the watering down of professional education is a relevant point here one that calls for further discussion so too to look forward for a moment does the prospect of premature and fragmenting specialization of interest implicit in such a program yet a single channel of education drawing people off at varying degrees of training is an attractive one for several reasons it might be able to overcome the second class citizen situation that exists at present both parker and reagan make this point effectively librarians who have not come into the field by way of the graduate library school differ from those who have in important ways resistance to research lack of activity and membership in professional associations different values of library service some of these differences may be minor others may become a major drain on the capacity of the profession to innovate properly or to maintain its values the implications of a profession need for a service orientation have been threaded from goode to winger to hughes they continue we see in parker
the profession of librarianship  a second attractive feature of parker one channel notion is that if applied it might help cut through the hopelessly tangled mythology that clusters around professional versus nonprofessional task assignments the failure of the profession to find a natural distinction between professional and non professional work is too complex to discuss here there is no doubt however that this failure exacerbates the librarian status problems if the professionals cannot be distinguished from the non professionals other than by external labels if indeed the work of non professionals and professionals is often identical then the tendency to appropriate borrowed status terms is enhanced lancour in his examination of the librarian status problem is unconvinced that such status borrowing especially borrowing of academic rank for librarians is the answer lancour also makes more visible the problem of an occupation negotiations with the public as a decisive element in changing prestige ranking what is clear if not fully articulated is that public images of an occupation reflect some basic realities of that occupation perhaps not all the realities the occupation would like to have recognized but at least those aspects on which the society for one reason or another has placed a high value if lancour is right in emphasizing that the librarian already has status rossi is also right in his emphasis on two of the realities which will hold down high public acknowledgment of that status the high proportion of women in the profession and the non creative nature of the librarian connection with intellectual matters the last two papers are also closely intertwined specialization mcglothlin says is an inescapable part of the modern world its consequences are in part the planned ones of increased ability to expand the frontiers of knowledge and to apply that knowledge more effectively but the unplanned effects jurisdictional disputes among and between specialties lack of communication and lack of co ordination among specialties grow apace a profession accommodation to these effects is a complex business requiring constant effort flexibility and clear leadership by specially designated elements of a profession the problems of specialization mcglothlin suggests must be met by the political process rather than by some purely rational scientific or narrowly efficient system of procedures the educational community is a major force in accommodating these negative consequences of specialization it does so not only by its political impact on a profession intramural battles but also as henkle suggests by providing the basis for a sound common educational background for librarians this point it will be noted implicates parker suggested solution for the ports of entry problem with the disjunctive forces of specialization the relations among these particular processes would repay serious attention proper organization especially the professional association is a second key instrumentality to this accommodation the discussants of mcglothlin paper illustrated perhaps inadvertently the utility of organized forums to accommodate the communication and co ordination barriers that exist in librarianship school librarians as mahar indicates are in a specialty caught between two giants their dilemma is in trying to fit both the perspectives of the teachers and the librarians the intellectual difficulties here are strikingly clear the
 the library quarterly social role of teacher intersects the role of librarian the political difficulties are also clear the professional association is the central forum in the handling of specialization and most of the other problems a profession faces as well ellsworth critique of the american library association for it is that and not any lofty view from the summit should be seen then in the context of the preceding paper his view stems from a mood directly antagonistic to mcglothlin recipe for the professional association role as mediator and compromiser ellsworth expresses the impatience with the organized apparatus reminiscent of veblen and the technocrats he wants to sweep away all the superfluities of bureaucracy and get the main jobs done efficiently this is a familiar cry one with considerable merit but is the logic of efficiency the proper test here or is clift more nearly right in his earthy rephrasing of mcclothlin injunctionthe fleas come with the dog yet there is an important even a political point in ellsworth substantive suggestion to reorganize the ala in such a way that type of library rather than type of function would become more dominant it is an echo of a major idea in hughes paper that each profession must deal with its adjacent occupation these dealings in many instances a political power struggle for control or leadership require the most powerful phalanxes the profession can create ellsworth is implying therefore that librarianship must fortify itself in its relations with city planners and politicians school administrators college faculties and all the other occupations librarians contend with by giving its senior and leading librarians mainly administrators more power in their professional association the decisive unit in dealing with the world he feels is the type of library rather than the function this makes sense increasingly so as the organizational arms race between professions continues but here is a genuine dilemma for the cost of strengthening the type of library component in the ala must be some loss in the tradition of functional organization and democratic participation which has characterized the ala in summary if there is any one theme that might unify the ideas of this conference it is the continuing tension between innovation and tradition by tradition i mean the service orientation the sense of personal dedication and all its attendant rituals and accoutrements including the genteel elegance and even the love of books by innovation i point to the knowledge base of a profession and its ceaseless change practice and theory must respond to new knowledge the important implication here is that education is a continuing matter professional librarians as individuals must have some systematic connections to the sources of new ideas both in and out of the professional educational center and the profession as a whole must be receptive to the new ways books and people may be brought together to an occupation seeking greater professional stature both tradition and innovation are necessary and each must be secured by the proper means failure to separate these means correctly can result either in the dissipation of the profession service ideals in a race for empty modernity or a freezing of its ability to meet new challenges by too
the profession of librarianship  tenaciously embracing old slogans and past glories library literature has had its sharesome people say more than its shareof research agenda without much difficulty each of the conference questions could be transformed into research projects comprising another such agendum while the importance of doing so seems clear research motivation can not be legislated it would not be appropriate to end this introduction without including a word of ithanks to the carnegie corporation of new york for the financial assistance which made possible this collection of papers and the conference for which they were prepared
