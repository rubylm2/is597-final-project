the place to go the th street branch library and the harlem renaissance sarah a anderson in the early s the th street branch of the new york public library under the leadership of ernestine rose played a significant role in the harlem renaissance movement by drawing on the resources of the community the library staff facilitated connections between writers and their readers with literary gatherings between artists and their viewers with art exhibitions and between playwrights performers and their audiences with theatrical productions but the library most significant legacy was its book collection now known as the schomburg center for research in black culture which has provided a permanent connection between a people and their history introduction on the corner of th street and malcolm x boulevard in harlem stands the schomburg center for research in black culture one of four research libraries of the new york public library over  million items constitute its collections which include over four thousand rare books and manuscript collections over twenty thousand items in its arts and artifacts collections over half a million photographs and prints and more than five thousand motion pictures and videotapes all documenting the history and culture of peoples of african descent  this article is based on the author masters thesis at northwestern university  written under the direction of sandra l richards of the department of african american studies college of arts and sciences and department of theater school of speech  associate professor of bibliography north park university  west foster avenue chicago illinois  telephonie    fax    e mail saanderson northparkedu  the other three research libraries are the center for the humanities the new york public library for the performing arts and the science industry and businiess library llibrary quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
 the library quarterly throughout the world with a particular emphasis on those who have settled in the americas and the caribbean besides housing these collections and providing access to its many readers the center reaches an even broader public through its seminars forums colloquia exhibitions film screenings and performing arts productions the present study however concerns itself with an earlier era of this remarkable library the early s when it was known simply as the th street branch of the new york public library see fig  in account after account of the literary activity that characterized much of what is commonly referred to as the harlem renaissance a period of prodigious literary output among black writers homage is paid to the th street branch and its head librarian rose langston hughes recalls coming to harlem at the age of nineteen on a bright september morning in  i came up out of the subway at th and lenox into the beginnings of the negro renaissance i headed for the harlem ymca down the block where so many new young dark male arrivals in harlem have spent early days the next place i headed to that afternoon was the harlem branch library just up the street there a warm and wonderful librarian miss ernestine rose white made newcomers feel welcome as did her assistant in charge of the schomburg collection catherine latimer a luscious cafe au lait  p i many such references in memoirs and histories of this period hint at the significant role that the library played in the harlem community but the mention is often little more than a sentence the purpose of this study is to offer a more complete picture of the important role that this library played in its community during the early years of the s and how its development into a major research library can be seen as a permanent legacy of the harlem renaissance an examination of what actually went on at the library and who was involved in its activities shows that it provided an essential connection between young writers artists playwrights and their public the library director rose articulated her visions of library service for underserved populations in numerous writings and in her administration of the library she drew on the social capital of the community to create a dynamic relationship between the library and its public programming at the library capitalized on a growing interest in black issues within the community with its literary and civic forums the art exhibitions of  and  and  for current program and exhibition information see the schomburg home page http wwwnyplorgresearchscschtml last accessed january   the library did not acquire the schomburg collection until  in  the library would not have been referred to as the schomburg collection

 the library quarterly the story of this library does not belong to a single figure such as rose or arthur schomburg or even to a group of illustrious figures such as hughes or countee cullen whose names we call upon to lend status to a once obscure branch library rather the real story belongs to a confluence of interests and a mission whose time had come the library provided a space in which a people long denied an understanding and appreciation of their own history and culture could explore what it meant to be black it became a sphere for public discourse within this domain voices representing a wide range of political and aesthetic viewpoints found expression and audience building on its community foundation and local interests the library grew into a world class research institution that continues to bring readers and inquiries from all over the world while much has been written concerning the schomburg collection itself and the new york public library acquisition of it in  information relating to the library during the early years of that decade is more fragmentary rose left a rich trail of her thoughts about her work although not about her personal life in her writings about public library service but little has been written about her celeste tibbets monograph on her that was published by the schomburg center  an article by bettyjenkins  and a chapter in elinor sinnette biography of schomburg provide the core of the literature treating rose and the th street branch  an interesting collection of ephemera in the schomburg archives provides a more detailed look into the activities and figures that made the th street branch such fertile cultural ground a librarian and her mission connecting with the community during the early years of the s the th street branch served a community eager for self expression and self knowledge one individual a white librarian named rose deserves a central place in the history of this extraordinary branch library but the ultimate success and legacy of the library are largely due to rose initial instinct and ability to share her responsibility with members of the community when she died after serving twenty two years as head librarian at the th street branch the new york amsterdam news published a laudatory obituary quoting her successor at the library negroes should honor her because she took a stand for integration at a time when it was unpopular  there is no apparent relationship between the ernestine rose of this study and the early nineteenth century women rights activist ernestine rose   ajewish immigrant from poland
the place to go  to do so  the article also credits rose for having obtained the schomburg collection for the library but throughout the article and in the large headline rose is mistakenly referred to as miss ernestine rhodes whether such a mistake resulted from either the oversight of a newspaper editor or a misunderstood pronunciation of her name it is somewhat fitting rose was not a self promoter she believed a branch library existed to become an integral part of a community and she was convinced that the less visible she was as the white librarian representing a municipal library system that would not even admit blacks to its board of trustees for another fifty years the more clearly she would enable the library to realize its own potential rose found the population in this area that needed to be served and the human resources within it that could contribute substantially to the process recognizing that librarians too often failed to make the connection between a library and its community rose understood how vitally important it is that a librarian should study people and their interests and that by connecting with those interests he or she can make the library a living vital force to touch those interests at as many points as possible through his book collection through the personnel of his staff through his method of approach his publicity and his activities of all kinds  p  when rose was appointed librarian of the harlem branch of the new york public library in  at the age of forty she brought to the position seven years of experience with two branch libraries in immigrant communities on new york lower east side the chatham square branch and the seward park branch rose enthusiasm for work in the immigrant neighborhoods is evident in a small pamphlet she wrote in  as part of a series library work with the foreign born in it she described the various activities and practices of librarians as they transformed their libraries into meaningful community institutions through reading clubs art exhibits debate societies and home visits but she never lost sight of the library patrons who constituted the heart of the library which is made a living force by the boys and girls with their clubs by the mothers who find their only intellectual center at the library by the newspaper men who find us doing work of which they wish to tell their readers by the teachers who bring their classes to us by the professional men who ask us to join their welfare organizations by the artists who offer us their pictures to be exhibited  p  the harlem community rose continued to champion the resources of community when she arrived in harlem she was an acute observer of her new neighborhood and soon saw the vital role a library could serve in it in her first year
 the library quarterly rose studied her community closely she knew of its churches that for example the sunday school of mother zion church had a membership of  and that the average attendance on sunday was  she observed more and more posters featuring black artists she recognized that the young men christian association ymca and the young women christian association ywca were important institutions in this city within a city the ywca having its own apartrnent house where new arrivals to harlem would often stay she learned of the six newspapers serving this particular population and she observed that everal artists of real worth work in harlem  p  but while the common denominator of race that so sharply separated the community from the communities of its white neighbors suggested homogeneity rose went on to explore the many divisions of nationality education language politics and even shades of color that divided the people she was well aware that marcus garvey the outspoken leader of the african nationalist universal negro improvement association unia and the distinguished harvardeducated du bois one of the founders of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp and editor of the cisis represented just two of the more noteworthy political expressions articulated in the community at the time rose also understood that she needed to sell the concept of a public library to her community a public library was not an institution one took for granted in  particularly in such a community it is to be remembered that many of these grown people coming from the south have never been permitted to enter a public library that they are welcome and that the place is free must continually be repeated  p  rose recognized early on the importance of the harlem churches to the community and thus their importance in marketing the library the churches welcomed the librarians who came to speak at the sunday schools the children librarian has found that mrs dana ife ofjesus is received with great enthusiasm by the children who know the stories by heart  p  the schools provided another promising avenue for reaching children and the location of the elementary school across the street from the library made it easy for whole classes to come visit the children room perhaps the most striking example of the library effort to reach into the community to advertise itself was in the practice of home visits in which a librarian would visit a home with a specific purpose in mind such as explaining the lending policies for children the larger purpose would be to invite the whole family to make use of the library and its resources  p  rose recognized the importance of providing black children with material related to their own race history and affairs the list of meetings held at branch libraries in the annual report of the new york
the place to go  public library mentions a high school boys club which met twice a month at the th street branch to study negro history in  and   p  in  rose reflected on the value of the book collection she had been developing since her arrival in  these books will foster the interest of the children and young folk in the history of their own race and inspire them to develop their own talents  p  placing announcements about library activities in the local newspapers and posting them at moving picture houses provided another means of reaching a public not in the habit of using a public library but it was the elite stratum of harlem society that rose identified as an essential partner and that distinguished harlem from the immigrant communities in which she had previously worked the library must gain the interest and support of this social and professional often wealthy group before it can hope to become an integral part of negro life these people are among our best readers and the books they read are similar to those of any cosmopolitan reading public examples of popular books among such readers were du bois darkwater  and lathrop stoddard rising tide of color  books exploiting the old time arky with his dialect and his antics as for instance e k means will be read but they are resented by the thinking selfconscious group  pp   race issues in library service writing in  about her work with the immigrant populations she served at the seward park and chatham square libraries rose stressed the importance of the entire staff learning about the culture of the host community accurate knowledge of the people their backgrounds social and human is the first essential by this i mean an intimate acquaintance on the part of every member of the library with the history traditions and literature of each nationality that the library expects to serve the artificial issionary spirit so lauded in the past will die as it should a natural death one cannot patronize and still hope to be accepted as a friend  p  when she arrived in harlem rose found an even more effective and efficient way of getting to know her new community during her first five months she hired two black staff members and encouraged volunteer efforts from community members  while employing blacks on the staff of the library was a principle about which rose felt strongly with regard to the larger issue of race relations she also understood the essential role that this staff could play in helping her connect with this community to which she had come as an outsider her black assistants helped her learn about the neighborhood and its people and were instrumental in bringing the library and its services to the people
 the library quarterly as well as bringing the community into the library while such steps sound rather obvious today at the time rose instituted such a practice she was breaking new ground in a library world that was marked by racism and would continue to be so for decades  rose was aware of the ambitious task she had undertaken as a white person in a black city influenced by that most illuminating book uames weldonjohnson the autobiography of an ex colored man she writes in attempting to make the library a part of this community  the chief difficulty has been and will remain i am convinced not in the alien and conflicting groups but in the barrier    which separates all colored people from all whites at the present time  p  the annual report of the new york public library for  singled out the th street branch for special mention two interesting and significant features are the progress in children work and the employment of colored assistants the introduction of the assistants has resulted in greadly increased confidence among the readers and has been well received by the whole staff  pp   the harlem branch was one of the top five branches in manhattan in numbers of new registered users from july to december  and the growth continued steadily by  five of ten assistants would be black early on however rose seemed determined not to see the harlem branch become a colored library for two reasons by creating a colored branch one was in effect denying blacks the use of the other libraries in the system second such a practice kept black librarians from working in other libraries  p  in an interview with the new york times in  rose was still making this distinction although work with the negro is the outstanding feature of the th street library miss rose is emphatic in saying that this library is not a egro branch e are a branch of the new york public library said miss rose nd our clientele is about  per cent negro  in an article on the role of race consciousness that was written for the southern workman she observed that the local public school and the public library were the only institutions in harlem that employed both black and white workers the ywca and ymca were staffed entirely by blacks while not exactly criticizing the all black staffing of such institutions she found the experience of an integrated staff critical to her view of progress on racial issues  rose optimism based on her own experience at the th street branch was tempered by a realistic appreciation of the problems confronting the black worker everywhere besides writing often during  see  annual report  pp   subsequent annual reports reveal that the number of applications for new borrowers cards rose steadily from  in  to  in  to  in  to a high of  in 
the place to go  these first years about her own experience with race relations at the th street branch rose also sought to find out how other communities addressed the issue of service to black populations she organized an ala roundtable discussion group which met for three years from  to  with librarians from around the country exchanging ideas on their experiences a questionnaire that rose had sent to  libraries throughout the country on the subject of service to black populations revealed that most cities with large numbers of blacks provided service in separate facilities staffed solely with inadequately trained black workers at the second annual meeting in  rose reported specifically on the benefits of having a staff of both races particularly for the white northern workers whom rose regarded as woefully ignorant the average white person in the north does not know the negro at all his ideas are preconceived and colored by sentimentality he sees colored people still as ex slaves pitiful objects grateful for his helping hand when he learns that they are intelligent struggling resentful and aggressive participants in the industrial and social battle of life his sensibilities are shocked and his illusions destroyed in this direction the last year has taken a long step forward  p  while the ala roundtables were well attended members were reluctant to create a permanent section to address the race problem in a more formal manner because of the perception that the issues and strategies to deal with them varied too much from region to region not until  did the ala add a statement to their library bill of rights that advocated access to all library services regardless of race religion national origins or legal views  p  as chair of the roundtables rose may have appeared a bit too threatening to her fellow librarians who preferred to handle their departments in keeping with their own communities standards louis shores a white librarian at fisk university related an incident at a library dedication in  in which rose outspoken positions on race relations so alienated several southern white librarians that she was removed from the program  p  shores had come to know rose when he worked at the main new york public library in the mid s and traced his own strong sense of injustice at racial discrimination to the influence of rose militant and sometimes confrontational posture  p  rose advocacy of an integrated library staff was unusual at the time and would remain an exception to the rule in most us libraries even those within black communities for decades while a few opportunities for library training at accredited library schools had recently opened up for example two blacks were enrolled in regular classes at carnegie library school in pittsburgh and one was accepted at the new york  for a detailed summary and discussion of these three annual ala roundtable meetings see musmann  pp  
 the library quarterly public library school rose worried that newly trained black librarians would be limited in the opportunities open to them for full employment anywhere other than in black organizations   p   besides employing black assistants on her own staff rose felt it important to try to place black librarians and assistants in white neighborhood branches such an exchange was made satisfactorily between the th street branch and the woodstock branch in the bronx rose successor at the harlem branch dorothy homer would recall that rose had found jobs for her in branches that were formerly staffed only by whites  p  and elise mcdougald took note of library work as a relatively new field of opportunity for black women in her chapter the task of negro womanhood which appeared in alain locke the new negro  she singled out the harlem branch and its black staff as her example capturing something of rose drive the vision of those in charge of the assistants training is illuminated by fires that have somewhat of a missionary glow there is an everpresent hope that once trained the negro woman librarian will scatter such opportunities across the country establishing branches wherever none exist  p  although she mayjustifiably have felt some satisfaction in the apparent success of her work with an integrated staff it must be remembered that the system in which they were operating was a large municipal bureaucracy which could prove difficult to work around by the end of the decade a period that is beyond the scope of this present study rose would be facing du bois charges of racial discrimination du bois wrote to his friend ferdinand q morton the first black member of the new york municipal civil service commission to enlist some political support in attacking what he perceived was discrimination in hiring policy or in practice at least in the new york public library system in a long letter dated february   du bois outlined the situation accusing rose of much hesitation and dilly dallying in recommending regina andrews for promotion to the position of first assistant  pp   regina andrews did get her promotion and enjoyed a long and fruitful career as a librarian at both the washington heights branch and the th street branch near columbia through the s when she retired with accolades for her distinguished service two years after the regina andrews case in  du bois was still exerting his influence in library personnel matters the correspondence among  these few instances did not turn into a widespread trend according to a poll by the ala by  only four library schools were admitting black students to their programs although a library school at hampton institute in virginia opened in  for the express purpose of educating black librarians see du mont  pp  
the place to go  du bois rose and the head of the branch system of the new york public library franklin hopper reveals concern among some of the staff and community that not enough black librarians were being employed  the fact that du bois was moved to become so involved in the library personnel matters indicates the degree to which rose initiative at the th street branch succeeded in obtaining the community investment in the library affairs by then the community rightly regarded the library as an institution of its own th street branch personnel rose writings and work with the ala roundtables reflected strongly held convictions based on what was by then only a few years of experience in working with a mixed staff but her career at the th street branch would prove her early assessments correct staff and volunteers were the key elements in the library mission to invest itself in the community and to bring about the investment of the community in the library one of the services which the colored assistants render the library is the knowledge of neighborhood affairs and people which they gain far more quickly than the members of the alien race even if they entered the district as strangers at the same time this intimacy has been of great advantage in making the library better known  p  the kind of involvement rose envisioned her staff making with the harlem community could be described as developing social capital robert putnam uses this term to describe those horizontal as opposed to vertical or hierarchical networks of interaction that bring together more or less equal segments of a community or organization he upholds networks of civic engagement such as neighborhood associations as an essential form of social capital the denser such networks in a community the more likely that its citizens will be able to cooperate for mutual benefit  p  although putnam is looking at the impact of social capital or lack thereof as in his later essay bowling alone in political terms it is an apt image for the kinds of networks that characterized harlem in the s and were taken advantage of by the th street branch the staff of the library provided the first line of access to this network one of the first actions rose took after her appointment as head of the th street branch in june  was to appoint a black assistant catherine latimer who would stay at the library for twenty six years  frequently referred to as the first black professional librarian in the new york public library system latimer had completed two years  robert d putnam bowling alone america declining social capitaljournal ofdemocracy  january   
 the library quarterly at howard university including one year of library training her interest in the black experience led her to develop a clipping file of selected articles that is still in use in november  rose added another black assistant sadie m peterson later delaney peterson training included only a year at miss mcgovern school of social work in poughkeepsie new york but she was an eager supporter of the library seeing it as the center of negro culture    the place for a chaucer to write  canterbury tale    a place for a poet to verse his new song for this great reading public  pp   her library work with children included school groups boy scouts juvenile delinquents and the blind a group in whom she seemed to have a particular interest when she left in  to organize a library for the veterans administration hospital in tuskegee alabama she continued this interest becoming a pioneer in bibliotherapy  p  while in harlem peterson used her social contacts and civic connections to the library advantage before leaving for tuskegee she received a letter from the executive secretary of the new york urban league who commented on the growing esteem of which the people of harlem hold the work of the th street branch i deeply appreciate your share in this  p  another newcomer to the staff was a puerto rican woman pura belpre whom rose recruited upon finding a spanish speaking population close to the library during one of her neighborhood walking tours  p  in  two more black women joined rose staff and helped further the connections rose wished to make with the community particularly with the young writers who were beginning to move to harlem nella larsen imes had given up on making any professional progress in nursing her field of training after resigning from the department of health in september  larsen imes volunteered for a few months at the th street branch and joined the staff injanuary  of mixed race herself she had found the strict segregation of the nursing profession intolerable black nurses were invariably assigned work in colored only clinics or hospitals or homes a practice rose may have had in mind as she fought the designation colored library  pp   in  larsen imes was promoted from assistant to children librarian in charge of the extremely busy children room besides providing story hours and books for school classes such as those the young poet teacher cullen brought over from the school across the street the librarians encouraged afterschool activities such as art workshops roberta bosely cullen cousin and a library assistant recalled putting an exhibition of children artwork in the library  pp   one of the would be artists was jacob lawrence whose work during the s for the work progress administration wpa would earn him considerable recognition among african american artists
the place to go  an avid reader and aspiring writer herself larsen imes found herself comfortably at home in her new setting and enjoyed the ever increasing activities at the library and contacts with young writers who were congregating there for an aspiring writer the th street branch proved to be a grandstand seat from which to observe all of the latest milestones in new negro doings  p  larsen imes eventually resigned in  for health reasons and devoted herself full time to writing her short stories were written under the pseudonym allen semi and in  and  respectively quicksand and passingwere published to considerable if not unqualified acclaim another black librarian who joined the staff in  was regina anderson later andrews the daughter of a prominent chicago criminal lawyer and educated at the university of chicago she had worked in a library in chicago she moved to new york after her parents divorce and applied for a job at the main library on nd street while rose may not have been surprised at anderson reception at the central library anderson remembered her surprise and disappointment when the authorities assigned her to the harlem branch because of her color but she soon came to appreciate her new surroundings and with roommate ethel ray nance secretary to charles s johnson of the influential magazine opportunity came to know many of the young writers and artists at work in harlem  anderson worked as a circulation librarian and helped rose recruit volunteers such as her roommate nance and jessie fauset a novelist and editor of the naacp the crisis these staff members and volunteers would provide an important connection between the library and its community and it would be a strength of the library that the personalities who met there often represented sharply opposed political or artistic philosophies although both nance and fauset were closely allied to harlem literary elite this elite was not a monolithic entity the men they worked for charles johnson and du bois were often sharply at odds with each other in their views of race matters particularly the portrayal of blacks in literature and the arts johnson heralded the new black writers who turned increasingly to black folk and the lower classes for inspiration while du bois and fauset represented the old guard who preferred to look toward the middle and upper classes the talented tenthfor their subject matter but all found a welcome at the th street branch programming connecting with the audience literary and civic forums the people most prominently associated with the harlem renaissance were its writers like many of his contemporaries arna bontemps
 the library quarterly moved to harlem to find the job he wanted to hear the music of his taste to see serious plays and god willing to become a writer on his first day in harlem he went looking for the public library because someone had told him it was the place to go  p  by  when bontemps arrived charlesjohnson had begun his magazine opportunity and du bois the crisis was also in the business of trying to encourage young writers with its annual literary contests but for several years the th street branch had already been informally encouraging young authors and providing them with an audience while that audience was admittedly smaller than one the national publications could offer the library efforts had nonetheless earned it the reputation of being the place to go the annual report of the new york public library for  lists meetings that had been held in the various branch libraries during that year like many other libraries the th street branch was the regular meeting place for such groups as the red cross the vocational school teachers association the north harlem community council and a music school over the next few years the number of such meetings would triple providing headquarters for the anti lynching crusaders the mozart choral society and a children good behavior club but it was the literary events and the civic forums with their weekly meetings at which prominent negroes and white men interested in the colored race are taking advantage of the opportunity to speak to neighborhood groups on economic and race problems that would leave their mark  p  one of the earliest speakers at the thursday night forum was james weldon johnson who talked in  about the haitian atrocities committed by the marines under the current us occupation  p  the haiti crisis was one of the first foreign policy issues that mobilized african american opinion and du bois and johnson of the naacp were leaders of the opposition  pp   other notable speakers included the white intellectual carl van doren black historian carter woodson jewish cultural anthropologist melville herskovits and the puerto rican born bibliophile schomburg  p   the library forums reached the audiences who came to hear the noted speakers but the press also often reported on such evenings in january  the amsterdam news described in considerable detail a talk by columbia university anthropologist franz boas at the th street branch to a large and appreciative audience on the pervasive myth of racial superiority  pp   although an official policy on intellectual freedom was not passed by the ala until  the practice of respecting multiple viewpoints on an issue was a priority for rose and the harlem branch was an

 the library quarterly in addition to providing a meeting place for literary activities and lectures on political issues the th street branch also provided public exhibit space for work by black artists beginning in  one of the first public efforts that rose made to reach out to the harlem community was the  art exhibition held at the th street branch an exhibition that was repeated the following year such an undertaking served several purposes by bringing together the works of black artists the exhibition awakened an audience within the community to the talents of their own to put on the exhibit rose enlisted the support of prominent members of the black community in new york both inside harlem and without such support not only strengthened the ties between the library and the community but also brought further validation to the artists and their work a few references to the  exhibit  p   p  mention works by such prominent artists as meta warwick fuller laura wheeler waring and henry  tanner but no catalog for the show is available in the catalog for the  exhibition forty two artists are named fifteen of whom were harlem residents with others from as far away as alabama and chicago and one studying in europe  some of the artists whose oil paintings watercolors pastels and etchings were chosen for the exhibit would be highlighted years later at the harmon exhibits w m farrow of chicago allan randall freelon of philadelphia and james l wells of new york the degree to which the artwork was or was not negro in subject and style was a matter of concern to both those observing the scene and those writing on creative literature and dramatic efforts by blacks at this time an article in the first issue of the new magazine opportunity on our young negro artists quotes an earlier review of the  art exhibit those who would expect such a show to be altogether unsophisticated and of primitive variety must have been disappointed and if it demonstrated one thing it was that all the influences which make an average collection of contemporary paintings a medley of styles and experiments have a corresponding effect on aspiring negro artists  the writer in opportunity concluded in the main there is noticed a rather significant absence of what artists frequently refer to as the egro motif the emphasis apparently being placed on general artistic themes  a quick look at the titles of the works on display in the catalog shows still lifes and landscapes dominating the subject matter of the show a shady spot near bladensburg md upper potomac peohouse for a foundation artwork grew thinner  p  the foundation director and assistant excelled at finding negro artists displaying their work and marketing it

the place to go  which seated two hundred people was filled for most performances  p  as with the visual arts there was considerable interest in the type of drama being produced by black playwrights du bois tried to encourage black writers by offering literary prizes and publishing their plays in the crisis but he recognized that in addition to finding an appropriate black drama to produce actors to interpret it a facility to stage it and an audience to view it there must be a change in the attitude of blacks toward the arts after instituting a policy of charging  to anyone wishing to produce one of the plays printed in the crisis he was surprised at the strong opposition he met in an editorial in the magazine in november  du bois chastised those who opposed such a modest fee finding in such a reaction a fundamental problem plumbers carpenters and bricklayers we pay without question the workman is worthy of his hire but if a man writes a play and a good play he is lucky if he earns first class postage upon it  p  a commercial market that is white market would not be interested in the kind of play that du bois was publishing a negro play that will interest us and depict our life experience and humor the krigwa players lasted only two years but it laid a foundation that other community theater groups would follow although she did not mention a date the librarian regina anderson andrews recalled meetings in the library basement to plan the harlem experimental theatre to be patterned after the krigwa players a few of us sat in the basement of the th street library one night and we began to talk about wanting to write and produce our own dramas plays and reviews of black people were on downtown stages but few were presented in harlem where the black playwright audience lived we had few plays to work with and almost none of recent date  p  library as public sphere the th street branch seems to have epitomized the kind of space rose described in her writings about community libraries it provided a space for inquiry and discourse for the display of artistic endeavors and for the production of dramatic works that would have had few other channels of expression those involved in these endeavors comprised a network of social capital within the harlem community the librarians and assistants used their connections to enrich the programming of the library and the literary and artistic aspirants took advantage of the institution to find new audiences today we might look at the library as an example of a black public sphere the german social theoristjurgen habermas used the term public sphere to describe that discursive space between the private and governmental
 the library quarterly realms symbolized by seventeenthand eighteenth century coffeehouses that accompanied the development of the bourgeois public in the transition from feudalism to capitalism the public sphere may be conceived above all as the sphere of private people come together as a public  p  it stood between the domain of the private citizen and that of the government providing a forum for debate of issues vital to the community and to the citizenry of a democracy and even though it was a state supported institution the library seems to have enjoyed a singular degree of autonomy in its programs and direction commenting on the black public sphere contemporary authors have expanded habermas notion beyond such bourgeois borders as the world of magazines and coffee shops salons and highbrow tracts to include a much broader spectrum of speech communities such as rap music prison the sports arena newspapers and mass political rallies  pp   but just as habermas public sphere was located in a specific time and place in history we can look for specific public spheres in harlem in the s harlem public spheres may have included the black churches the street corners unia rallies and the publications of the naacp and urban league as well as the more radical publications such as fire and the messenger but it was the library that proved capable of encompassing the greatest range of voices unlike garvey mass movements or du bois the crisis the library did not have an agenda or polemic to advance but it did provide a place for dialogue on issues of real concern to this community the political debates that took place in the library auditorium were obvious examples of this kind of forum du bois principle of integration though not subordination with white culture stood in sharp contrast to the extreme separatist fantasies of marcus garvey even though many in the library audience were sympathetic with or even active supporters of the latter the cultural debates of how blacks should be portrayed in the arts as seen in the discourse surrounding the art exhibitions poetry readings and plays staged at the library were no less vital to this particular population the th street branch was a public sphere that was truly open to its public and nowhere was this accessibility more evident than in its book collection the collection connecting with history in his forward to the new negro a collection of poems essays articles and short stories by young black writers locke observed that of all the voluminous literature on the negro so much is mere external view and commentary that we may warrantably say that nine tenths of it is

the place to go  exhibit  pp   rose was fully aware of the value of schomburg collection and wanted it for the newly created division of negro literature and history in october  she wrote to l hollingsworth wood president of the urban league to enlist his support for her view that the collection belonged in the library i have learned that schomburg collection is for sale    it would be a calamity to let this collection leave the united states where it should serve the purpose of enlightenment to both races and where such an educational process is so necessary the society of negro literature and history which is backing the negro reference library in this branch and the members of my staff as well as many community people have hoped eventually to procure mr schomburg collection for our library this is the only attempt so far as i know to form a collection of negro literature in a public institution and at the same time to render it of easy and popular access to all people moreover it is located in the greatest negro city in the world and will be safe guarded in every possible way to the people whom it concerns  p  by december schomburg was seriously considering offers to purchase his collection which was expanding beyond the capacity of his home to contain it in february  he offered it to the national urban league although specifics regarding this offer are unknown wood and staff members charles s johnson and eugene kinckle jones perhaps persuaded by rose arguments advised schomburg that the th street branch would be the appropriate place for the collection as the urban league lacked the necessary staff and facilities for it with a  grant from the carnegie corporation the new york public library purchased the schomburg collection in march  the official description of the collection was  volumes  pamphlets and many valuable prints and manuscripts and schomburg continued his collecting donating much more to the library  p  some of the oldest materials were the work of juan latino a spaniard of african blood who held the chair of poetry at the university of granada in the mid s and who was considered the best latinist of his time  p  the grant was not enough to provide a salary for schomburg to curate the collection catherine latimer who had been at the library since  was put in charge until  when another carnegie grant provided the funding to hire schomburg as the collection first curator at his death in  the division was renamed the schomburg collection of negro literature and history in the decades that followed the library activities and mission varied somewhat with its different administrators visions but by the s it was apparent that the collection needed substantial financial resources to continue its preservation and collection efforts in  the collection
 the library quarterly then numbering over  volumes was moved from the jurisdiction of the branch library system to become one of four research libraries of the new york public library under the new name of the schomburg center for research in black culture although the library was apparently not schomburg first choice possibly because he guessed there would be insufficient funds for such a purchase the final decision was much heralded a  newspaper editorial in the amsterdam news paid tribute to schomburg and his vision harlem acquisition of the remarkable library means that the negro does not have to remain in ignorance of the culture his forbears evinced in many lands before and since his subjugation a culture as brilliant as that of any people the future historian of the negro who does not avail himself of the schomburg collection cannot be taken seriously schomburg accomplishment is enhanced by the fact that he was unaided in his task even by the most liberal element of white people and that the selections are entirely his own  in  the first year the harmon foundation awarded its prizes schomburg received a bronze medal for his contributions in the area of education he was in good company that year as the other prize winners were cullen james weldon johnson and artist hale woodruff but while the collection received considerable notice from within the community and beyond schomburg was not without his detractors during his lifetime his position as curator of his own collection was a tenuous one and subject to renewal after an initial three year contract mckay commented on the controversy surrounding schomburg original appointment as curator of the schomburg collection when white library officials offered arthur schomburg the job to become curator of the books which he himself had collected the black academicians led by dr du bois fought against the appointment on the ground that schomburg did not possess a college degree  pp   conclusion many have questioned the permanence of the legacy of the black artists and writers who reached a wide and cosmopolitan audience during the  when harlem was in vogue referring to wallace thurman  at least three articles appeared in the new york times describing the acquisition    the title of lewis work on the harlem renaissance draws on hughes chapter when the negro was in vogue in his autobiography  william l andrews discusses the legacy of as well as the use of the term harlem renaissance in the introduction to his anthology 
the place to go  infants of the spring hughes commented that it was the only novel by a negro about that fantastic period when harlem was in vogue i was there i had a swell time while it lasted but i thought it wouldn last long for how could a large and enthusiastic number of people be crazy about negroes forever  pp   as we look at the schomburg center at the beginning of the twenty first century it at pears that interest in black history and culture is in no danger of dying out there can be no doubt about the legacy of the collection that grew at the th street branch during the harlem renaissance indeed it may be the single most significant legacy of that movement as it continues to provide the public access to an incredibly rich and abundant heritage that had for so long been ignored but the story of the th street branch library is larger than its transformation into a world renowned repository of knowledge it serves as a model of the library finding its place in its community any library advocate will claim that the library as an institution lies or should lie at the heart of a community whether that community be a school a university a town or large city but the degree to which a constituency values its library varies considerably from place to place and from time to time from the first few months that rose assumed leadership a leadership she readily shared with those around herthe th street branch became a vital cog in a complex community it served as a public sphere in which sharply divergent ideas about race art literature and politics could be exchanged while a mission statement as such does not appear in the records of this library its head librarian articulated her philosophy of what a library should be and do for a community through her words through records of the activities that took place at the th street branch and through the words of those who remembered it we have a picture of a library that mattered in a recent essay entitled achieving black economic self reliance the urban public library strengthens the economic base of its community james c welbourne asserts the total irrelevance of the public library among this constituency the rapidly expanding populations of black hispanic and asian american ethnic groups reflects the library virtual abandonment of the needs of this population in the past  p  the story of the th street branch stands as a bold exception to welbourne claim and can speak to contemporary questions of reaching underserved populations while this particular library is remarkable for the later accomplishments and for the fame of a large number of its users during the s the library original mission as evidenced in its personnel programming and collection policies laid the groundwork for its success indeed by the end of the decade it would assume a far broader role than
