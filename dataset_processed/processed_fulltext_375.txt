dear students becoming an archivist in a time of uncertainty and unrest ricardo l punzalan abstract this contribution to the special issue is written in the form of a letter addressed to current students in archives written in response to the november  election it considers how the archival profession can navigate issues of racial tension economic inequality immigration and hateful political rhetoric archival work is nothing if not critical and cannot be isolated from societal concerns this letter of personal reflection will consider the interconnections among archives political issues and professional practicenovember   dear students yesterday millions of americans effectively turned their backs on racial equality tolerance inclusion and diversity i woke up in tears this morning because i considered this election result a personal affront to my sense of decency and the ideals that brought me to this country that a man who campaigned using hateful rhetoric against immigrants and people of color who sowed fear and who emboldened white supremacists was elected as the next president of the united states has brought me to tears i cried because as an immigrant a teacher and a person of color who exercised the right to form a same sex union i felt rejected by a significant portion of this country this defeat has grave symbolic and practical consequences for me and for all marginalized groups of this nation i know what it is like to live under a repressive regime i grew up in the dark days of dictatorship in the philippines for  years ferdinand marcos and his cronies controlled mass media and all layers of government which condoned human rights abuse ironically this was all in the name of protecting democracy against the perils of communism criminality an undisciplined public extreme poverty and oligarchy under dictatorship protest and dissent were not tolerated so we spoke in hushed voices neighbors were afraid of spying neighbors the police and the military wielded so much power that they tortured and killed with impunitylibrary quarterly information community policy vol  no  pp    by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
  the library quarterlydissidents and activists disappeared presumably summarily executed families are still searching for missing relatives to this day i have seen how demagogues can twist facts and convince a subservient public that giving away their rights freedoms and values are necessary costs of democracy if i learned anything from growing up under a despotic regime it is that oppression happens gradually often founded on a platform of fear and with populist support my experience growing up taught me to never surrender my freedoms for a strongmans rule thus today im pleading for you to guard and value your rights to never give them up i rely on you to express your dissent and to firmly hold onto your values as archivists more than ever you must commit yourselves to becoming agents of truth accountability and social justiceand to remembering that if these values do not lead to specific action you are condemning archives to irrelevance a mockery of truth and worse the very tools of oppression it saddens me that there are those who consider truth accountability and social justice to be inherent values of the profession and therefore not necessary to articulate guard and make manifest in every action these archival values must be reaffirmed regularly in professional practice if i have learned anything from the history of our profession and my years of engagement in this field it is that the generations before us fought to achieve gender equality adequate representation of underdocumented communities in our collections and respect as professionals beyond the classist and gendered perception as handmaidens of historians if the statements given during the campaign are any indicator this newly elected regime is an existential threat to archives a person who benefited from a platform that rejects evidence denies fact and promotes falsehood will not suddenly become a defender of truth when elected he will only become emboldened with sense of mandate expect that he will act on his extremist rhetoric in a regime founded on twisting facts and peddling falsehoods agents of truth accountability and justice are under threat in this context you are under threat as are archives and it is important that you acknowledge this in a professional setting we archivists do not often enough acknowledge our emotions and vulnerability i think it is alright to show frustration and anger to shed tears when your personal and professional values are affronted i write to you to openly express my fears and in the process communicate that neutrality in this political climate will not save you and will only contribute to the professions irrelevance know however that there are groups and communities that are more at risk than you and that you still possess a measure of relative privilege allow your feelings of existential vulnerability to guide you in serving those who will be further marginalized by this regime including the poor people of color the lgbtq community and immigrants hence i challenge you to become the vulnerable archivist who will act as a cowitness to the struggles of those who have been in the margins of our society they need you more than ever
