teaching to dismantle white supremacy in archives  as i hope these stories illustrate these are not just issues of personal import although of course they are very personal but also professional issues that we must address as a profession they affect us professionally that is as professionals they interfere with our and our students and our colleagues ability to succeed with our collective ability to build scholarship in lis and with the lives of the users we serveand should be servingas lis professionals a student who is worried about where to safely use the restroom or who is being harassed by the campus police or being raided by us immigration and customs enforcement is less able to concentrate in class and hand in assignments on time a research partner who spends energy worried about being deported has less energy to spend on scholarship a field that is built solely by the most privileged within it suffers immeasurably a failure to acknowledge and address white supremacy explains the paradox of a field that claims to value diversity but persists in replicating whiteness in demographics values and practices hathcock  hudson  this article argues that in the face of disastrous political eventssuch as the election of a white supremacist protofascist as us presidentlis faculty members must intervene pedagogically to respond to the needs of their most vulnerable students and to address issues of structural oppression in the classroom in so arguing i will reflect on an exercise i developed to enable students to identify the ways in which white privilege is embedded in archival institutions and to collectively strategize concrete steps to dismantle white supremacy in their own archival practice as intellectual leaders in the field faculty must model behaviors of critique and resistance if we aim to train students who will disrupt the status quo of oppression in their information institutions as lis professionals this article also includes a printable graphic created by university of california los angeles is doctoral student gracen brilmyer who participated in the class exercise the accompanying graphic identifies concrete steps to take to dismantle white supremacy in archives we hope archivists and archival educators print out this graphic and display it prominently to serve as a visual reminder of our obligation to dismantle white supremacy in archival studies and archives more broadly teaching to disrupt the monday after the election i am scheduled to teach a session in my introductory archives course archives records and memory on collective memory and forgetting five days after the election studentsparticularly students of color lgbtq students and disabled students and especially those who inhabit more than one of those identitiesare still weeping in the hallways and at office hours many are angry and scared and ready to talk about their grief and anger and fear i want to give them a space to express this but i also want to move through this assertion builds on important work about teaching social justice in lis classrooms most but not all of which was created by students and junior faculty gilliland  pluralizing the archival curriculum group  caswell et al  cooke sweeny and noble  gabiola  roberts and noble 
  the library quarterlydespair to channel it into political action through their professional practice as archivists i want to do this despite my own personal condition of hopelessness to move toward what verne harris  calls a praxis beyond hope it is clear as class nears that i cannotshould notcontinue with my previously scheduled lecture instead i print out  copies of the two page handout based on peggy mcintoshs  white privilege unpacking the invisible knapsack grab a handful of markers and some giant post it notes and head to class if white supremacy is the underlying cause of a trump presidency as many have convincingly argued i want to do everything in my power to dismantle it in the small space and time i have i also know that as a white woman i have a responsibility to use my privilege to dismantle white supremacy and that i can model white antiracist behavior for the white students in my class i begin class by telling the students that i think we have a deep seated white supremacy problem in the united states as shown by the election results instead of the regularly scheduled lecture we are going to discuss white privilege and white supremacy and then do a brainstorming exercise in which we first identify areas of white privilege in archives and then strategize concrete plans of action for dismantling those privileges through our professional practice as archivists students get quiet and tense i have their attention i make a joke about how you know i mean business when i have giant post it notes and off we go i start off by defining white supremacy as a political economic and cultural system in which whites overwhelmingly control power and material resources conscious and unconscious ideas of white superiority and entitlement are widespread and relations of white dominance and non white subordination are daily reenacted across a broad array of institutions and social settings ansley   white supremacy is closely related to white privilege but white supremacy more precisely describes and locates white racial domination by underscoring the material production and violence of racial structures and the hegemony of whiteness in settler societies the concept of white supremacy forcefully calls attention to the brutality and dehumanization of racial exploitation and domination that emerges from settler colonial societies bonds and inwood   i discuss how white supremacy is a structural problem and stress that it is not a matter of individual choice that racist structures exist and that white people benefit from these structures despite their individual choices and attitudes taking peggy mcintoshs  cue i then describe white privilege as an invisible package of unearned assets enjoyed by white people in the united states whether they want to choose it or not i ask for volunteers to collectively read aloud mcintoshs insightful list of  white privileges such as i can turn on the television or open to the front page of the paper and see people of my race widely represented i do not have to educate my children to be aware of sys  asserting that white supremacy is the underlying cause of the election results is not to discredit the role of misogyny but rather to argue that those two factorsrace and genderinteract in complex ways it bears repeating that the majority of white women voted for trump for more information on white supremacy as the cause of trumps election see cox  huber  krell  and dyson 
teaching to dismantle white supremacy in archives  temic racism for their own daily physical protection and i am never asked to speak for all the people of my racial group when we are done i ask for reactions a student of color seemingly incredulous asks do white people really feel that way do you really get to do all of that as a white person i nod and some of the white students in the room nod in agreement one white student asks i know all these things are true and i feel bad about them but what am i supposed to do about it i respond that part of oppressive structures is that they are totalizing that they make people think there is no way out of them but people create structures people enable structures and people can also disrupt and dismantle them they must be actively committed to doing so to intervening to dismantle those structures in concrete ways which we would soon be talking about i then shift gears honing in on archives because this is an archival studies course and the students are training to be archivists i know this is only a small slice of the world but it is my sliver the one in which i have the most influence i tell the students we are going to use our giant post it notes do the following  list examples of white privilege and white supremacy in archives inspired by mcintoshs  list  for each point listed ask and answer the following questions what would liberation look like how do we get there what concrete steps can we take to dismantle each privilege as humans and archivists i hang up five giant post it notes at the front of the room and write an area of archival praxis at the top of each one appraisal description access and use professional life and archival education for each category i ask the students to collectively generate statements of white privilege students start shouting out contributions to my giant post it notes i write them down as fast as i can together we generate a list which i subsequently supplemented and edited as visualized in the accompanying poster figs  and  by gracen brilmyer a student in the course reflection i cannot claim that all students were fully engaged and on board with this exercise but i can report that much of the classroom seemed energized that students who had not previously i have since become aware of a visioning exercise melina abdullah does with her students she asks them to meditate on what freedom would be like what it looks like feels like and smells like and then asks them to describe what they envisioned with words or drawings melina abdullah information access and activism ucla information studies diversity council event los angeles february   there is also fantastic work on imagining as an is methodology in duarte and belarde lewis   figure  presents the full poster and figure  splits it into six sections color versions of both can be downloaded online with accompanying assembly instructions included for figure 
  the library quarterlyspoken in class actively contributed and that some students of color and lgbtq students expressed appreciation for the exercise after class for white students having to confront their own privilege can be an uncomfortable exercise that can result in defensive reactions or worse this heightened state of white fragility is a component of white supremacy as robin diangelo has written about extensively in fact i did receive a complaint about the exercise from a white student after class but i think we as facultyparticularly white faculty whosefigure  identifying and dismantlingwhite supremacy in archives poster designed by gracen brilmyer printer friendly color version available as an online enhancement diangelo  writes white fragility is a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable triggering a range of defensive moves these moves include the outward display of emotions such as anger fear and guilt and behaviors such as argumentation silence and leaving the stress inducing situation these behaviors in turn function to reinstate white racial equilibrium

teaching to dismantle white supremacy in archives  racial privilege partially insulates us from the consequences of critiqueare going to have to learn to live with that discomfort and cast aside our gendered expectations of wanting to please everyone if we are to create real change in the classroom and the world i want to openly acknowledge the risks associated with discussing issues of racial oppression in class especially for untenured faculty and for faculty of color it is not easy especially when many of us are ill trained and uneducated about these issues ourselves when many of our students and colleagues may themselves be hostile to addressing them and when we have few models of more experienced faculty leading the way but i also want to assert that the risk of not addressing white supremacy of modeling allegedly neutral behavior to students who will soon graduate and shape the profession is also a riska risk of furthering white supremacy a risk of maintaining the racial status quo a risk that i am not willing to take for myself or for the field roberts  carrying on business as usual in the classroom when the world is on fire is a form of culturally and politically irrelevant pedagogy it is uninspired uninspiring bad teaching if we cannot transform the discourse in our own classrooms how do we expect the students to change the field as new professionals or to change the world as humans conclusion in the months since the election the grief and anger have only intensified in the classroom students are still openly sobbing one of my students on learning about a new executive order that expands police powers asked the class through tears so does this mean my whole community is fucked i did not then and do not now have a hopeful answer for her but turning that rage into action is perhaps our only chance at collectively generating a different future for ourselves we cannot let the current political climate take away our ability to imagine otherwise even as our rights are being stripped away we cannot let white supremacy steal our imaginations the exercise described here is a first step the start of a conversation and not an end in and of itself i hope all lis educators reading this articleparticularly white faculty memberswill educate themselves about white supremacy and adapt this exercise to their own classrooms i hope lis student groups and professional associations adapt it and enact it and build on it i hope each archival educator student and practitioner prints out the graphic and posts it prominently as a reminder of the importance of our own actions in dismantlingwhite supremacy in our classrooms and our archives i hope that the action items here become dated over time as we work to dismantle white supremacy and i hope that archivists generate their own lists that respond to everchanging immediate needs over the next  years each of us will have our moral compasses i want to acknowledge the racialized and gendered consequences of bad student evaluations which disproportionately affect faculty members who are women of color pittman  lilienfeld
