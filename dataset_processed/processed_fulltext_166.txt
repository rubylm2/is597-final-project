teaching the cataloging of non book media carolyn o frost a course in the cataloging of non book media may need to include a number of diverse cataloging codes in addition to a wide variety of media this breadth of scope can benefit from a consideration of questions on the nature of media related areas of concern are the objectives of an access system for non book media and the means by which these objectives can be achieved the medium of film is provided as an illustration of this approach non book media are assuming an increasingly important role in library collections and the teaching of the organization of these materials has become more and more significant for the curriculum of library education while one can readily identify objectives methods and tools which are common to the teaching of non book media cataloging and to that of conventional cataloging alike it is important that one recognize some special considerations which arise from the nature of non book materials this paper presents an approach incorporating some of these considerations one such concern takes into account the fact that for many if not most students non book materials are less familiar as media than the medium of the book for this reason an examination of the nature of media can be a valuable component of a course concerned in particular with the organization and description of such media a second consideration is the lack of bibliographic standardization in non book cataloging making it necessary for the student to gain familiarity with a number of diverse cataloging codes frost is assistant professor university of michigan school of library science ann arbor mi  
leaching the cataloging of non book media an approach to the teaching of non book cataloging will be outlined in terms of the following components   the consideration of the nature of a particular medium  its physical and intellectual characteristics  the determination noting the characteristics listed in  of what is required for the effective use of the medium and thus for its organization access and description  the consideration of possible means of achieving these objectives and the examination and evaluation of existing means and alternatives these three components will be discussed briefly in this paper and an illustration provided using the medium of film as an example examining the nature of non book media a key concern in the teaching of non book media cataloging is how the various media now assuming prominence may be fitted into the framework developed for books and booklike materials l asheim in his introduction to the conference on differentiating the media provides some guidelines it follows that what needs exploration are the nature of the several media themselves each in its own terms and the analysis of the proper use of each medium based upon standards relevant to it the librarian traditional approach revealed by our use of such terms as non book and non print still tends to apply literary criteria to all of the media and picks as its touchstone the extent to which each other medium approximates the matter and manner of literary forms asheim remarks which urge a consideration of the nature of the media are valuable for the structuring of courses on media in general and can be applied here to the teaching of the cataloging of non book media an examination of the nature of different media is essential for a true understanding of the systems and devices which have been developed in librarianship for their organization and description such an approach can be of value for a variety of reasons since existing models developed for the organization of non book media have been patterned after the book signal questions throughout the course will be concerned with the suitability of this model one can ask if a range of materials as diverse as non book media can be dealt with in a system designed for a single seemingly different medium from this comes the question of whether there are generic qualities shared by most or all of the media one can ask if present codes or systems developed for the treatment of media reflect these generic qualities one can ask as well what implications the differences among the media have for the design of a standardized code which is to include diverse media in part this approach was anticipated by r s angeli in a discussion of the development of a cataloging code for books 
journal of education for librarianship from the objectives of bibliographical control derive the requirements of description from the nature of the materials controlled derive the elements of description from the necessity of describing numerous examples of a variety of materials derive the pattern of description from these propositions derive the criteria for a descriptive code objectives for media the second major set of questions derives from objectives set forth for the organization and description of media in cataloging one can begin with cutter familiar objects and these objectives can then be modified and reduced to a generic form which can then be applied to library materials in general thus for example cutter finding function which is designed to enable a person to find a book of which the author title or subject is known is extended to include media other than the book instead of taking the author title and subject for granted we can ask what is known about the object what can be easily identified or remembered about the object the tradition built up around western scholarship associates a book with the name of the person responsible for its intellectual content but not all media have authors in this sense and indeed the definition of authorship remains one of the most controversial issues in non book media cataloging one can consider extending the concept of author to creator as has in fact been done in two non book codes a croghan code of rules for    non book media and the association for educational communications and technology standards for cataloging nonprint materials instead of author as an access point one may find it useful to turn instead to the names of persons whom the user will associate with the object cutter objectives remain basically the same but in addition one recognizes the need to determine for each medium the person who can be identified by the user as associated with the work in this way all works associated with this person are gathered together title as an access point to facilitate the finding function can be extended to the broader concept of label and to problems considered such as generic titles for example sonata no  picture of an antelope and translations of titles a recurring consideration for media such as musical recordings and films which transcend language barriers some of these questions are valuable in leading the student to think of non conventional modes of access in addition to the three main categories of author subject and title there may be other properties associated with the medium that could serve as points of reference this point can be applied even to books as is considered in ws cooper article the potential usefulness of the catalog access points other 
teaching the cataloging of non book media than author title and subject visual materials for example have properties of color form and pattern and to some users a particular geometric structure or a particular shade may be of primary interest these aspects may be expressed verbally as access points and the items of the given property ordered under these access points in considering less conventional and alternative modes of access students are encouraged to look at existing systems and reference tools which could serve as models for example non musical collections of sounds can be analyzed for the properties of those sounds and these properties can be expressed in indexed terms points of access can be the subject represented such as locomotive or the properties of the sound produced such as high pitched whine access can be provided as well through the mode of symbolic representation of the particular medium a thematic index provides access to musical works through the use of musical notation the first few bars or principal melodic idea for a musical work can serve to identify the work as a whole here the user if he is familiar with the notation code can approach the material in its own terms for visual materials students can explore the capabilities of self indexing picture files and catalog cards with pictorial representations cutter second function for the catalog can likewise be extended to arrive at objectives for the cataloging of non book media this second function is to show what the library has by a given author or in a given subject with a more extensive range of media libraries have a more extensive range of properties by which the items in a collection could be gathered questions arise such as what is important about the medium from the user point of view can this factor be used as a collocative point should one gather together works of different media because they share some intellectual content in common the same work may appear in the form of a book record tape or microform can a message be transferred from one medium to another what about transfer from verbal to pictorial modes of communication means of achieving objectives with the objectives of a catalog in mind one can then proceed to the means by which these objectives can be fulfilled and the requirements for bringing about such means and from these to the consideration of codes through which a standardization of requirements is formulated at present there is a relative lack of bibliographic standardization in non book media cataloging the systems developed for the cataloging and to a lesser extent classification of non book media are in a state of flux in recent times no single code has yet assumed the authority which the anglo american cataloging rules has for monographs and serials instead codes emanating from different professional organizations eg 
journal of education for librarianship the canadian library association the british library association the association for educational communications and technology and the american library association as well as a number of codes with less authoritative backing but by no means without influence have competed for the attention of non book catalogers the second edition of the anglo american cataloging rules will in all likelihood be recognized as a national standard but it will probably be some time before the other codes cease to be used it would be ill advised in any course in the cataloging of non book materials to be heedless of the codes already developed these codes are of interest as well as foundations upon which the new angloamerican code will be based at the same time the acquisition of a mastery of these codes in the sense which is usually expected for the anglo american code is unrealistic and unnecessary instead it would be more useful to develop a framework from which to view the codes and their application a consideration of the characteristics of media and the implications of these characteristics for the organization and description of them can provide such a framework in addition the broad based analysis of codes has a value in its own right each of the codes can be compared and judged within the context of the requirements formulated in the course the survey of codes includes the anglo american cataloging rules aacr the revised chapters  and  of aacr  which may be viewed as having the official backing of the american library association and the library of congress the official codes of the canadian library association nonbook materials the organization of integrated collections and the british library association nonbook materials cataloguing rules and the association for educational communications and technology standardsor cataloging nonprint materials l  have more than academic value since they have served as sources of input for the new aacr in addition the less official codes of w hicks and a tillin developing multi media libraries and j t johnson av cataloging and processing simplified have had their influence upon school media cataloging the more theoretical and highly individual effort of croghan code of rules for    non book media has neither official sponsorship nor widespread acceptance in actual practice but there is an imaginative and stimulating discussion which accompanies the code and the original theoretical framework underlying the rules make it especially valuable for students altogether this assortment of codes presents enough of a variety of approaches and formats to make a comparative analysis valuable aside from the issues of cataloging substance the codes themselves can be viewed as having properties and characteristics  such as style language scope degree of consistency general principles and structure one objective of the course is the recognition that traditional catalogs 
teaching the cataloging of non book media are not the only means through which the catalog functions can be realized often the information in the card catalog can be supplemented by additional parts of the bibliographical apparatus reference aids for specific disciplines such as music the fine arts and for specific media such as films and recordings can not only serve as sources for information conventionally found in catalog entries for example verifying the name of a composer or author the title of an artist work they can also provide additional access routes not brought out in conventional catalogs for example enabling a user to find a film by the name of a director or performer on another level some reference tools can serve as models for alternative types of access systems as for example thematic catalogs in music or picture indexes in art the approach of the course is to consider first on a broad level the kinds of questions that can be asked about the nature of media in general and the objectives and requirements for access and organization the several codes can be viewed as a whole with respect to a general comparison of characteristics after this general view of the problems specific groups of media are considered theoretical and practical literature about a particular medium can then be examined and the relevant sections of the codes considered practical exercises in which students prepare catalog entries for specific examples of the media help to illustrate some of the theoretical problems in an actual cataloging context the example of film is given here to illustrate the treatment of a particular medium the students are first concerned with the physical and intellectual components of film as well as with the relation of the whole film to its component parts what constitutes the intellectual content of a film how is a film related to its script or the book on which the script is based what is the role of the sound track or the purely visual element fortunately with the recent recognition of film as a medium and art form in its own right there is an interesting body of literature on the film and on film theory students are introduced to bibliographic guides to film literature for example p j bukalski film research a critical bibliography with annotations and essays  as well as to specific works which consider the physical and intellectual components of film and modes of its production one such guide is l r bobker elements of film a number of discussions in the library literature consider the relationship of book to film for example asheim dissertation from book to film a comparative analysis of the content of selected novels and the motion pictures based upon them and the more recent article by v w wexman the transfer from one medium to another the maltese falcon from fiction to film keeping in mind the way in which films are remembered and identified by viewers the class can then consider objectives for a system of access and description what and who 
journal of education for librarianship is to be included in the description of a film and what is the priority of order to be accorded to the different elements of description the existing codes illustrate a broad spectrum of approaches to these questions exploring these differences of thought the class can consider the people involved in the making of a film and their contributions to its intellectual or artistic content does any one person have primary responsibility what role does the director play the editor cameraman etc how does the director role vary what of the movie was conceived written directed and produced by a single person such a question is justifiable in the light of the technology of the easily operated film camera which enables the layman to produce his own film with relative ease these questions about primary intellectual responsibility have relevance even apart from the issue of main entry since the problems of added entries and priority of elements of data must still be addressed in considering additional access points provided in supplementary reference sources students are provided with an opportunity to look at the considerable body of reference works on the film to investigate possible approaches of access for actors directors screenwriters composers as well as additional descriptive information for more extensive descriptive techniques and more complex modes of access of interest to a specialized film collection h p harrison film library techniques principles of administration is of value this paper has posed a number of questions which can be considered in the teaching of a course on the cataloging of non book materials the questions are designed to provide a theoretical framework with which to view practical cataloging problems in some cases the questions may illustrate significant aspects of problems with clear cut solutions in other cases where a number of alternatives are posed  either by the provision of options in the codes or by the presence of ambiguities in the presentation of the rules  the questions may serve as guidelines leading to the most appropriate solution in a given situation the questions are intended to serve the purpose of developing a basic understanding of the nature and unique qualities of the media being cataloged with these qualities in mind objectives for bibliographic description and organization can be determined which are best suited to the medium and the means of achieving these objectives can be identified and applied the approach is based upon the premise that an understanding of what a medium is and how it works will enable the librarian to evaluate and apply existing systems and to evolve future ones it is designed in the hope that the student will develop a critical method of thinking about media which will be both intellectually stimulating and of practical value indeed the development of a set of questions about the nature of
