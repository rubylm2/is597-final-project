introduction while it is doubtful that jane davies  adolf placzek  dina abramowicz  and emily reed  met in life they shared common bonds in death all four passed away in februarymay  and all four were more than eightyfive years old when they died all four were also librarians and it is because of their profession or rather the contributions they made to it that their obituaries appeared in the new york times nyt readers of nyt obituaries in early  were thus presented with four images of librarianship in a relatively short period of time what could they have deduced about librarianship from these and other obituaries of librarians we begin with the idea that a set of obituaries contains valuable information about how societal groups and professions are constructed in the popular mind as janice hume observes obituaries may help to distribute a type of ideology to their mass audiences such that the inclusion or exclusion of personal attributes even virtues of the deceased reflect changing ideas about what american society values about its individual citizens lives  pp  obituaries especially nyt obituaries are a genre unto themselves indeed obituaries in the nyt were the subject of an exhibition entitled obituary mounted at wellesley colleges davis museum and cultural center in  designed by joseph bartscherer obituary consists of rows of low rectangular plexiglas stands each serving as a repository for six issues of the nyt that carried an obituary on the front page starting with issues from  the newspapers are placed flat atop each pedestal inviting the viewer to read the obituary and look at its accompanying photograph as arthur danto points out the exhibit resembles that of a cemetery copies of the nyt are laid out in orderly ranks like headstones and each of the front pages carries the death notice of some notable person the viewer is thus transformed into a visitor who peruses the obituaries with the kind of interest with which we read the epitaphs in a graveyard  p  danto notes how bartscherer was particularly struck by the obituarial photograph and what was said by means of it about what the life to which it belonged meant  p  as well as the often ironic juxtaposition of the obiturial text with other frontpage headlines stories and pictures  bartscherers exhibit also causes the viewer to consider the choices made in selecting whom to memorialize while many newspapers announce the death of all local residents the new york times is highly selective listing about twentyfive local deaths a day and identifying a handful of figures it considers sufficiently notable for a story on the inside obituary page and with extreme stringency for the front page of the paper  p  frontpage obituaries are thus a marker that something very significant about our world is explained and the placement of the obituary above or below the fold has the added effect of creating a hierarchy of the dead based on the roles they assumed in life the standard for inclusion is repute rather than celebrity with repute established by an individuals contribution to change in his or her profession or in society  p  in other words they collectively reflect that profession or more precisely how readers perceive and are informed about that profession which brings us back to davies placzek abramowicz and reed what portrait of librarianship emerges from their obituaries and the obituaries of other librarians   one example of this is the implicit humor in the pairing of a birds eye view of a times square detour with the obituary of astronaut alan shepard  p  purpose the present article performs a content analysis of nyt obituaries for librarians who died between  and  we examine these obituaries to understand how librarianship is portrayed through a textual genre geared to and read avidly by the general public as mark singer observes the appeal of obituaries has something to do with the contemplation of a completed cycle of accomplishment or notoriety concisely wrought  p  we analyze each obituary for information about the working lives of librarians are they public academic school government or research librarians are they described as scholars authorities or something else what are their most frequent contributions and accomplishments are there any common themes there are precedents for using obituaries to examine images of various professions and the way those portrayals reflect broader perceptions of professional groups christa rodler erich kirchler and erik hölzl in an examination of obituary notices in four germanlanguage newspapers of men and women in leadership roles that had been written by the company or organization where the subject had worked categorized all verbs adjectives and nouns according to a classification system of fiftyeight descriptive word categories made a genderbased comparison of the frequency of descriptive word categories and using the opinion of experts in the field of human resource management ranked these categories in terms of leadership styles and success  alan marks and tommy piggee investigated obituaries in the arkansas democrat gazette focusing on the relationship between a subjects race gender and socioeconomic status and the length and diversity of content of the obituary as well as the presence or absence of a photograph  richard kinnier arlene metha lydia buki and patrick rawa examined eleven years of obituaries from the american psychologist to build a demographic profile of psychologists and their general subculture through a ranking of the most frequently occurring value themes  pp  of course as stephen moore recognizes in his analysis of the sociological profile of the typical subject of obituaries in the economist obituary subjects are seen and judged through an ideological lens and then framed through an ideologically determined construction  p  obituaries of librarians in the nyt may thus manifest certain biases such as regionalism american exceptionalism and overrepresentation of professionals serving constituencies in new york boston and washington while this study does look at how the profession of librarianship is constructed in a single publication the purpose is not to deconstruct the ideological lens of the nyt but to get a sense of what the reader of these obituaries learns about the professional life of librarians and how this reflects upon the profession as a whole  pp  the decision to use obituaries exclusively from the nyt stems from its prominence as a major national newspaper and its obituary selection criteria rather than the desire to say something about the newspaper itself nonetheless we take into account marks and piggees observation that there is considerable leeway in the content of what aspects of a persons life will be emphasized  p  those emphasized aspects especially when they are emphasized by a publication not geared to members of the profession itself can reveal much about how the public understands librarianship the present study also tries to come to grips with some of the issues raised by wayne wiegand who urged that much more attention be paid to the connections between power and knowledge that are prevalent in libraries and librarianship  p  and the work of douglas raber who suggested that librarians are in gramscian terms organic intellectuals defined as organizers of capitalist hegemony and its culture who play central strategic and ideological roles in the superstructure that reproduces capitalist relations of production  p  more specifically it falls within the tradition of studies that examine representations of librarians in adult fiction eg   childrens fiction  films eg   comic books  or media in general eg  for example gary radford and marie radford using the insights of michel foucault about the structures of discourse show that the librarian is often depicted in popular fiction as a formidable gatekeeper between order and chaos who guarding against any disruption against the sacred order of texts in a cathedrallike setting by frequently subjecting patrons to humiliation and surveillance is embedded within a language and vocabulary of fear  p  in a subsequent article marie radford and gary radford use a cultural studies approach to explain the media stereotype of the female librarian in the film party girl suggesting that mary the protagonist of the movie is portrayed as being so obsessed with order that she has now metamorphosed into an other set apart from the normal person  p an other who instills fear and dependence in users by punctilious rigorous attention to shelving protocols and the creation of classification systems that befuddle ordinary individuals as befits a distinct media genre obituaries have different codes and conventions than fiction or films by closely examining obituaries we can determine whether the type of repute enjoyed by librarians in fiction and filmsthe stereotypical picture of a shy sheltered dowdy dour librarian obsessed with order and silenceis perpetuated in another type of text procedures a search was conducted for nyt obituaries on lexisnexis using the search string librarian and died and obituar and the date parameters january   to december   the search retrieved  documents after eliminating incidental librarians eg  p b paid notices and false hits a total of  obituaries meeting the following two criteria were retained the obituary subject was by training or profession a librarian and had spent the majority of his or her professional life working in a library archives or in a field directly associated with librarianship these  obituaries chronicle the lives of seventyeight men  percent and fortyfive women  percent content analysis was performed to identify common facts and workrelated themes facts include the type of library where the subjects were employed and whether these individuals had held leadership positions taught

had made the greatest impact or contribution themes address the substance and the nature of the work librarians performed and their professional contributions personal anecdotes can also reveal much about a person but because only thirteen obituaries  percent contained such anecdotes we do not discuss them here   the obituary for alfred lane is an example of how our classificatory decisions were made although lane was a librarian at columbia university for forty years his obituary concentrates on his efforts to create a library at the writers room in new york described as a haven for novelists historians cookbook writers and anyone else able to prove seriousness about writing  p a it makes only two brief references to his tenure at columbia with one of these references stating that he used his contacts at columbia to acquire books for the writers room accordingly the type of library recorded for lanes obituary was special not academic results facts as table  shows fifty

a designated institution fortytwo librarians contributed in some way to their institutions especially in the realm of collection development some obituaries especially those of rarebooks librarians provide a veritable laundry list of books and manuscripts that entered a collection under the guidance of the obituary subject over a span of thirtyfive years herbert cahoon added to the morgan library collections a draft in pencil of the little prince as well as drawings by antoine de saintexupery  travels with charley donated by its author john steinbeck in  and a missing volume of the journals of thoreau found in  completing a set that j pierpont morgan had bought in   p c there was also the mary flagler cary music collection which mr cahoon said had been hidden away in mrs carys fifth avenue apartment for years and included copies of brahmss first symphony and beethovens ghost trio  p c the listing of acquired books and manuscripts complements rather than overshadows the contribution of the librarian in charge of the collection the acquisitions process is transformed into a detective narrative with the librarian as sleuth or strategist ingeniously masterminding the hunt for materials thus revealing as much about the background interests and personalities of the obituary subjects as about the collections that resulted from their strategies kenneth lohf rarebooks librarian at columbia university searched bookstores and for very little money  was able to get first editions of brighton rock england made me and the ministry of fear  p a later he persuaded columbia graduates who had entered the publishing business to donate books and other materials to the library in this way bennett cerf the founder of random house gave columbia all his files including

whatever lola wants lola gets  p  the recounting of librarians methodologies and triumphs in collection building links their contributions to the importance rarity or in some cases the sheer number of the works acquired just as the prominence of a collection raises the status of the library it also confers acclaim on the individual who helped build itan idea supported by the number of times that collection development defines a librarians contribution to an institution consider the following statement about philip miller former director of the new york public librarys music division he was instrumental in building its collections into one of the worlds finest and largest repositories of recordings and music lore second in this country only to that of the library of congress  p b this description stresses not only the quality of the collection but also quantity indeed when the obituary subject worked at a more generalized libraryas director of an academic library system for examplethe summary of collection development activities more readily calls to mind stocktrading volumes than it does the type of descriptive bibliography found in the obituaries of rarebooks or special collections librarians collections doubled at fordham university under the direction of anne murphy  p b while margaret plumb increased the book collection at hunter college from  volumes to  during the  years she was there  p b obituaries also mention that librarians contributed to their institutions by leading them in new directions in some cases this type of contribution is again rooted in collection development rather then adding specific works to established collection areas however the librarian increased the scope of the collection by introducing new areas during his fiveyear tenure at the library of congress archibald macleish began a permanent film collection and instituted a slavic collection  p a obituaries also refer to librarians implementing plans or systems that increased user access to collections with the tools enlisted to deliver this access reflecting the era in which the librarian worked as director from  to  emerson greenaway introduced bookmobiles to the philadelphia public library system  p d while newyork historical society director james heslin in  revamped cataloguing procedures to make the societys collection more accessible to the public  p a as the heslin example suggests the majority of the librarians whose obituaries are examined here implemented changes during the s through the s when technologically driven systems were still experimental to put the scope of these changes in perspective the obituary for chester lewis named the chief librarian of the new york times in  mentions that he introduced microfilming to replace the large bound volumes of back issues of the times and later became a director of the microfilming corporation of america  p b twentyfive years later douglas bryant director of harvard universitys library system from  to  helped  create a computerbased catalogue of works to be made freely available to scholars it later became the research libraries group a national consortium  p  analyzed chronologically the obituaries recount the introduction and exploration of new technologies thus linking the obituary subjects own experiences to what are now established practices of course implementing changes technological or otherwise necessitates money the obituaries of four librarians who worked in public library systems highlight their fiscal management in the face of adversity kenneth duchac director of the brooklyn public library for sixteen years led the library through the difficult days of the citys fiscal crisis in the mids despite severe budget cutbacks he was credited with keeping every branch library in brooklyn open  p  as head of the schomburg center hutson fought for financing and lobbied the state legislature for money through numerous trips to the state capitol at albany where she spoke to many members who had never seen a black woman up in front of them at the legislature  p b librarians are also remembered for creating new libraries alfred lane was instrumental in building the writers room library in manhattan volunteering to be its first librarian at a time when it owned only one book a dogeared dictionary  p a at his retirement in  he

behind the creation of the chancellor robert r livingson masonic library one of the largest masonic libraries in the world  p  expertisescholarship twentynine obituaries mention expertise or scholarship here the focus shifts from the role of librarians in developing a renowned and valuable collection to the portrayal of the librarians themselves as renowned and valued resources based on their knowledge of various subject areas at the same time the idea of making a contribution broadens from a specific institution to the wider realm of scholarship or general inquiry a librarians expertise in a given subject area is conveyed through descriptions that appear in the headline or text of the obituaryspecialist authority scholarand by praise from the librarians peers and colleagues for example donald gallup former curator of the yale collection of american literature is extolled as being the premier bibliographer for both t s eliot and ezra pound specializing in finding the first appearances of their work and documenting their creativity  p  librarians displayed their expertise in a wide variety of subjects ranging from architecture photography and maine genealogy to medicine americana and the gutenberg bible the breadth and specificity of this knowledge also varies while jack dalton is identified simply as an authority in library studies  p  maurice tauber also cited as a library authority is described more specifically as one of americas authorities on cataloguing classification and technical processes  p b both were part of columbia universitys school of library services where dalton served as dean from  to  and tauber was the melvil dewey professor of library service from  to  sometimes the expertise of librarians did not coincide with the focus of the institutions where they worked in these cases authority stems from selfmotivation as opposed to the more typical circumstances of formal education specific professional training and employment

modern arts dance archives and an editor of the publication dance index despite his professional affiliation with the world of dance he was an authority on italian renaissance bronzes which formed

p a with no more than her interest and a librarians salary davies also became a knowledgeable and an important collector of daviss prints drawings and gothicstyle furniture so much so that some of the pieces are now at the metropolitan museum of art  p a expertise is also frequently correlated with a large body of scholarship with obituaries discussing both the librarians productivity and the status it confersthe idea underlying the citation in daviess obituary that she is the person who published the most articles on a j davis  p a the same holds true for maurice tauber the cataloguing classification and technical processes expert whose prolific writingshis bibliography published in  lists more than  works by or about himwere instrumental in establishing his reputation as one of americas authorities on these subjects  p b other types of publication that bestow expertise are scholarly works within specific subject areas that became seminal or standard texts and catalogs or

early advocate of medical librarian traininga position that he not only promoted but also embodied in his own career path at columbia university  p b named head librarian at the medical school in  he was successively a library science professor in  chief of biological sciences libraries in  and a medical school professor in  before retiring in   p b hogan was a key figure in guiding the countrys libraries into the electronic age specifically through her role as a national leader in getting libraries to function as information retrieval systems and as an innovator of bibliographic instruction programs about the internet  p a as the career of zena sutherland illustrates the nature of librarianship can also be changed by individuals who did not primarily work in a library but nevertheless were librarians by training in the process of reviewing about  titles as editor of the bulletin of the center for childrens books from  to  she not only became a stalwart supporter of books that addressed a range of problems and issues that some still find shocking but also developed a critical rather than sugary descriptive approach to reviewing because she accepted children as real and aware individuals and their books as real literature  p b among the reviews that the obituary cites are two works by maurice sendak in  the psychologically incisive picture book where the wild things are  was controversial in the way it depicted a childs temper tantrum mrs sutherland found it most imaginative and unusual her  review of mr sendaks in the night kitchen serenely sailed past little mickeys brief nudity which so disturbed other reviewers and described the book as an engaging fantasy  p b sutherland similarly gave a favorable and balanced review to ill get there it better be worth the trip by john donovan a  novel for young adults that introduced homosexuality as a theme  p b three individuals raised the publics consciousness about issues outside the typically defined realm of librarianship in addition to her duties as a yale law professor and librarian vincentdaviss was a deputy director of the orville h schell jr center for international human rights which promotes research and assists lawyers and organizations concerned about preserving individual rights and freedoms and acts as a clearing house for information  p d macleish used poetry to express his views on a variety of contemporary sociopolitical issues including his stance against the mccarthyism of the s against military involvement in southeast asia against the anticommunist concepts of the cold war and against the americanization of the world  p a many of librarian dee browns twentynine books including bury my heart at wounded knee drew attention to the wrongful portrayal of native americans in us history and acted as a counterbalance to eurocentric and hollywood interpretations of the conquest of the american west  p a as his obituary notes the racism and wanton carelessness of whites and the betrayals and killings they perpetrated were relentless themes for mr brownthemes that had not entered the public consciousness  p a helpfulness whether by building a library collection overseeing an institutions expansion sharing expertise through published work or drawing attention to important issues librarians acted in ways that provided assistance to library users in the abstract and to scholarship or society as a whole but only six obituaries describe librarians helping individual patrons and colleagues through direct interaction including an uncanny ability for reference work for instance alfred lane specialized in answering writers obscure questions from how to correspond with federal prisoners to who paid for alice liddell the alice of alice in wonderland to come from london to columbia university to accept an honorary degree  p a lane himself is quoted as saying i bamboozled some people into thinking that i knew everything under the sun  p a adolf placzek a distinguished historian editor and preservationist who served as director of the avery architectural library for twenty years and edited architectural history treatises is described as a resource par excellence for preservationists and architects  he inevitably knew the answer to their questions and inevitably had something illuminating to add  p c dina abramowicz head librarian at the yivo institute for jewish research who had a mind that was a mental card catalog and was flintlike in her insistence upon historical and linguistic accuracy is remembered for unearthing obscure materials for scholars like irving howe and novelists like leon uris as well as for thousands of ordinary people trying to research their family histories  p  because of her firsthand and encyclopaedic knowledge of the lost yiddish world of eastern europe she identified hidden resources for historians like george kennan when kennan was looking for material on a th century convert to christianity she led him not only to the entry in the librarys precious russianjewish encyclopedia but also to a scarce book in yiddish about jewish apostates  p b she also gamely fielded inquiries from journalists and writers who liked to season their prose with a word or two of yiddish and who relied on her as their authority for the transliterated spelling of words like bobe grandmother and yichus pedigree  p  patrons also relied on elizabeth cornelia hall described as an indispensable reference work in her capacity both as director of the new york botanical garden library and as the person answering the phone at the gardens plantinformation service  p a like abramowicz hall not only helped scholars and writersamericas leading garden writers and horticulturalistsbut also the average greenthumbed or allthumbs gardener dispensing advice on dubious mushrooms and sympathy to people with terminal plants  p a this advice was often remembered for its quirkiness once when a caller asked how she might kill a tree without her husbands knowledge miss hall replied well you could kill your husband first  p a not all of the librarians helpfulness derived solely from knowing the right answers helen adams masten a childrens librarian who read to children at the new york public library from  to  received hundreds of grateful letters from city children and adults on her retirement  p b the role of charlotte green who was the most indispensable nonlawyer for sixty years as librarian and claims negotiator at a new york law firm is described by a coworker as follows she had to keep track of all the books all the new laws that came out she had to know authors tax laws and so on she catalogued everything we adored her she was a very kind person we had a lot of office boys and girls and she taught them a great dealabout the firm and about life courtesy manners thats the way charlotte was  p b and one of the lawyers in the firm recalls the following anecdote mr leaman whose father had been head of the law firms real estate department recalled meeting miss green on a trip to the office as a boy in the s she gave him paper clips to play with and he remembered her when he became a lawyer at the firm in  even then he said she was the nerve center of the office  p b accordingly helpfulness derives as much from personal interactions with colleagues and patrons as it does from professional acumen in other words it is not simply knowing the answers or doing a job well that defines helpfulness in this context but also something more essentially linked to the librarian as a unique individualsomething that makes that person who he or she is   this comparison to an iconic if semiextinct tool of the trade is emphasized by the obituarial photograph which shows abramowicz dainty in an old world way  p  sandwiched between a bank of card catalog drawers in the background and piles of books and prominently labeled microform boxes in the foreground an overall portrait of librarianship what then constitutes the obituary pantheon of librarians in the new york times most obviously librarianship is construed as a male profession with  percent of memorialized librarians being men one explanation for this may be patriarchy many of the librarians had careers between  and  a period when men enjoyed privileged professional status still this runs counter to the gender balance among librarians in the united states where women were  percent of all librarians  p   percent of academic librarians   percent of academic library directors  and  percent of public library directors  just as clearly librarianship is forcefully associated with the academic world in nyt obituaries with  percent of obituary subjects working at academic libraries while only  and  percent worked in public and school libraries respectively the reality is quite different academic librarians are only  percent of all librarians in the united states while public and school librarians are  and  percent of the total number respectively  more important the five themes identified in table  reveal a great deal about the scale of changes that librarians have effected at the conceptual level change can come either quickly or incrementally and can be large or small these sets of distinctions are independent of the scale of the impact of the change smallscale change can ultimately have an enormous impact on a group of individuals or even society in general just as largescale changes can have little or no impact on its target groups while nyt obituaries imply that the changes made possible by librarians have had a large impact on one or more groups of individuals the nature and scope of the changes themselves are varied consider the discrepancies between the changes implemented by bryant director of harvard universitys library system from  to   sutherland editor of the bulletin of the center for childrens books from  to   and matsen  bryant implemented a shared electronic catalog that evolved into the research libraries groupa change that can be characterized both at inception and completion as largescale the innovations of sutherland and matsena different approach to reviewing childrens literature  p b and the decision to begin reading to children at the nypl  p b respectivelyalso had enormous positive consequences but they began with two individuals acting alone in a smallscale way taking it upon themselves to alter their own individual approach to professional practice while all the changes had largescale impact most of the librarians portrayed in the nyt obituary pages initiated changes that from the outset were more on the scale of the actions taken by bryant than those of sutherland and masten while this is not particularly surprising in terms of themes such as international outreach and consciousnessraising the focus on the largescaleakin to the more amorphous concept of greatnesscan also be detected in other themes obituaries citing a librarians expertise or scholarship often define these qualities in terms of the volume of the individuals published output as well the size of the collections that librarians helped develop is linked in the obituaries to the size or importance of the librarians contribution in other cases the librarians role in collection development is tied to the prestige of particular acquisitions rather than the size of the collection yet here too there is a connection with sizespecifically to the extent of the librarians contacts while collection development in the realm of rarebooks and similarly specialized libraries is often presented in terms of sleuthing and discovery the collecting ingenuity ascribed to some librarians is predicated on networking karpel director of the museum of modern art from  to  used many innovative means to increase the librarys collection such as borrowing rare manuscripts including futurist manifestos dada pamphlets and avantgarde art magazines and recording them on microfilm  p a but he also built up the book collection by making use of an extensive range of personal contacts that he maintained not only with books collectors and dealers around the world but also with artists involved in these movements  p a other examples of networking are common philip miller cited for numerous contributions to the music division of the nypl was ubiquitous as a commentator arranger or presenter at library concerts music exhibitions and countless events with rare recordings or opera stars  p b another music librarian and producer lawrence jay taylor was music librarian for liza minnelli chita rivera roberta peters and other artists  p b far from creating a stereotypical portrait of librarians as shy sheltered dour or dowdy individuals the emphasis on largescale matters in nyt obituaries produces an image of librarianship as a glamorous profession like karpel miller and taylor many of the librarians had connections to prominent people and they made the most of these social networks like lane lohf and szladits they are situated within the discourse of sleuthing and discovery librarians were also players on a global stage founding libraries abroad bringing many salient issues to the attention of the world community and developing international guidelines that led to institutional progress in sum the librarians memorialized by the nyt thought big instigating changes that would outlast their own tenure at a particular institutionmost likely an academic oneand in many cases connecting institutions through technological advances they also wrote big producing hundreds of scholarly articles or seminal books in various academic fields at the same time the opportunity to work on a large scale and assume a glamorous professional role can be connected for example to the fact that  percent of obituary subjects held leadership roles table  after all it is easier to instigate largescale changes when assuming a large role in the daytoday management of an institution similarly the type of library where they worked affects the type of changes librarians can institute as table  shows a large proportion of memorialized librarians worked in academic or special libraries or library departments focused on the arts or on rare books and manuscripts just as the opportunity to institute largescale changes increases in leadership positions working in a rarebooks or art library increases the opportunity to do the type of sleuthingtracking down a prized document for example or unearthing an undiscovered manuscriptthat both creates an aura of intrigue around the librarian and allows him or her to make use of important contacts a comparatively low percentage of obituary subjects was employed at public libraries where such opportunities might be less plentiful yet even within the category of public libraries many obituary subjects were affiliated with prominent departments and collections such as the schomburg and the berg and as in the case of miller directed largescale projects that resulted in a high profile for both library and librarian the emphasis on largescale projects carried out by intrepid wellconnected and globetrotting uppermanagement individuals a majority of whom were male brings us back to the question of librarian stereotypes as radford and radford have shown negative stereotypes of librariansamong which are matronly appearance dowdy dress fussiness obsession with order and predominant activities such as shelving stamping and shushing  p are typically associated with female librarians yet to judge from the nyt obituaries librarianship is a glamorous profession that offers individuals a fulfilling exciting worldly and eventful career why is there a disjunction between these two images of librarianshipa relatively negative image that is perpetuated by reference to female practitioners and a relatively positive image that is typically associated with male mostly academic practitioners on one level it could be a question of gender as daria carle and susan anthes demonstrated the visual images on the covers and within the textual matter of major library journals such as american libraries and library journal do not reflect the gender ratio of the profession overrepresenting men and underrepresenting women  in a recent ala report evidence was presented that though most library directors are women the percentage of directors who are men exceeds the percentage of librarians who are men and the annual average salaries of male directors public and academic libraries combined exceed the salaries of female directors by almost   librarianship as a profession has a long tradition of being ambivalent about and valuing justly the contributions of women the question of negative and positive stereotypes may be viewed as part of this dynamic but this identified disjunction could also be linked with what wiegand has called the nexus between power and knowledge  p  as discussed above the types of libraries where the memorialized librarians worked and the types of subjects they concerned themselves with could in general be characterized as belonging to the world of serious academic scholarship wiegand notes in a survey of the history of american librarianship that services designed to improve access to the information desired by scientists and academics were more valued than services designed to improve access to the information contained in reading materials desired by housewives and childrena situation that had something to do with the fact that such patrons had more political social and economic clout than a black child or a female romance novel reader  pp  wiegand here was writing specifically about the period  but his insights transfer readily into the world of librarianship portrayed in nyt obituaries for the most part the world of these librarians is big librarianship catering to the needs of scholars and scientists engaged in serious research librarians are presented as valued and influential contributors to the progress and realization of scholarly research they make important discoveries themselves circulate within a wide network of friends and colleagues contribute to the influence and prestige of large research libraries and large causes in the united states and are instrumental in the growth of libraries internationally and it is worth noting many women participate in this world of big librarianship and are portrayed in a positive light in one sense librariansboth male and femalewho thought wrote and acted big may be seen as organic intellectuals defined by raber as people who offer a potentially progressive and transforming service but  in a context that preserves their selfinterest and liberal identity within the capitalist hegemony  p  in other words they represent a dominant professional imperative that systematically privileged some library purposes and audiences to the exclusion of others  p  it is therefore not that surprising that they are portrayed in a positive light and that librarianship appears as an exciting profession while the argument could be made that the rhetorical construction of librarianship as a glamorous profession is a welcome change from popular negative stereotypes at least one problematic issue arises in connection with this positive portrayal there are relatively few obituaries that portray librarians who like masten and green were not directors of prominent libraries or published authors or experts in special fields yet were conscientious librarians who went about their jobs and are remembered for the ways in which they helped ordinary people especially children on a daily basis from an ideological perspective these librarians form part of what raber identifies as the transgressorsindividuals who are immersed in the dominant culture and depend on that culture for their social position  p  but who at the same time do not fit within the parameters of big librarianship there are of course numerous librarians of whom it could be said that they contributed to small librarianshipthat is they recommended the perfect novel or poetry book quietly helped find just the right piece of information thoughtfully inquired about a senior citizens health bandaged a childs bruised knee after storytime or cared for the plants on library windowsills that provided a welcome and necessary beauty for lonely depressed or homeless individuals but if this type of librarian is remembered at all it is typically through a negative gendered portrait that emphasizes obsession with order dowdiness and such stereotypical acts as shelving stamping and shushing  p  there seems to be very little middle space or will to define librarianship in a positive way as an amalgam of small and caring acts that summed together positively affect the lives of ordinary and marginalized individuals while perhaps not as glamorous as the lives led and the contributions made by their counterparts in big libraries there is a history in every life  p b without the histories of librarians whose idea of big did not match the reigning paradigms of big there is a danger of forgetting that smallscale acts can lead to great changes and that these smallscale acts of helpfulness and care can have as great an impact as largescale plans and actions there is also the danger of having a bifurcated view of librarianship positives images of maledominated big librarianshipwhat roma harris  p  labels the expert modeland negative images of femaleintensive small librarianshipwhat harris calls the service model whose guiding principle is helpfulness  p  one consequence of this is that in an attempt to enhance the overall image of the profession undue emphasis has been placed on moving librarianship in directions that lead to positive assessments and imagesfor example what wiegand terms library expertise and big library institutions  p  as well as a focus on managerial prowess and everfaster everbigger information technology systemsand a concomitant neglect of those aspects of librarianship that focus on small daily acts that assume extraordinary meaning in the lives of countless patrons as librarianship has moved toward the male model of professionalism  p big librarianshipin an attempt to overcome a lack of esteem  p  and as it eviscerates the idea of library from definitions of what it is that its practitioners do it also downplays essential aspects of its service and carebased ethic from one perspective it is as if librarians decided that the traditional service and carebased ethicinstead of systemic devaluation of womans workwas the central reason for the persistence of negative librarian stereotypes thus the logic went if they moved away from this ethic they would also shed negative stereotypes and fashion for themselves a new vibrant and sexy imagean image somehow connected with male models of authoritative professionalism and encapsulated in the notion of the information science professional indeed that is one reason why the debate in  about the nancy pearl shushing librarian action figure was so virulent some saw it as a way to emphasize the values of small librarianship especially the joys of recommending good books to patrons others saw it as setting the profession back  years   yet as katherine adams suggests embracing negative stereotypes of librarians can be liberating since it allows librarians to understand what is at stake in the stereotype as well as to appreciate mechanisms for subverting the stereotype to their own ends  p  in many ways then the collective portrait of librarians in nyt obituaries at the end of the twentieth century mirrors the fractures and fissures bedeviling librarianship as it enters the twentyfirst century on the one hand the obituaries show a glamorous and exciting side of big librarianship on the other they minimize the importance of helpfulnesssmall librarianshipas an integral aspect of librarybased work   the exact figures for the number of librarians in the united states in academic libraries is  in public libraries  in school libraries  and in
