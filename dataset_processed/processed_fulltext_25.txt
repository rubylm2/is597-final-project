the danger of an untold story excerpts from my life as a black academic  however the personal consequencesto my mind heart and spiritfor continuing to remain silent have become burdens that are too great to bear rearview mirror early experiences in academia not long ago i found an essay that i wrote for an elective course in which i was enrolled during my doctoral program the course focused on the history of women in higher education with particular emphasis on the experiences many of them harrowing that ultimately paved the way for women to thrive in modern higher education spaces in the united states in addition to the courses required textbooks and scholarly articles the professor also chose margaret atwoods dystopian novel the handmaids tale as required reading that all students in the class had to incorporate into an essay that addressed a unique perspective regarding womens issues i began my paper by musing about whether i was transparent actually invisiblebecause of the many times that i was ignored in situations where my presence and contributions should have been acknowledged i went on to detail what i now know to be instances of microaggressionseveryday slights insults indignities and invalidations delivered toward people of color sue  p  that left me concerned that i was the cause of or imagining my own mistreatment i thought perhaps i was simply paranoid    was it possible that the seemingly disparaging comments of you certainly are articulate after i delivered a speech were sincere    could the memo and subsequent electronic mail i generated detailing a plan for the class in which i was assisting really have been misplaced    by all three of the faculty members i gave it to franklin  p  as i re read my essay i was saddened to realize that the confusing and sometimes demeaning situations i described in a paper written in  are still commonplace over a decade later at institutions across the united states and internationally see for example gabriel  tate  howard baptiste  harris  kelly  winkle wagner  more significantly i was unsettled and disgusted by the memories of even worse situations that have happened to me in professional settings in the years since i wrote the essay even though the research i conducted for my paper indicated that even once an african american woman has proven that she has the intellect required to successfully navigate a d octoral p rogram gender and ethnicity issues may prevent her from having an enjoyable experience as faculty in a predominately white institution  franklin  pp  i was hopeful that my experience would u ltimately be different i was wrong
 hill pardon me inappropriate interactions after earning my phd but prior to accepting my first academic position i began to reluctantly realize that even though i was no longer a student not much was going to change in the way in which i was treated during a conversation with a tenured professor during which i expressed my anxiety about interviewing for assistant professor positions he assured me that i had no reason to worry because i was young attractive and a minority never mind my intellectual abilities sound research skills and years of preparation weeks after that exchange during marathon interviewing sessions at a professional conference the dean of one prestigious ischool requested a meeting with me i was flattered i had not signed up to interview with this particular school because i did not see an immediate fit between its courses and overall focus and my skill set how was it possible that i had come to the deans attention had i done so well at other interviews that word was spreading and i was now a sought after candidate when the one on one meeting began my unspoken questions were answered almost immediately after sharing the obligatory description of the school the dean said i dont exactly know what we would do with you but we need faculty of color so well come up with something even now over a decade after this particular incident i still cringe in humiliation it has long been reported by members of marginalized groups who work in higher education and other professional settings that they experience tokenism and are assumed to have been hired to fulfill a quota souto manning  ray  actually being encouraged to view and offer myself up as a token was an unexpected and shocking experience the mentor mystery hoping for help researchers in numerous fields have described the impact of strong mentoring on faculty success in general some examples include bean lucas  hyers  kohn  and smith martinez lanigan wellsmoses  koehler  researchers have also noted the need for faculty from underrepresented groups to have effective mentoring specifically m entoring as a form of support is believed to be essential to the career advancement and success of african american faculty wilson  p  during my time as a junior faculty member i longed for mentorship having not been officially paired with a mentor as was the norm i was told id somehow slipped through the cracks one senior faculty membera white femalevolunteered for the role because we had similar research interests and she was well known and respected in lis i gratefully accepted her offer it wasnt long before i realized that this arrangement was not beneficial for me while i expected my mentor to act as a guide into my new career what i experienced caused me to feel as though i had returned to graduate school i was told what i should do as opposed to asked what my interests were i was assigned various
the danger of an untold story excerpts from my life as a black academic  tasks instead of engaged in a conversation about what my strengths were my self appointed mentor could never seem to find time to read and share feedback on my draft manuscripts but did not hesitate to request that i act as copy editor for her writing though i knew this was not a healthy relationship for me i was at a loss for what to do i had not had a formal conversation with my mentor about either of our needs wants or expectations from our relationship so i decided that the fault was mostly mine because i was young both chronologically and in my career i lacked the courage and the savvy to attempt to reset the relationship by initiating a conversation to discuss what was not working what i believed i needed in a mentor and what she saw as her role and her limitations instead i began to avoid all but professionally necessary interactions with her years later a second self appointed mentor this time a white male at least took the time to have essential expectations setting conversations with me in fact we met regularly to talk about my professional goals and the progress i was making on my research he seemed so sincere about helping me find my footing in academia that i felt comfortable letting my guard down and sharing some of the insecurities and doubts i had about my ability to succeed in a tenure track position i later learned that hed shared what i had believed to be confidential conversations with at least one member of our administration additionally after a meeting about a letter generated from my annual review that we interpreted very differently he spoke to me so harshly that i retreated to my office in tears yet again i did not have the courage to confront this mentor or to formally end the relationship i did however stop arranging mentoring sessions while niemann  p  cautions that faculty of color should not assume that every negative experience or action toward you is grounded in racial    bias wilson  p  explains that the double marginalization that african american women face can make it difficult to determine whether the reactions and behaviors directed at them are due to race gender or a combination of both i have existed in that liminal space of uncertainty on the one hand i am not certain that the mentoring mishaps occurred because i am faculty of color on the other hand i am clear that they happened to me and i am faculty of color i also know that my white colleagues who received mentorship from the same individuals did not report similar instances of dismissal condescension and overall mistreatment i never again sought formal mentoring but did reach out for advice on an as needed basis from people with whom i felt a connection that i met in other parts of the university at professional conferences and during my visits to other university campuses the members of this network of mentors wilson  p  are not all people of color nor are they all women but they all have my eternal gratitude as i am certain that i would not have persevered without their encouragement and guidance
 hill i am not my hair impoliteness and insults very fewif anyrefereed lis journal articles make mention of hair and yet here we are scholars and popular writers alike have presented accounts of african american people in general and black women specifically being viewed and treated as though they were exotic pets or objects of wonder brown  robinson  their writing describes instances of women who were subjected to being touched without warning or permission i have been on the receiving end of such treatment in public spaces many were the times that peopleusually white women and small children the latter of whom i readily forgivehad grabbed handfuls of my braided locks or patted my curly natural hair i was not however prepared to have similar things happen at an academic institution at which i was employed i was certain that my colleagues were too enlightened too refined to be so invasive to my person and to my personal space most behaved professionally and respectfully but some could not resist their curiosity i recall one particular incident when just prior to the beginning of a meeting a colleague who was a tenured full professor simultaneously complimented and reached toward my hair i could not recoil quickly enough to avoid her making contact she pulled her hand away with it covered in hair oil neither of us quite knew what to do next and so we sat in silence with me feeling somewhat embarrassed and quite violated and her feeling too awkward to leave the room to wash her hand in no situation is it acceptable for any part of a persons body to be touched without permission it is particularly inexcusable in a setting where there is the obvious and necessary expectation of professional distance another more unsettling incident involving my hair occurred when a colleague another tenured full professor allowed her emotional support animal to freely roam the halls of our building when i encountered the doga large breed with tightly curled black furi froze and loudly and quite frantically called out for help when the animals owner finally appeared to corral it i thanked her and hurried away as i made my way down the hall she called after me to offer id think youd like him    you have the same hair though i was speechless at the moment of that ill worded parting comment i later had a conversation with the colleague where she acknowledged her inappropriate words and engaged in a conversation about why what shed said was offensive conclusion and miles to go before i sleep reflecting on some of the negative racially related experiences i have endured during my academic career has been both painful and cathartic as is often the case with traumatic memories the ones i have shared caused me to remember others i have been patted on the head as a colleague walked past me at a faculty meeting i have been asked
the danger of an untold story excerpts from my life as a black academic  to explain the behaviors of black students even though i had never met them i have been bluntly told that the reason i was assigned to committee membership for something completely outside my expertise interest and ability was weve gotta have a black person because i choose to search for the good in all situations i can confidently say thatthough i would not willingly relive the emotionally and psychologically traumatic instances i have describedi will always strive to use them to my benefit and the benefit of others i am after all the sum of my experiences i would not be able to show compassion for other marginalized and mistreated people had i not been subjected to exclusion i might never have realized my passion for teaching had i not encountered professors whose dismissive behaviors toward me provided motivation for doing things differently in fact i am proud to have earned two teaching excellence awards as they serve as reminders that i do make a difference in my students lives perhaps i would not be a fervent advocate and ally for higher education students staff and faculty whether or not they share my cultural background had i not personally experienced the alienating effects of having an ineffective mentor i certainly would not be the unabashedly loving fiercely supportive friend spouse and mother that i take pride in being had i not encountered situations that left me feeling confounded devastated and utterly abandoned brilliant scholar nicole cooke  describes a conversation she had with herself that helped her to fight through the fatigue and burnout that often accompany being a faculty member of color at a predominantly white institution cooke came full circle from questioning whether she wanted a seat at the table to pondering whether she should relinquish that seat to deciding that she not only deserved to be at the table but that it was vital that she stay there pp  i admit that i am constantly in the process of having a similar conversation with myself as i continue to forge a path as a scholar and teacher of color in higher education at times the desire to push away from the table and maybe even knock it over is overwhelming at other times my drive to help make room at the table for other deserving faculty of color keeps me firmly planted in my seat i end this narrative with the quotation from civil rights activist pauli murrays testimony before congress in  that i used to begin the essay i wrote in  if anyone should ask a negro woman in america what has been her greatest achievement her answer would be i survived testimony before congress     i now believe in my academic abilities i no longer blame myself when i am mistreated i speak up for myself and for others i do not allow other peoples opinions of me to cause me to question my worth by continuing to move forward i have not merely survivedi have found a way to thrive
