it has long been recognized that board books play an important role in the cognitive development of infants and toddlers  interactions with board books help infants learn to recognize familiar objects and to develop basic concepts related to people animals possessions familiar events and daily routines through naming and pointing board books help build a toddlers vocabulary and aid in understanding language rhymes rhythms physical actions like hand clapping and the exploration of textures build a toddlers sensory awareness young children who are regularly read to exhibit early literate behavior  but can board books do more it seems likely that exposure to board books about people who look like them and stories that reflect their world may contribute to an infant and toddler of colors developing appreciation of self research shows that infants as young as four weeks old enjoy looking at human faces in picture books  as early as six months infants begin to notice skin differences  by the age of two children begin to ask questions about differences in skin color  and by the age of three children notice physical differences such as hair texture and the shape of facial features which leads them to categorize people and to begin to form attitudes about people of different races and ethnic groups  exposure to multicultural childrens literature has been shown to bolster the selfesteem and cultural identity of children of color   according to beverly tatum  by providing children of color with positive cultural images and messages about their race parents and caregivers not only encourage positive racial identity development but also mitigate the impact of stereotypes in  however kathleen horning observed that board books that feature people of color are a rarity in the nearly allwhite world of board books  p  jonella mongo  confirmed hornings observation finding that only fortyeight board books featuring african americans were published from  through  with the bulk of these being published between  and  by  she could find only one title this study asks is this still the case to answer this question we conducted a content analysis of board books published in the last five years  to determine the representation of people of color this article discusses the issues underlying the research and presents the methodology and results of our analysis a note about term selection racial and ethnic term selection is problematic as james banks  notes many of the terms used do not accurately or sensitively describe the ethnic racial and cultural realities of the united states today since we based our background demographic data on the most recent available united states census bureau data we opted to use their terminology for individual ethnic and racial groups for this reason we use the term hispanic instead of latino or another term and american indian instead of native american or another term educators social scientists and other researchers often refer to groups such as african americans hispanics asian americans and american indians as people of color rather than ethnic minorities  although this term too is disputed by some we chose to use this terminology rather than ethnic minority to refer to persons of nonhispanic european descent who do not belong to any of the other groups identified in the census bureau data we use the census bureaus term white americas youngest children the kids count census data online compiled by the annie e casey foundation captures the ethnic diversity of todays young children  analysis of the  us census data shows that of the more than  million children in the united states who are five years old and under  percent are children of color almost  percent of those children are multiracial the diversity of children in the united states is predicted to grow over the next two decades census figures show that the number of hispanic and asian children younger than age five has grown by doubledigit percentages since  the number of african american children has also grown although more slowly  in  there were  million children in immigrant families residing in the united states  these included both children who were born outside the united states and children born in the united states to at least one foreignborn parent it is predicted that by   million children in the united states will be descendants of immigrants who arrived after   board books board books are especially designed for infants and toddlers constructed of heavy cardboard stock and covered with a washable glossy surface so that they can withstand teeth sticky fingers and being thrown they help babies begin to understand the idea of books  p  true board booksthose created with the interests and needs of the youngest in mindare frequently identification books naming books or books with simple narrative lines   they focus on familiar objects like a shoe or fire truck common animals such as dogs or cats and everyday routines such as eating playing or sleeping often they feature peopleother infants and toddlers mothers fathers grandparents and siblings the illustrations are simple uncluttered and easily identifiable the text too is simple from single words to brief rhyming text the best board books match the short attention span and high energy level of infants and toddlers   board books are among the first books that children are encouraged to read when parents caregivers day care providers and preschool teachers read to infants and toddlers they engage in a giveandtake exchange in which children are encouraged to identify the objects people and actions depicted talk about the emotions being expressed and notice similarities and differences between themselves and the people depicted in the book multiple readings of a book allow for a variety of interactions the durable format of a board book also makes it possible for children to interact with board books alone over time children learn to recognize their own books to turn the pages and to make connections between one book and another  they often develop their favorites asking parents and caregivers to read them over and over development of selfconcept and selfesteem in young children of color two of the major tasks of early childhood are the development of selfconcept and selfesteem  selfconcept refers to the beliefs attitudes knowledge and ideas people have about themselves  p  children begin to develop a sense of self during the toddler years by twentyone to twentyfour months children can recognize themselves in a mirror and begin to use words such as me i and mine as a way of demonstrating and asserting their individuality when asked to describe themselves toddlers do so in terms of concrete observable characteristics related to their abilities activities and possessions  selfesteem involves an overall evaluation of ones value or worth as a person  p  although toddlers are unable to verbalize their selfesteem because of cognitive limitations they do communicate selfesteem through their actions and behaviors  research shows that children with high self esteem appear confident curious and independent they are able to adjust to changes and transitions to tolerate frustration and to handle conflict  both selfconcept and selfesteem develop from the interaction of messages passed on by parents and society racial and ethnic prejudices often make it difficult for children of color to develop positive feelings of competency and worth according to tatum  the impact of racism begins early when young children are exposed to misinformation about themselves or people who are different from themselves images are internalized and assumptions are formed that may go unchallenged for years psychologist william cross  has developed a theory of racial identity development that contains five stages preencounter encounter immersionemersion internalization and internalizationcommitment the first stage is pertinent to this article in the preencounter stage children of color absorb many of the beliefs and values of the dominant white culture including the belief that it is better to be white stereotypes omissions and distortions combined with an image of white superiority play a role in socializing children of color to value the role models lifestyles and images of beauty of white culture over those of their own cultural group   countering the story of white superiority is critical to the positive growth and development of selfesteem and selfconcept in children of color multicultural childrens literature past and present one of the key strategies suggested for counteracting the prejudices and stereotypes that can negatively impact a child of colors developing sense of selfconcept and selfesteem is to create an environment at home in day care centers and in preschools that reflects diversity    multicultural books along with multicultural dolls toys wall decorations dvds and tv programs can contribute to the development of positive self esteem by providing children of color with images of themselves multicultural books also provide motivation for reading however as rudine sims bishop points out if books are to provide mirrors  the images they offer ought to be clear and undistorted  p  until the s most literature for children contained no characters or settings other than white mainstream united states culture the few items that did contain multicultural characters or settings were often inaccurate and insensitive  nancy larricks groundbreaking study of over  childrens books published between  and  showed that only  percent included one or more black characters  fewer than  percent of those books featured contemporary african americans in her report larrick not only pointed out the hurtful effects this has on black children but also discussed the impact it has on society as a whole when the only images children see are white ones there seems to be little chance of developing the humility so urgently needed for world cooperation  as long as children are brought up on gentle doses of racism through their books  p  larricks study combined with the growing awareness of diversity issues spawned by the civil rights movement led to the beginning of the multicultural publishing movement in youth literature almost two decades after larricks study rudine sims bishop conducted another extensive analysis of youth literature to determine the extent to which the characterization of african americans in youth literature had changed shadow and substance afroamerican experience in contemporary childrens fiction  found that the percentage of books including african americans had increased but that many of the representations continued to be stereotypical and negative bishop identified three main categories of books dealing with african american themes  socially conscious books were those written to help white children understand the experiences of nonwhites or people of color meltingpot books depicted whites and nonwhites together without differentiating among them and showed people of color to be no different than whites other than skin color culturally conscious books were written for african american youth and reflected the uniqueness as well as the universality of the african american experience shadow and substance reinforced the fact that evaluating multicultural literature based on plot themes and characters is not enough instead it is critical to consider the cultural and social context of the literature today although attention to multicultural literature continues the issues identified by larrick  and bishop  remain prominent the changing demographics of the united states continue to outpace the publication of multicultural titles according to the cooperative childrens book center ccbc which has been tracking for over a decade the number of books they receive by and about people of color the number of multicultural titles published each year has remained static  as gail willett notes when children cannot identify with a book or see their lives celebrated through stories it may have a negative impact on their selfimage the message they get is that their lives and their stories are not important  p  representations of ethnicity and culture too remain an issue in evaluating and selecting multicultural literature issues such as visual and verbal stereotyping authenticity and authority perspective and world view and underlying ideology must be considered  p  while the quality of multicultural literature has improved  inaccuracies and stereotypes can still be found in childrens books  as banks  notes books that present inaccurate portrayals of people of color confuse children reinforce stereotypes and can even be the source of harmful misconceptions for both children of color and white children finding images that reflect the diversity within families of color is also a challenge it is often difficult for example to find childrens books depicting african american children with very dark or very light skin  the same is true for images of hispanic children a recent study of américas and belpré awardwinning picture books found that the majority of the titles depicted hispanics as having brown eyes accompanied by dark hair and skin commonly referred to as the latin look  p  images of multiracial or multicultural children are also difficult to find tatum  and jamie naidoo  both note the dearth of mixedrace characters in childrens books despite the fact that over  million americans were counted as more than one race in the  census  critical race theory critical race theory crt is a multidisciplinary epistemology developed by legal scholars in the s to address the effects of race and racism in the us legal system critical race theory decenters the prominent position of class and socioeconomic status found in critical legal studies and repositions race as the primary lens for exploring legislation and its political enactments  p  a key goal of critical race theory is to bring about change that will lead to social justice  critical race theory has been applied within the context of education to examine the role race plays in a number of areas including curriculum  school funding  and school discipline policies  recently critical race theory has been used to examine childrens literature  a basic premise of critical race theory is the permanence of race according to jonda mcnair racism is embedded into the fabric of our everyday lives and often appears natural instead of abnormal to most americans  p  as such critical race theory scholars argue that racism defined as a system of privileges that works to the advantage of whites and to the detriment of people of color  p  has played and continues to play a dominant role in determining inequity in the united states examples of white privilege include being able to walk into an advanced placement english class and see whites well represented not being routinely followed while shopping and not being asked to speak for all whites   another essential element of critical race theory is counterstorytelling counterstorytelling is defined as a method of telling a story that aims to cast doubt on the validity of accepted premises or myths especially ones held by the majority  p  it offers a perspective that both helps us understand what life is like for others and invites the reader into a new and unfamiliar world  p  critical race theory scholars believe that by giving voice to the marginalized counterstories validate their life circumstances and serve as powerful ways to challenge and subvert the versions of reality held by the privileged interest convergence theory the final tenet of crt that will be used in this study maintains that people of color will not achieve racial advances unless those advances intersect with the economic interests of whites  derrick bell  argues for example that many of the civil rights gains within communities of color have occurred because they converge with the selfinterests of whites and do not require major disruptions to the normal way of life for the majority of whites he offers the brown v board of education decision as an example according to bell the brown decision made very little substantive difference in the lives of most whites however it led to the closing of schools in black neighborhoods the dismissal of many african american teachers and administrators the implementation of practices such as tracking and the placement of a disproportionate number of african american students in special education classes all of which make the social gains from brown questionable design of the study the research questions which guided this study were  what percentage of board books published and reviewed in the last five years  feature people of color  what individual groups of color are represented and to what extent  for the books which include children of color what races and ethnicities are the authorsillustrators when selecting the sample for the study we limited our study to board books published between  and  since we were interested in examining the race or ethnicity of the featured characters we included only board books that contained people finally because librarians and educators most often purchase books that have been reviewed we included only board books that had been reviewed we chose content analysis as our methodology for the study our unit of analysis was the individual board book using books in print online we identified  books that met our criteria percent of the total number of board books published and reviewed between  and  we then obtained and examined each book recording the following information for each  bibliographic information  race or ethnicity of characters  race or ethnicity of authors and illustrators and  whether the book was a picture book reissued as a board book the race or ethnicity of the author for each title was determined using gale something about the author httpwwwgalecengagecom publishers web pages and authors personal web pages we recognize that this study is not without limitations in most cases our determination of the race or ethnicity of the people portrayed was dependent on photographs or illustrations determining the race or ethnicity of a person from a photograph or illustration can prove difficult for individuals who have not been acculturated to the group being portrayed since we used books in print online to select our sample the reviewing sources were limited to those indexed in books in print online three of the most frequently used standard selection tools for librarians and other adult intermediaries who purchase books for children school library journal booklist and publishers weekly are among the fortyone reviewing sources indexed in books in print at the time the sample was developed books in print online also indexed críticas a monthly review of spanishlanguage adult and childrens titles findings racial and ethnic representation of the people depicted our analysis revealed that the board books fell into five categories table  shows the racialethnic breakdown for each of these categories a bibliography of all  titles organized by category can be found at httpwwwsitesgooglecomsiteinsideboardbookshome looking across the five categories it is apparent that white infants toddlers and adults far outnumbered people of color one hundred ninety six or  percent of the books contained white characters including thirteen from the bilingualspanish language category three from the international category and all of the titles in the category labeled books that featured people from multiple racial and ethnic groups in contrast only eighty  percent of the books in the sample contained people of color and just twentytwo  percent contained only people of color including eight from the bilingualspanish category and two from the international category each category is discussed in detail below table  racialethnic groups represented category number  books in which all of the people were white   books that featured only people of color    african american    biracial   bilingualspanish language    white only    hispanic only    white people of color race ethnicity indeterminable    native alaskan   books that featured people from multiple racial and ethnic groups    white african american    white african american asian    white people of color race ethnicity indeterminable    white african american asian hispanic    white asian   books in which the characters were international    people of color only    white people of color   noten    does not include books that are bilingualspanish language or international   the numbers do not add up to  or  percent because all of the books in the multiple racial and ethnic category contain both white individuals and people of color books in which all of the people were white one hundred thirty  percent of the titles fell into this category all of the people depicted in these books were white there was no multicultural representation therefore no further analysis was performed on these books books that featured only people of color this category was represented by twelve  percent books these books featured only people of color and were not bilingualspanish language or international in focus of these titles eleven featured african american infants toddlers or families one of the books little mister specifically featured a biracial child it is possible that some of the individuals pictured in the other books were biracial or multiracial for publication information for this and other board books mentioned in this article see the appendix in shades of black for example the photographs showed children with a range of skin and eye colors as well as hair textures five of the titles originally appeared in a picture book format one such title is welcome precious the remaining seven books were originally published as board books each of these books presented activities toddlers enjoy from exploring the garden to playing with pots and pans to turning somersaults the language in the books varied from the unremarkable prose of my little toolbox to the poetic verse of whose toes are those books that featured people from multiple racial and ethnic groups fifty of the board books  percent were not bilingualspanish language or international yet featured people from multiple racial and ethnic groups all of the books in this category contained at least one white character in fact in all except three of these books the frequency of white representation exceeded that of people of color in two of the books jazzy jobs and lets play the numbers were equal subway which shows an african american mother and her daughter riding the subway featured more people of color overall in this category african american adults and children were the people of color most frequently depicted followed by asian american adults and children we could identify no alaskan native american indian or native hawaiian children or adults in any of the books in this category in many of the books it was difficult to determine the race or ethnicity of the people of color because they all shared similar physical features the only difference was the shade of brown used for their skin this category as a whole was a mixture of reissued picture books concept books renditions of popular nursery rhymes and didactic tools bilingual or spanish language books twentyone  percent of the books were bilingual or spanish language titles the majority fourteen of books in this category were concept books household objects toys and common animals figured prominently in most of these books both the spanish and english word was used to identify the featured objects for example in lets govamos a vivajar each doublepage spread showed a form of transportation the english word was on the lefthand page the spanish word was on the righthand page the characters in these books were secondary and the majority of them were white one exception was the series of wordless concept books written by jill hartley who identifies herself as francoamericanmexican all of the people pictured in these books were hispanic according to the publishers web site the photographs were taken in mexico and depict mexican objects and cultural artifacts seven of the books in this category were storybooks two of them were spanishlanguage translations of popular picture books me quieres mama is a spanish translation of the popular mama do you love me and features an alaska native child and her mother fiesta is a bilingual book originally published in  four of the children depicted appear to be hispanic while the other two appear to be white caillou la hora del baño and caillou eso es mío are spanish translations of two of the books in the caillou series which chronicles the adventures of a french toddler the other three storybook titles belong to the dora the explorer series these titles are written primarily in english with the occasional introduction of a spanish word dora and her family are hispanic international or global books this category was represented by five titles intended to present a global view of childhood each of these books used vibrant photographs of children from around the world in their homes and communities to convey this message in happy birthday and to be a kid the children that represented the united states were white in global babies there were two photographs from the united states one pictured a white infant the other an american indian infant the remaining two titles in this category included a counting book set on an unidentified caribbean island and a tribute to gauguin racialethnic representation of the authors and illustrators overall the authors and illustrators of the board books in the sample were white of the books which featured only african american infants toddlers andor families four of the books were written and illustrated by african american authors and illustrators five were written and illustrated by white authors and illustrators and two were written by an african american author and illustrated by an asian american illustrator little mister which features a biracial toddler was written and illustrated by randy duburke who is african american of the seven books that featured only hispanic children andor adults four were by jill hartley a francoamericanmexican photographer none of the other books in the bilingualspanish language category appeared to be written or illustrated by a hispanic author or illustrator we were only able to determine the authors for two of the three dora the explorer books and both were white me quieres mama the only book to feature an alaskan native child and her mother was written and illustrated by white individuals as noted earlier fifty of the books featured characters from multiple ethnic and racial groups we were able to identify the race or ethnicity of thirtythree of the authors and thirty of the illustrators only one book the book of things that go zoom was illustrated by an african american illustrator the other authors and illustrators were white discussion clearly hornings  assertion is still correct despite the increasing ethnic and racial diversity in the united states board books that feature people of color remain a rarity even rarer seems to be the creation of board books by authors and illustrators of color we will employ two lensesthe typology developed by bishop  in shadow and substance and critical race theoryto explore the significance of our findings similarities with bishops typology during our analysis we were struck by the similarities we noticed between our findings and those bishop discovered in her analysis of picture books representing people of color in   the majority of the board books in the sample that featured people from multiple racial and ethnic groups appeared to be meltingpot booksbooks that depicted people of color and whites together without differentiating among them often the only difference in the illustrated characters was the hue of their skin all the other physical attributes remained the same in these books race is made irrelevant little more than a matter of skin color a series by michelle sinclair colman typifies this approach in country babies wear plaid illustrator nathalie dion uses the same slender tall figure to depict mothers of various races these moms are all taking part in the same activities in the same settingsnothing is different but the color of their skin as mongo points out just painting the faces of characters brown in a book is not sufficient  p  it is critical that the illustrations in books reflect realistic features of people of color portray people of color in believable situations and be culturally accurate    although it might be argued that it is difficult in an eightpage board book to do all of this or that an illustrators style might prohibit this as mongo argues authors and illustrators have a responsibility to provide resources which allow all children as they grow to understand and to value themselves  p  culturally conscious books are defined as books written for african american youth that reflect the uniqueness as well as the universality of the african american experience  we found that this description applied to the eight books in the sample about african americans that were written by african americans each of these books celebrated african american identity the illustrations depicted a wide range of skin colors hair styles and body types and showed children as part of loving families as bishop explains when african american artists illustrate books about african americans they create attractive realistic recognizably african american children  p  as stated earlier a number of these titles originally appeared as picture books it appears that rather than commissioning wellestablished authors and illustrators of color to create true board books many publishing houses mined their backlists for board book reissues this stands in sharp contrast to the trend in the late s and early s when publishing houses such as black butterfly press and just us books worked with african american authors and illustrators to produce true board books that depicted african american families and culture those efforts resulted in several board book titles many of which are no longer in print that served as models of quality board books for african american infants and toddlers  we expected at least some of the bilingualspanish language books to fall into the culturally conscious category that is to depict the uniqueness as well as the universality of the hispanic experience they did not instead the lack of hispanic characters and cultural representation in the majority of these books seems to suggest that the intended audience for them is primarily children in englishspeaking households who are learning spanish as a second language the focus seems to be on learning the language not on featuring the people or the culture the only exceptions were the jill hartley books discussed above and while the publishers web site indicates that the photographs are of mexican objects it would probably be more appropriate to say they are objects photographed in mexico many of the items pictured are not representative of mexican cultureyoyos for example the lack of books representing the hispanic experience stands in sharp contrast to current demographic data showing that  percent or roughly  million of all children under the age of eighteen in the united states are hispanic of these  million children  percent are under the age of five  the three dora the explorer board books are particularly problematic a number of latinoa scholars argue that dora distorts latinoa identity making it seem that there is one singular authentic latinoa culture  p  according to nicole guidottihernández  this is politically dangerous because it leads nonhispanics to assume that all hispanics are like dora and thus are all the same to address better the needs of hispanic children the publishing houses could commission hispanic authors and illustrators such as pat mora and david diaz to create true board books that provide multiple mirrors on the hispanic experience if nothing else they could mine their backlists for appropriate picture book titles by hispanic authors and illustrators to convert into board books the final category identified by bishop is the social conscience booksbooks created from an ethnocentric nonafrican american perspective  many of the books in this category contain stereotypes feast for  appears to be one of these books the book features an african american family and begins with the mother and her children shopping for dinner the family is largethere are five children among the items they are buying are chickens to fry and bunches of greens while these details may appear innocuous they help to perpetuate longstanding stereotypes about african americans as bishop points out no matter how innocent the story and how wellmeaning the author a book like this cannot be divorced from the sociocultural and political environment out of which it grew and the one into which it will be released  p  critical race theory we believe that white privilege is apparent in the production and publication of board books our findings show that the parents of white children can easily purchase board books that feature characters that look like their children assuring that their children see themselves over and over in books from infancy thus at a very young age white children receive the message from books that they are important and according to critical race theory scholars the message that to be white is better parents of children of color on the other hand will find it almost impossible to locate board books that show their childrens faces or cultures especially if their children are native alaskan american indian native hawaiian hispanic or biracial even if parents do find board books that include children of color the representations may be inauthentic or monolithic the lack of board books featuring children of color denies these children an important resource for developing a positive selfconcept instead beginning in infancy children of color not only get the message from books that their lives and their stories are not important but also that to be white is better the fact that all of the books that featured characters from multiple racesethnic groups included white children andor adults can be considered another subtle manifestation of racism there were no books that featured for example only african american and hispanic children together each time more than one race or ethnicity was depicted there were also white characters and as stated in the findings in all except three of the fifty books in this category the number of white individuals outnumbered the number of individuals of color while it might be argued that this accurately reflects the us population it can also be argued that this normalizes whiteness it sends a subtle message that people of color play supporting roles in american society a stereotype that the council on interracial books for children warned about in  in their brochure  quick ways to analyze childrens books for racism and sexism  as discussed above another tenet of critical race theory is counterstorytelling the majority of the board books in the sample were written and illustrated by whites effectively excluding the voices and viewpoints of people of color there were a few books in the sample which could be interpreted as counterstories shades of black for example challenges the oftenheld misconception that african americans have similar physical features in this book sandra pinkney uses terms like golden brown and velvety orange to describe the skin color of the children in the photographs their hair is described as soft puffs and twisted corkscrews and their eyes are amber green ebony and blue tickle tickle welcome precious and little mister counter the belief held by many in the majority culture that most african american children grow up lacking positive male adult role models these three books feature fathers cuddling tickling and holding their infants and toddlers even the dora the explorer books with their shortcomings provide a counter story to commonly held beliefs about hispanic women which include obedience to the church submission to men and limited participation in public discourse  p  as guidottihernández  notes to the contrary dora is an adventurous independent geographically mobile problem solver one final tenet of critical race theory appears to be at play herethe theory of interest convergence according to this theory publishers of board books would be willing to commission authors and illustrators of color to create board books that featured characters of color if the companies believed people of color would purchase them and they would profit financially as mcnair explains in this scenario the intellectual interests of people of color and the economic interests of whites would converge  p  unfortunately despite evidence to the contrary a common stereotype persists that people of color do not buy books   according to the book industry study group in the year  african americans spent approximately  million in total book expenditures   this same study found that african americans who were active book buyers prefer to purchase books written by african american authors   a study conducted by the selig center for economic growth found that asian american consumers spend dramatically more than the average us household on education which includes books  mcnair  notes that in my familyen mi familia a recipient of the pura belpré award has sold more than  copies these figures indicate that if board books that featured people of color were published and appropriately marketed it is likely that the publishing industry would find the endeavor to be financially rewarding appropriate marketing is key as mcnair  points out african americans tend to read reviews published in magazines such as essence rather than utilize best seller lists published in newspapers like the new york times mongo  reiterates this point and adds that because african americans have difficulty locating books by and about african americans in many of the mainstream bookstores they tend to shop in smaller independent bookstores the same may be true for other people of color thus a planned effort would be needed on the part of publishing houses to ensure profitability conclusion as walter dean myers argues all children not just those who belong to the majority culture have a right to read stories depicting their lives and experiences  responding to the absence of authors and illustrators of color in book club order forms mcnair states that there is simply no excuse not to include more titles by african americans asian americans latinos and native americans  p  this conclusion is no less true of board books especially given the potential role they play in the development of selfconcept among children of color central to critical race theory is the promotion of social justice through change the primary goal of the association for library services to children alsc is to lead the way in forging excellent library service for all children  in  public libraries in the united states spent more than  billion on library collections  in  circulation of childrens materials was  percent of the total circulation and attendance at childrens programs totaled  million  public library usage data shows that people of color are just as likely as whites to use public libraries  perhaps it is time for librarians to use our financial capital and our professional credibility to challenge the large mainstream publishers to provide board books for children of color we also need to purchase books from small independent presses that not only focus on issues of multiculturalism and diversity but are often owned and operated by people of color the ccbc provides an uptodate list of african american american indian asian american and hispanic presses see httpwwweducationwisceduccbcbookspclistasp by helping to ensure that infants and toddlers of color see reflections of themselves from a very early age the library profession will be continuing to play a leadership role in the ongoing fight for equity and equality in american society
