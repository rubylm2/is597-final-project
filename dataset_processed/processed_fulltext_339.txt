public opinion toward user fees in public libraries mark t kinnucan mark r ferguson and leigh estabrook the issue of user fees in public libraries has been debated extensively in the library community in the last several years since their origins in the nineteenth century american public libraries have relied almost exclusively on public funding an examination of their nature as public goods however reveals public library services to be as much private goods as public goods this conclusion based on economic grounds is supported by surveys of public opinion toward user fees in libraries which have typically found the general public to be more tolerant of fees than librarians in this study we reanalyzed the data from a national telephone poll of  us residents conducted in  by the library research center at the university of illinois when asked what they would like to see done if their local public library were facing a fiscal crisis  percent of those voicing an opinion favored raising taxes while  percent favored instituting user fees the remaining  percent advocated a reduction in services we used the framework of discrete choice analysis to determine whether attitudes toward fees and taxes stem more from citizens own self interests or more from their political outlook we found greater support for self interest as an explanation in particular more frequent library use urban residence a higher level of education and greater income were all associated with a greater preference for taxes over fees or service cuts introduction whether or not to charge fees for library services is a difficult question for many public librarians the issue has been thoroughly debated in  this article is a revision of a paper that was presented at library research seminar i tallahassee florida november   psi  north rocky point drive west tampa florida  this research was conducted while mark t kinnucan was in the graduate school of library and information science at the university of western ontario  compusearch  front street toronto ontario mv b canada this research was conducted while mark r ferguson was in the department of geography at the university of toronto support from the social sciences and humanities research council of canada through its funding of a postdoctoral fellowship at the university oftoronto is acknowledged  graduate school of library and information science university of illinois at urbanachampaign  east daniel street champaign illinois  libravy quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
 the library quarterly the library community   where there is a prevailing sentiment against the imposition of fees  although debates over fees have been carried on for decades they gained new currency in the s with the financial cutbacks faced by many public libraries and with the introduction of various electronic services and media into public libraries  both trends have continued and in some cases have been magnified in the s furthermore the past decade and a half have seen the rise of significant pushes for smaller government and privatization of services among both academic economists and government policy makers this trend also has implications for the fee versus free debate in public libraries it is not clear that the general public shares the aversion to user fees expressed by most librarians in fact public opinion seems to be divided on the issue in the survey underlying the present research nearly half of the respondents to a hypothetical question favored user fees as a means for their local public library to respond to a fiscal crisis a similar division of opinion was evident in a survey conducted twenty years ago  the purpose of the present study is to assess the determinants of public opinion on this issue are there clear socioeconomic and locational characteristics among the people who approve or do not ap prove of fees in public libraries are there readily identifiable reasons for why the views of the public may differ from those of the library community in answering these questions we have divided the article into two major sections the first section reviews important background matters such as the origins of public libraries the issue of public versus private goods and research on public opinion toward government spending in general insight from this discussion will form the basis for the second major section a bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis of the current survey data most public libraries in north america trace their roots to the second half of the nineteenth century many reasons can be identified for the widespread adoption of public governance and tax support for libraries at that point in history one reason is the belief at the time that libraries would provide benefits to their potential users in many cases the urban poor which those potential users would have difficulty identifying for themselves  such benefits included the molding of a more educated and enlightened citizenry and for some proponents a more tractable populace  in this way the perceived benefits of free public libraries were very similar to those of universal education  in both cases the benefits were thought to accrue to society as a whole at least as much as to the specific recipients of the services both public libraries and public education were seen to be public goods for the most
user fees  part the development of public libraries was part of the same social movement that led to the establishment of universal compulsory free education  public goods and private goods but are libraries and their services public goods as p giacoma  explains there are several different ways to answer this question in one respect it can be treated strictly as an economic question in an economic analysis public goods and private goods can be differentiated along several dimensions  the two that are most commonly identified are excludability and rivalness   a good is excludable to the extent that free riding can be prevented that is it is excludable to the extent that nonpurchasers of the good are prevented from benefiting from it a good exhibits rivalness to the extent that consumption by one person precludes consumption by another private goods are excludable and rival public goods are not by these two criteria library services can be thought of as either private goods or public goods largely depending on whether the library is thought of as providing materials or information  consider rivalry first it is clear that a book or a periodical article can be read by only one person at a time the book or article is a rival good but the information in the book or article is not consumed by the reader in the same way that groceries or gasoline are consumed since information can be passed on without being consumed the information itself is nonrival  excludability is similarly difficult to enforce libraries could conceivably operate like golf or tennis clubs nonmembers could be barred at the door indeed subscription libraries were commonplace  years ago but it is exceedingly difficult to contain information only among those who have paid for it or are otherwise entitled to it secrets are hard to keep and gossips abound the questions surrounding public and private goods are not merely of academic interest research has been driven since the s by the move to privatize various government enterprises the public choice school in economics especially has championed privatization for example in a historical look at policing and highways in britain b l  one of the classic examples of a public good is the lighthouse the purpose of which is to provide information it is interesting to note in light of the further discussion below that although lighthouses have been cited by economic theorists as examples of public goods at least sincejohn stuart mill an examination of the history of the financing of lighthouses in england shows them actually to have had and to continue to have considerable private funding 
 the library quarterly benson  argued that the eventual development of government provision of these services toward the end of the middle ages and in the modern era was not because of their intrinsic publicness instead the evolving definition of property rights led private individuals to underinvest in the provision of such services benson analysis suggests an array of possible policy prescriptions involving the internalization of various costs and benefits through privatization of rights  p  other economists and policy analysts have taken the opposite position where there is good government the provisions of public goods can often be as efficient and more equitable than are the provisions of market goods to people with unequal incomes  p  although the distinction between public and private goods is often presented as a dichotomy economists are actually more inclined to think of it as a continuum several economists have developed and carried out analyses that attempt to measure the degree of publicness of various government services especially local government services two of these studies are illustrative r a gonzalez t s means and s l mehay  investigated five municipal services including public libraries in nine states they developed regression equations to measure the publicness of the different services carrying out a separate analysis for each service they reasoned that for the services to be considered public goods consumption of them should be invariant with city population and average income these hypotheses stem from the definition of public goods as nonexcludable and nonrival gonzalez et al used municipal expenditures on the different services as a measure of consumption they found that the best fitting parameter values were more consistent with the services being private goods although in a fair number of cases including about half of the library equations the results were indeterminate nonetheless they concluded that the outcome of their study adds some strength to supporters of privatization and weakens support for local government consolidation  p  these conclusions can be questioned based on the authors choice of a measure of consumption if as was mentioned earlier the public good that libraries provide is information it is not at all clear that library expenditures can serve as a proxy for the consumption of library services the second study concerns the publicness of education  public libraries have many connections to education both historically as outlined above and at present for example three of the nine possible roles for public libraries identified in the public library association planning and role settingfor public libraries  are educational in nature and one of them formal education support center makes a

 the library quarterly public opinion toward taxes fees and government spending the decision of whether or not to have user fees in public libraries is more a political decision than an economic one if citizens reject fees for the circulation of best sellers from their libraries economic reasoning to the contrary they have decided that the provision and use of best sellers constitute a public good which should be made available at taxpayer expense  p  and voters continue to make this decision in  fifty out of fifty four public library operating referenda passed in the united states with a combined margin of victory of  percent in favor to  percent opposed  it is important to understand the factors that influence public opinion on the funding of public libraries although there is little previous research on this specific question or on public attitudes toward user charges as a way to fund any government program extensive research has been conducted on the bases of public attitudes toward taxes and spending on various government programs two main factors that are typically identified in these studies are political orientation and economic self interest for example  on the one hand voters attitudes toward government spending are thought to arise from how the voters resolve for themselves the dialectic interplay between two dominant social ideologies economic individualism or the work ethic and social equality or collective responsibility  p  on the other hand voters are hypothesized to support tax policies and spending programs that benefit themselves since public opinion surveys seldom include questions on whether the respondent is a recipient of benefits from particular government programs but see  and  for exceptions demographic variables are often used as proxies for self interest the evidence on the relevant importance of these factors or indeed their strength as predictors of attitudes toward taxes and spending at all is mixed in a study of attitudes toward spending on primarily federal level programs a sanders  found ideology measured as political party affiliation to be a stronger determinant of attitudes than was self interest y hasenfeld and j a rafferty  found essentially the opposite in their study of attitudes toward welfare programs indeed they went on to provide evidence from a path analysis that political ideology itself derives in part from self interest two studies looked specifically at citizen attitudes toward local government taxes and services p a beck h g rainey and c traut  developed linear structural relations lisrel models to explore public attitudes about taxes and services in three florida cities they found that community disaffection a subset of their set of sociopoliti

 the library quarterly a common solution to the problem has been the use of a nested multinomial logit model nmnl rather than the simple mnl if it is anticipated that some of the alternatives in the choice set form a natural subset then nmnl can be used to explicitly model different patterns of relationship with the dependent variable one within subsets and one between subsets if iia does hold the nmnl model is equivalent to the ordinary multinomial logit a useful strategy therefore is to start out by estimating a nmnl in the process a statistical test can be conducted of whether the nested structure can be rejected in favor of the simple mnl which is computationally and conceptually more straighiforward when we conducted this test in our analysis we found no evidence of violation of iia the simple mnl adequately described the data discrete choice analysis was originally developed in the context of modeling actual choice behavior whether it can also be applied to survey data is sometimes questioned especially by economists nonetheless discrete choice models are routinely used to model stated preferences for example in marketing research such applications obviously make the assumption that the choices indicated by participants are indicative of their true underlying preferences rather than as a result of extrinsic considerations bearing this caveat in mind we proceed with the analysis results of the discrete choice analysis the definition and coding of the variables is presented in table  while the results of the model are presented in table  the interpretation of such a model is more complex than that of a regression model the choice probabilities and utilities in a discrete choice model are determined on a relative basis that is the effect of a predictor on one alternative is meaningful only when the alternative attractiveness is interpreted in relation to some reference alternative for each of the independent variables the number of parameters is one less than the number of alternatives for example consider a model with three alternatives as is the case in this article if a predictor has a differential effect on choices among the three alternatives then two parameters will be needed if one alternative is affected differently than the reference alternative while the other is affected the same as the reference alternative one parameter will capture the effect we arbitrarily chose to make raising taxes the reference alternative
