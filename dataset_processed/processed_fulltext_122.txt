recruitment of library school faculty james d ramer philip m turner and j gordon coleman library schools primarily recruit teachers by contacting individuals known in advance to the dean andor faculty or by publicizing an opening and soliciting applications the first is operative most frequently in the recruitment of information scientists and senior faculty the chronicle of higher education appears to be the most effective medium for the second approach the annual alise meeting plays an important role in the recruitment process as well the quality of the faculty is one of the most important factors in determining the reputation of any educational enterprise considerable effort usually accompanied by much anxiety is consequently invested in faculty recruitment in the relatively small universe of a library school each new appointment is critical bringing with it the opportunity to effect substantial improvement in quality despite its importance surprisingly little analysis has been made of the recruitment process itself at least little that has been published one dean may verbally compare notes with another dean friend about recruitment strategies but complete candor is not likely if they are competing for the same type of candidate at the time of the exchange job seekers may confide in one another if they are not likely finalists for the same positions none of these or other such exchanges adds up to generalizable information many questions therefore surround a process whose success is vitally important to the stature if not the survival of a library school in an attempt to gather information beyond the anecdotal the authors of this report decided to make a first effort toward a methodical survey specifically the study had as its primary purpose to determine  if the hiring institution initiated contact with the hired faculty member how did this person come to the notice of the library school  if the hired faculty member initiated contact how did the vacancy come to the notice of the position seeker secondarily this study also attempted james d ramer is dean philip m turner is assistant dean and j gordon coleman is assistant professor graduate school of library service university of alabama po box  university al  mss received  accepted   volume  number 
recruitment of library school faculty to explore relationships between factors such as teaching area rank sex race etc and the recruitment process in late autumn  the authors designed a two part questionnaire to gather data pertinent to faculty recruitment the first part to be completed by library school deans or their office assistants the second by faculty members appointed since january   copies of the questionnaire were mailed to all schools with american library association accredited programs in the united states and canada recipients were requested to complete a set of questionnaires for each regular fulltime teacher hired during the time period under consideration a followup mailing was made in january  canadian responses were not included because of unique factors that impinge upon the recruitment processes north of the border the response rate was  percent although  library schools reported no appointments  reported that their experiences were not relevant to the survey they would have been and  return did not conform to the accompanying instructions in all  usable questionnaires were completed and returned  of part one  of part two the first factor investigated by the questionnaire completed by the dean or surrogate was who first contacted whom and how was that contact established if the library school initiated contact the dean was asked to describe the primary means through which the potential candidate was identified if the applicant initiated contact supplementary information was provided in the questionnaire completed by the appointed faculty member there was evidence that the perception of who initiated the first contact was blurred in a few cases the hiring school viewed itself as being the initiator of the process in  of the hires the faculty members saw themselves as taking the first step in  instances with a maximum of  appointments there is a difference of opinion concerning who first contacted whom in at least five cases this might have been higher had as many faculty as deans responded this difference is not surprising when one considers the at times hectic dynamics of the recruitment process particularly at conventions as well as the frailty of decanal and professorial memories approximately  percent of the  people appointed during the period in question were approached on an individual basis by the hiring school having first been  ominated by the dean or a member of the faculty  instances or by someone external to the hiring school  or having been identified as a potential candidate from an evaluation of the curriculum vitae made available by alise  while the above data indicate that library schools are frequently proactive rather than reactive in their hiring procedures more in depth analysis would suggest that this is truer for certain teaching areas and ranks than for others fall b 
journal of education for library and information science initial contact and teaching area of the  people for whom teaching areas were identified  were in the information science area and  were in other areas of the former   percent were contacted initially by the hiring institution while only   percent of the non information science teachers were sought out of these  no pattern of subject areas was apparent thus there is a significant difference in proportions between information science and non information science teachers x   df   p   initial contact and rank of the  faculty members hired for whom both information regarding initial contact and rank were provided  were appointed at the associate or full professor rank and  at lower ranks seven  percent of the associatefull professors were individually recruited by the hiring institution while only   percent of the instructorassistant professors were again this is a significant difference x   df   p   initial contact and sex forty eight schools provided information regarding gender of the faculty member and initial contact of the  females hired   percent were contacted by the hiring institution while  percent  out of  of the males were contacted by the hiring institution this difference is not statistically significant x   df initial contact and race only  of the faculty who were hired were not white of these   were black and  was asian pacific interestingly enough though all five were female and represented a diversity of teaching areas information science  public libraries  children services  and one not indicated three of the nonwhite faculty appointments were sought out by the hiring school while two initiated contact with the school by responding to the advertisements because of the relatively small number of nonwhite faculty appointed during this time any statistical analysis would probably be meaningless basis for nominations on what basis were the nominations made a close prior acquaintance with the candidate was often involved in several such cases  instances the nominee had previously been a parttime or visiting instructor in the hiring school had been a regular fulltime teacher at an earlier date  was an alumnus  had been a prior colleague at another school or library of the dean or a member of the faculty  or a fellow doctoral candidate  it is evident therefore that in almost  percent of the appointments described in this survey the candidate hired had one or more persons associated with the hiring school as knowledgeable advocates less intimate prior associations included joint service on committees  and social contacts  the basis of  nominations was the  general reputation in the profession of the nominee but in almost all cases this was a second not the sole reason for putting a name into the hopper from the above one might suggest that the old boy network is alive  volume  number 
recruitment of library school faculty and well but this would be a mistake first of course the appointees are not necessarily old boys although complete information was not given for each appointment for those that provided such data  were females  were males second we are dealing with a wide network of acquaintances that includes faculty as well as administrators third and last only  nominations came from sources external to the hiring school and only one of these was solicited gatekeepers find little employment in library education nowadays the curriculum vitae assembled and made available by alise were the basis for a library school initial overture to the person ultimately hired as already stated in  cases a review of these dossiers did not take place until the time of the annual meeting in  cases this is surprising suggesting a more extemporaneous approach to convention interviewing than anticipated by authors in whose school an excruciating amount of prior discussion evaluation and correspondence is elicited by the mailed resumes closely related to this phenomenon is the extent to which a convention alise in all but one case is the site of first contact between the school and the potential applicant whether the person had been nominated or had been selected from the alise packet of curriculum vitae slightly more than half the people asked to apply for the position were first approached at the annual meeting with the escalating costs of travel it appears that more and more schools are using the alise meetings as a site for evaluating and eliminating candidates thereby reducing the number brought to campus for interviews the remaining first contacts were almost equally divided between letter and telephone call the large majority  out of  of the recently hired faculty who indicated that they had initiated contact responded that they first noticed the position vacancy either through a job notice in a publication or a position description at an institution three publications accounted for the overwhelming majority of the job notices chronicle of higher education in which  of the positions were advertised american libraries with  and library journal with  a majority of schools advertised simultaneously in all three distant followers were the asis bulletin  and lj hotline  a few scattered advertisements appeared in aect mla and acm newsletters as well as in local newspapers slightly more than half the schools advertising in the chronicle ran two successive ads while american libraries and the library journal saw a one time announcement about twice as often as a repeated one notices describing a job opening are almost universally circulated to other library schools of the  faculty members who completed the questionnaire  replied that they initiated the contact by responding to an advertisement in a publication  seeing it in the chronicle and  in american libraries these results are surprising and surely not definitive but it is hard to fall  
journal of education for library and information science believe that the advertisements in only two journals came to the active attention of their intended audience ie the successful candidates closely related to these channels  responded to a position description that had been circulated to other institutions  in almost all cases to library schools with ala accredited programs the remaining  faculty members reported that a person not on the faculty of the hiring institution had brought the vacancy to their attention in  of these cases this person was a peer at another institution there appears to be then a minor collegial network that links job seekers despite there being no patronage system operative at the administrative level it appears that library schools with administrators and faculty who have a wide circle of acquaintances use these contacts very effectively in recruiting new faculty members personal contacts are particularly instrumental in the successful recruitment of information scientists and senior professors the annual alise meeting is an active arena for establishing initial contacts interviewing and evaluating prospective teachers despite the effectiveness of proactive recruiting advertisements especially in the chronicle of higher education are helpful in reaching candidates this is particularly true for lower rank openings such public notices in addition to responding to affirmative action requirements also activate a peer network that alerts job seekers to employment opportunities  volume  number
