iwe will not be silent amplifying marginalized voices in lis education and research amelia n gibson and sandra hughes hassell abstract this article focuses on the role of lis faculty and researchers in the aftermath of the  presidential election key points include our responsibility to educate ourselves about marginalization and silencing to help our students build theoretical practical and ethical foundations for engaging with communities in ways that prioritize their needs and uphold the values of the profession to amplify the voices of people systematically targeted by the presidential administrations policies and actions and to engage in public discourse about the implications of current administrative policies as related to the core values of lis such as the right to privacy access freedomof speech and intellectual freedom the article draws parallels between social oppression as demonstrated in campaign rhetoric and presidential policy and institutional oppression within library spaces saw a girl get kicked out of the library last week she was maybe  with long braids and a shy but easy smile she had come into the library with a small group of friends and did not look fully comfortable in the space they sat at a table together in the way that teenage girls dosafety in numbers three or four at a time and with a touch of attitude she was new to this library just as i was glancing up and around at the glass walls and open stacks respectfully quiet except for low whispers to her friends i watched her from my study room my research assistant walked around the library talking to teen girls about our research study she chatted with the girl and her friends and walked away a few minutes later the girl popped her head into the room where i sat and shyly asked a question i smiled answered and watched as she went back to her friends she stood they sat she whispered they whispered and they looked back in my direction i smiled then the guards showed up two guards from opposite ends of the library one stepped uncomfortably close to the girl in a way i have seen before it is the way some adults stand when asserting dominance over black teens with a banal disregard for vulnerability and no sense of impropriety at invading the personal physical space of a teenage girl when the guard spoke the girl flinched and backed up slightly and her face flashed with anger and indigna library quarterly information community policy vol  no  pp    by the university of chicago all rights reserved

  the library quarterlyfour roles for lis faculty in the aftermath of the election know the issues the history of the field and the community if faculty want to make positive impacts on this postelection environment they first need to be willing to confront racism sexism homophobia ableism and other forms of discrimination structural and individual in their research in the classroom among the faculty with community partners and in professional organizations unwillingness to address these issues is not neutrality it is complicity and acquiescence to the replication of broader systems of oppression within libraries and lis programs this complicity results in silencing that at worst completely excludes marginalized groups and at best renders them invisible deconstructing oppressive institutions is not just a matter of goodwill or good intention as faculty we have a responsibility to familiarize ourselves with research relevant to our field and to ground our pedagogy and inquiry in existing theoretical and ethical frameworks this includes the responsibility to make ourselves aware of history current issues and ongoing debates familiarizing ourselves with the stakeholders and affected communities and learning from those who have done the work before us working toward equity is no exception build students theoretical practical and ethical foundations a critical element of working toward equity involves engaging students in explicit discussions about power social structures and the role of information professionals in the creation of systems and services that shape others ability to access information about their lives and the world ignoring concepts such as race intersectionality and power represents tacit promotion of a colorblind epistemology and pedagogy that promotes whiteness as normative dismisses discussion of marginalized experiences as disruption to the norm and unwittingly perpetuates the false narrative that their coursework is neutral and unbiased rather than ideologically and politically informed and racialized cooke sweeney and umoja   shying away from discussions about institutionalized racism sexism ableism classism and other forms of structural oppression might help faculty avoid difficult conversations or might alleviate their fear of being perceived as partisan or politically biased by students or administrators but doing so leaves students unprepared for the task of creating equitable systems once they join the workforce to prepare lis students and graduates to confront oppression to understand how power and privilege shape lis institutions and professional practice cooke et al   to embrace social justice as an lis value pawley  schroeder and hollister  cooke et al  and to understand the ethical implications of their decisions and practices requires that faculty intentionally help students develop the theoretical practical and ethical foundations they will need to engage with marginalized and silenced communities in ways that prioritize their needs and uphold the values of the profession it requires faculty to prepare students to
