the library quarterly volume xii january  number i two major approache s to the social psychology of reading hans muller r qeading has only recently emerged as an object of specialized study from time to time various interest groups have tried to grapple with the practical problems of reading whenever such problems seemed to require solutions within the framework of particular occupational or professional pursuits as long as the results of efforts of this sort proved of immediate social welfare value no need was felt to define the theoretical bases upon which the solutions had been arrived at the bases were simply taken to be set as a matter of course by the practical issues under consideration a few illustrations may suffice to bear out this contention namely that whenever reading behavior is studied a frame of reference is either taken for granted or explicitly indicated that is investigations are rarely carried on in a conceptual vacuum thus an educator who has set himself the task of developing reading ability and reading tastes in pupils may engage in research which compares the effectiveness of different i the author wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness to professor herbert blumer of the department of sociology of the university of chicago whose concepts and point of view greatly influenced the writing of this paper and to professor douglas waples of the graduate library school of the university of chicago who generously took time to read the manuscript and extend advice and criticism i

the social psychology of reading  the aim is usually not so much the control of a baffling concrete situation as it is the elucidation of the reading process in a more general context the difference is perhaps only a superficial one since all genuine that is nonfictitious problems must be grounded in concrete experience nevertheless a consideration of the contrast is illuminating in at least one respect it points to the indispensability of a conceptual framework of some sort whereas the social welfare type of investigation is set within a clearly circumscribed frame of aims and objectives usually of a professional sort the more academic researches of which dissertations and many university press publications are representative examples are frequently either eclectic in their choice of fundamental principles or else lack a well defined conceptual frame of reference altogether what this paper intends to show is i how the adoption of different frames of reference affects the kinds of problem that are selected for investigation and  how different frames of reference determine the choice of certain methods of investigation and the rejection of others these two questions will be discussed with reference to studies of reading within the general field of social psychology according to blumer contemporary social psychology is dominated by two divergent views which may be labeled i the stimulus response approach and  the symbolic interaction approach these two approaches which are also frequently though less descriptively and less accurately referred to as the objective and the subjective emphasis respectively differ in their conceptions of original human nature of group life of so herbert blumer social psychology in e p schmidt ed man and society new york prentice hall  chap iv for a more extensive statement see blumer method in social psychology unpublished phd dissertation department of sociology and anthropology university of chicago i the contrast between the two major approaches in social psychology has also been discussed by other scholars in the field but there is unfortunately no uniformity in the way the two approaches have been labeled blumer designations were chosen for this paper since they seemed to be most descriptive and least subject to misinterpretation reuter terms corresponding to those of blumer are x neurological social psychology and  social interaction social psychology e b reuter some observations on the status of social psychology american journal of sociology xlvi

the social psychology of reading  before an act can be considered completed the impulses that have been aroused must reach consummation in this process of striving toward the satisfaction of an impulse the individual forms wishes or images of goals and in order to reach these goals he is forced to define the situation in which he finds himself in terms of common understandings and expectations symbols shared by his culture group ithus social interaction is not a simple matter of responding to stimulations but rather a matter of responding to or interacting with the meanings of a situation or an event these meanings involve subjective interpretation they represent the product of oth the purposive activities of the individual and the group expectations and folkways which he shares with others the symbolic interaction approach finds its theoretical exponents in c h cooleyi g h mead and w i thomas john dewey is also related to this camp of social psychologists his main contribution consisting of a very penetrating criticism of the stimulus response point of view these rather abstract descriptions of the two major emphases in approaches to problems of social psychology will become more intelligible as their implications for studies of reading are pointed out in the pages to follow in comparing the two approaches it should be kept in mind that in the past much more research has been produced along the stimulus response line than along the symbolic interaction line hence in any attempt at conducting a fair comparison it is necessary to make a clear distinction between theoretical possibilities and fundamentally inescapable limitations on the one hand and practical feasibility and accidental shortcomings on the other hand i human nature and the social order new lyork scribner   mind self and society ed c w morris chicago university of chicago press   w  thomas and florian znaniecki methodological note the polish peasant in europe and america vol i chicago university of chicago press i  is the reflex arc concept psychological treview iii i   see also his human nature and conduct new york holt i 
 the librafry quarterly the stimulus response approach to reading if we adopt the stimulus response approach we may conveniently break up the reading process into two typical spans of response activity namely a the selection of reading matter by an individual and b the effects of reading on individuals a in the selection of reading matter the environment is conceived of as containing a multitude of stimuli in the form of books pamphlets magazines newspapers etc these objects in the environment are assumed to exert a pressure upon the sensory organs of the individual who happens to be exposed to them they appeal to him with different degrees of intensity and in different directions if an appeal is strong enough and at the same time hits a soft spot in the individual psychological makeup a response is expected to occur in the form of book selection this way of viewing the book selection process clearly invites certain lines of research i the available mass of reading matter needs to be classified according to the external stimuli that presumably induce people to purchase or borrow publications and in this attempt at classifying potential stimuli such taxonomic categories as format legibility length recency inclusion of illustrations and pictures color of binding types of display relative popularity of the author and attractiveness of the title suggest themselves  another line of investigation would deal with the distribution of print that is the extent to which different types of publication are accessible to different groups of people it is obvious that stimuli are wasted so to speak unless people are exposed to them the investigation of ecological and geographic factors influencing the relative density or spread of agencies of distribution such as bookstores newsstands libraries etc becomes o cf grace  kelley woodside does read a survey of the reading interests and habits of a local community jamaica ny queens borough public library i l r wilson the geography of reading chicago american library association and university of chicago press  c b joeckel and leon carnovsky a metropolitan library in action chicago university of chicago press 
the social psychology of reading  therefore extremely important in any attempt at estimating the possible degrees of exposure of different groups in the population to different types of publication equally important is the ascertainment of such limiting factors as the cost of publications and the extent to which different publications have been suppressed or publicized in the schools in libraries in periodicals in churches in the movies and on the air  turning to the organism itself which is presumably exposed to these multifarious environmental stimuli in varying degrees a third line of research will tend to center around the determination of the relevant individual characteristics and traits among the more stable traits are age sex education income occupation religion race and group membership of readers these are considered relevant only in their function as facilitating or impeding influences upon the receptivity of an individual to environmental stimuli appearing in the form of printed materials this sensory receptivity is also thought to be affected by a multitude of more modifiable that is less stable factors such as attitudes interests aptitucdes motives and emotional states these predispositions however are again not viewed as dynamic forces that may direct and guide human behavior they are looked upon only in their function as conditioning factors of the neural conductivity of an individual organism engaged in the process of receiving environmental stimuli and producing responses  in the case of book selection the responses are overt and objectively observable the purchase of a newspaper the borrowing of a book the subscribing to a magazine are all clearly identifiable responses to stimuli which the individual receives from the external features of the print filled environment a fourth step of research would be to record such responses and to relate them to the particular stimuli that aroused them the ultimate aim of research of this sort is to make it possible to identify and describe the more or less regular mechanisms that allegedly connect the individual choices of reading matter responses with the external features of print stimuli this requires the isolation of the stimuli in such a way that their specific effects
 the library quarterly in the form of responses can be reliably demonstrated what the investigator is therefore almost inevitably led to is the setting up of experimental situations in which all the relevant variables can be controlled given certain stimuli in the form of different types of publication preferably in a closed community we may try to find out what people with different traits and predispositions choose to read the determination of responses of different individuals to presumably identical stimuli and the determination of responses of essentially identical individuals to different stimuli constitute the two main aims of this type of experimentation such research lends itself to the application of quantitative techniques and the generalizations arrived at have a good chance of turning out to be sufficiently reliable for the guidance of practitioners in group problems of prediction and control relating to reading situations a serious criticism of this quasi laboratory approach charges that the predictive formulas thus arrived at apply by and large only to the somewhat artificial situations from which they were drawn human behavior in contrast to animal behaviorrarely consists of simple stimulus response episodes since it generally involves subjective interpretation prior to the occurrence of a response for instance the act of an individual who is borrowing a novel from a library represents only a highly truncated span of activity which cannot be understood without giving adequate account of all the relevant covert factors such as impulses desires wishes hopes and fears all of which combined determine to a large extent the character of responses this criticism finds expression in blumer general remarks in the study of human beings one cannot confine one self to a mere designation of the external factors which are playing upon such human beings and subsequently a designation of the kinds of reactions which these human  eg erich thier gestaltwandel des arbeiters im spiegel seiner lekitre leipzig harrassowitz  on p  it is shown to what extent members of the working class of the middle class and of a group of college trained people differ in their borrowing of library books on labor and social problems i eg r r shaw the influence of sloping shelves on book circulation library quarterly viii i  
the social psychology of reading  beings make to these factors rather one has to take into consideration the kind of selective tendency or disposition which these human beings have which determines the way in which they are going to react to these external influences playing upon them b in the study of effects of reading the situation is complicated by the fact that such effects are usually not overt reactions as in the case of book selection especially if a distinction is made between what might be called primary immediate and secondary remote effects it can hardly be denied that all the primary effects are of a subjective nature if reading has any influence at all what is changed first that is prior to any overt response are attitudes emotional tensions and subjective states generally propaganda literature for instance will show its ultimate secondary influence in the way people cast their votes but before this overt voting behavior can take place certain changes have to have occurred in the subjective political attitudes of individuals such attitude changes are exemplified by conversion reinforcement of previously held notions adoption of new points of view weakening of the intensity of predispositions through catharsis and so on accordingly present day research in the field of reading effects if it adheres to the ideals of objectification and the standards of scientific reliability is confronted by a disconcerting dilemma i it either limits its attention to overt responses which as can be objectively observed tend to follow reading experiences and thus exposes itself to the charge that it has neglected a consideration of the intervening subjective phases which allegedly constitute the crucial aspects of the reading act  or it attempts to catch the effects occurring within the subjective phases by means of objective techniques such as standardized attitude tests which most critical observers in the symbolic interaction camp do not regard as particularly suitable for getting at the actual modifications of the subjective  herbert blumer an appraisal of thomas and znaniecki the polish peasant in europe and america critiques of research in the social sciences no i new york social science research council  p 
io the library quarterly inner tendencies of individuals who have been exposed to given types of printed propaganda material no matter whether we study reading along one or the other of these two lines it becomes again necessary first to classify the potential stimuli issuing from the content such an analysis of the content of publications enables the investigator to identify the stimuli that may be expected to impinge upon readers provided that the categories which such an analysis uses have been selected with special reference to possible effects of reading and the predispositions of readers thus a subject classification of books magazines or magazine articles would be useless in this context unless the categories were related to differences in actual subject interests of readers one of the most serious shortcomings of such a pioneering endeavor as walter hofmann die lektiure der fraui is the fact that its subject categories based as they are on conventional library classification do not seem to be very closely related to the reading interests and reading satisfactions of people this explains the extreme difficulties which hofmann encountered in his attempt at interpreting the impressive mass of data he had assembled the subject groupings of books in the library if they are to be used as valid instruments of research must be constructed in accordance with the elementary forms of human reading interests and our entire investigation die lektuire der fraul suffered from the fact that this fundamental principle could not be followed we were only able to use expedient subject groupings as they were found in the experimental library these expedient subject groupings which did not represent what we should have wanted to use in an ideal set up were based on traditional academic concepts and classifications subject classification of reading content represents however only one of several possible dimensions of analysis examples  a full discussion of the reasons for disqualifying some of these objective testing devices would fall outside the scope of the present paper  leipzig quelle  meyer   ibid p i the original of this somewhat free translation reads as follows die reagenzgruppen miussten wenn sie vollwertiges untersuchungsmittel sein sollten im zuge der grundformen des menschlichen interesses am buch aufgebaut sein und hieran krankt unsere ganze untersuchung wir konnen nur mit ganz behelfsmissigen eagenzgruppen arbeiten so wie sie in der versuchsbiicherei gebildet wurden diese behelfsmassigen reagenzgruppen sind gebildet in anlehnung an die traditionelle begriffsbildung der wissenschaft

 the library quarterly terpreted as constituting a strong stimulus and low frequency a weak stimulus on the ground of this assumption the relative frequency of occurrence of a content element provides a clue for estimating the probable strength of the relevant response thus it may be predicted or assumed that in countries where children literature shows a high frequency of nationalistic symbols a strong feeling of nationalism will be induced in the younger generation such a hypothesis requires of course verification before it can be accepted as true or probable precisely how such verification is to be conducted in a realistic and feasible way is not too easy to imagine the difficulty is again one of isolating the stimulus we do not know to what extent differences in the intensity of nationalistic sentiment among youth is due to nothing else but differences in the nationalistic tincture of the reading matter to which children in different countries have been exposed there are a great many other factors than reading that might have influenced and shaped nationalistic feelings of a certain strength hence in his desire to be scientific the investigator is again driven to the necessity of setting up situations in which all the relevant factors can be controlled one such possibility would be to select a closed community of children eg an orphanage or a reformatory and expose one group of children to literature which has a high frequency of nationalistic symbols and another group to literature which contains only a few nationalistic symbols but a large number of international symbols the attitudes of both groups of children would have to be tested before and after the exposure if any significant differences in attitude changes with respect to nationalism or internationalism are detected between the two groups after exposure to a sufficient quantity of the respective types of juvenile literature they may be ascribed to the influence of reading provided that it can be shown that such differences in attitude changes are not due to differences in predispositions martin was not interested in ascertaining the effects of different types of children books her problem was merely that of identifying the conditions that tend to affect the degree of acceptance or rejection of different types of children books in different countries
the social psychology of reading  this type of experimental verification has frequently been applied to problems of educational psychology in the field of mass communication the experimental approach has received wide use in the study of the influence of motion pictures briefly the procedure has been to measure the attitude of a group of students by means of an attitude scale or a paired comparison schedule to show the group a motion picture which has been judged as having effective value on the issue in question and to measure the attitude of the group again the day after the picture has been shown essentially the same approach has been proposed as a next step in studies of the social effects of reading the first step would be to select an observed effect of reading eg greater sympathy toward the american negro after reading richard wright native son the next step would be to select groups of readers whose predispositions are known to differ   such predispositions would need to be distinguished by reliable scales scales which can be readministered after the members of each group have read the book such changes in attitude in either direction as the two scalings may record for each group would be taken with due precautions to show how far the influence can be ascribed to the book as against the readers predispositions   the purpose is to analyze the responses of readers to certain selected publications when the readers are known to differ in certain predispositions which are presumed to qualify their responses to the reading once again it must be stated that sociopyschological experiments of this sort even if we dismiss for the time being all legitimate doubts as to the very possibility of establishing a closed system in social experimentation are open to serious criticism on the ground that the findings apply normally only to the rather artificial situations from which they were derived stimuli so it may be argued never act singly they always  eg b m sherrington methods of education in international attitudes teachers college contributions to education no  new york columbia university   ruth c peterson and l l thurstone motion pictures and the social attitudes of children new york macmillan i p xv  waples et al op cit pp   it should be stated that this research proposal does not represent all that waples and his coauthors envisage as needed research in the field of reading it is evident that the formulation of this particular proposal is strongly influenced by considerations of feasibility in terms of available or anticipated research funds
i the library quarterly operate in combination with other stimuli in their mutual interaction two stimuli may either neutralize or reinforce each other depending both on the character of the stimuli and on the particular purposive selective tendencies of the exposed organisms hence relatively little light is shed on the formation of attitudes assuming now that the elucidation of this social process constitutes the aim of this type of research by a meticulous attempt to determine the influence of a single kind of stimulus eg nationalistic symbols in juvenile literature in isolation from other print and nonprint stimuli furthermore it is questionable as was previously indicated whether an attitude scale is capable of measuring the complex total pattern of the results of past experiences with any acceptable degree of adequacy summary of the stimulus response approach in this critical discussion of the approach to reading behavior within the stimulus response scheme an attempt has been made to indicate both the types of problem that might be selected for scientific investigation and the methods that are available in solving such problems it was shown that the major interest would be to study in various contexts the allegedly constant types of connection a between the external stimuli of publications and the responses made by individuals in the way they select publications for reading or b between analytically distinguishable content elements of publications and the effects of reading on different sorts of people in terms of either subjective reactions or overt behavior the precise determination of the causal or covariational connections within each of these two types of stimulus response spans constitutes the goal of researches in reading the aim then is to arrive at generalizations principles or laws which may serve as instruments of prediction and social control of group behavior two questions need to be answered at this point one is in what sense if any do the generalizations concerning group effects of reading and of print stimuli apply to the prediction of individual behavior  the second question is are abstract generalizations and formulas of prediction necessarily the goal of
the social psychology of reading is the social scientist who is concerned about the illumination of reading behavior if not what else could be the aim of researches in reading the first question can probably best be answered by quoting g w allport the argument for prediction is bedeviled by a failure to recognize two kinds of prediction a actuarial prediction concerning whole populations of people and b individual prediction concerning the possibilities of action for a single person social scientists have confused the probability of action within a population with the probability of what a given individual will do to say that  per cent of the population will go to the moving pictures this week does not mean that any given individual has a  per cent chance of going  to know what his chance is we must study him  the only way in which we can predict the chances that a given individual has of behaving in a certain way is to study him as an individual and especially his subjective mental processes with the aid of subjective categories these remarks are directly relevant to studies of reading virtually all the systematic investigations of reading behavior conducted in the past have been concerned with what g w allport calls actuarial prediction this does not mean that they have no potential value in guiding social action and in determining the policies of print distributing agencies on the contrary if a librarian knows the relative appeal which different types of publication possess for different groups among the patrons of a library he will be in a better position than without this knowledge to supply the public with the types of publications they like provided that satisfying the demands of library patrons is one of the objectives of a public libraryz studies of the reading interests or subject interests in relation to objectively determinable characteristics of readers such as age  supplementary statement in herbert blumer in appraisal of thomas and znaniecki the polish peasant in europe and tmerica p i  for summaries of such studies see w s gray and ruth munroe the reading interests and habits of adults new york macmillan i douglas waples people and print chicago university of chicago press i and waples et al op cit x cf leon carnovsky the evaluation of public library facilities in l r wilson ed library trends chicago university of chicago press  carnovsky although admitting the wide prevalence of this assumption raises questions as to its legitimacy
l the librafry quarterly sex occupation and education may be of great value to librarians publishers and others concerned with the dissemination of knowledge and yet studies of this sort would have to make no explicit mention of the character of the subjective experiences which individuals undergo in reading it is equally evident however that those who have to deal primarily with problems of individual behavior readers advisers in libraries social workers psychiatrists etc will derive relatively little if any benefit from stimulus response studies of reading which of necessity due to their sociopsychological preconceptions as well as the limitations of their methods of investigation pay scant attention to the subjective phase of the reading experience to do justice to the second question posed above namely the desirability of obtaining generalizations concerning reading behavior would require a much more extended discussion than can be given in the present context it may suffice to indicate that the wish to arrive at so called laws of human behavior represents the attempt to make the social sciences pragmatically as serviceable as the natural sciences proved to be since the chief tools supplied by the natural sciences are scientific laws the social sciences are supposed to perform the analogous function through the development of social laws in order to enable us to predict and control human behavior such as reading the social sciences so it is argued must provide intellectual instruments in the form of universal propositions which indicate the normal effects of given factors under different conditions the molding of public opinion through propaganda techniques represents an example of a very important stimulus response type of situation where an increased knowledge of invariant patterns of reaction would be extremely useful however as was pointed out by g w allport actuarial generalizacf douglas waples and r w tyler what people want to read about chicago american library association and university of chicago press i  for a more extended discussion of this problem see generalization in the social sciences in louis wirth ed eleven twenty six a deade of social science research chicago university of chicago press  pp  
the social psychology of reading i tions offer at best only a very scanty clue as to how a given individual will react in a given situation or what particular print stimulus will bring about a desired reaction in a given individual a more fundamental question may very well be raised however by asking whether human behavior can be predicted and controlled in the same mechanistic fashion as the events of natural science such a possibility would be denied by many students of human nature on the ground that the crucial part of behavior is the subjective phase with reference to this subjective phase some writers on social science methodology have gone so far as to adopt what might be labeled a defeatist attitude among librarians butler has for instance declared that science can not penetrate the self consciousness of emotion for this is intangible and incommunicable hope happiness aspiration repentance despair and devotion are terms void of all external meaning yet these in the last analysis embrace the ultimate significance of the universe to each living man butler rejection of science as a means of understanding the emotional phases of human behavior hinges of course upon his definition of the term science if he conceives of science as the application of rigidly mechanistic and so called objective observational procedures his frankly skeptical contention is probably partially justified this loes not however preclude the applicability to the sphere of book selection and reading behavior of other methods in endeavors directed at exploring understanding explaining predicting and controlling the subjective aspects of human behavior the symbolic interaction approach to reading belief in such a possibility comprises the heart of the symbolic interactionists position let us now examine how they would proceed to study reading behavior and what their aims of research in this field would be they would begin their investigation not with a consideration of stimuli but with an identification through observation or inference of specific types  pierce butler an introduction to library science chicago university of chicago press  p xii

 the library quarterly action approach on the other hand possesses a high degree of validity coupled with a low degree of reliability the point to be emphasized is that the deficiencies connected with either approach cannot be met by resorting to the alternative approach since the alternative approach can be used only after the problem has been restated it is therefore strictly speaking not the same problem at all to which the alternative methodological approach is applied in order to make this important point as clear as possible let us give an illustration suppose we wish to study the formation of left wing attitudes within the stimulus response scheme we should try to identify the stimuli such as radical books short wave broadcasts movies mass meetings that may be presumed to have contributed to the production of left wing attitudes a preliminary survey of possible stimuli would provide us with certain hunches as to the relative effectiveness of the different objects to which different individuals might be exposed verification of these hunches would require as was previously indicateda controlled social experiment which could be expected to yield results of a high degree of reliability the results would show for instance the proportions of voters with given predispositions who are swayed to the right or to the left by different types of propaganda literature findings of this sort however possess a rather low degree of validity as evidence of attitude formation because the experiment would indicate no more than relative changes of distribution within a given group and would not inform us as to why those voters who underwent an attitudinal change did so or why those whose attitudes remained constant did not undergo any changes instead of teaching us something about attitude formation our findings would indicate by means of coefficients of correlation only general tendencies of group redistribution after exposure to given propaganda stimuli and such redistributions would be explained exclusively in terms of distributions of relevant pre see above p i

 the library quarterly different conditions in the future it seems equally unlikely that we can draw reliable inferences about the behavior of other individuals from our detailed knowledge of the factors at work in a unique case even a large accumulation of comparable case studies would not enable us to formulate generalizations concerning attitude formation which would possess an acceptable degree of reliability acceptable that is to the investigators following the stimulus response approach the point to be stressed however at this stage of the argument is that a recourse to the stimulus response scheme would certainly not succeed in increasing the reliability of generalizations concerning individual behavior it seems that the deficiencies of the symbolic interaction approach cannot be met by resorting to the stimulus response approach and vice versa it is with these reservations in mind that we must view the following optimistic assertion of waples the variety of  effects recorded in the case studies appears almost limitless as against the halting precision of the group studies one cannot examine the results of both types of study and escape the conviction that their effective combination in future investigations would greatly enrich the results the same view has been expressed more recently by stouffer no detailed comments are needed about the important contribution of the case study procedure as a fruitful source of new ideas which can be eventually set up as hypotheses for explicit statistical checking few statisticians if any will dispute that function of the case study  the statistician and the case study investigator can make mutual gains if they will quit quarreling with each other and begin borrowing from each other on the methodological side the conflict between the statistician and the case study investigator corresponds to that between the stimulus response and the symbolic interaction ap waples et al op cit p i   s a stouffer notes on the case study and the unique case in paul horst et a the prediction of personal adjustment new york social science research council  pp   a full discussion of the differences between the accuracy of actuarial predictions and the accuracy of case study predictions will be found in paul wallin the prediction of individual behavior from case studies in horst et al op cit pp  
the social psychology of reading  proaches in social psychology however it is basically not merely a conflict between different techniques because the conflict can be traced to differences in the investigators conceptions of human nature of social living and of personality there are undoubtedly many phases of life in which little more than a stimulus a nerve current and a response are involved whenever reading consists of such a simple reflex activity it seems quite legitimate to conduct one investigations within the statistician framework but when reading is viewed as a link in a long chain of events it cannot be adequately understood without a knowledge of the complex pattern of individual motives aspirations frustrations inhibitions etc hence the case study technique has to be resorted to whenever reading behavior is to be explained in terms of these dynamic factors waples and stouffer are justified in believing that the two approaches can derive mutual gains if they borrow from each other but with reference to the solution of a specific problem or the testing of a specific hypothesis the two approaches do not seem to be capable of illuminating each other very much because a problem or hypothesis has to be completely reformulated before the alternative approach can be applied reuter seems to be correct in asserting that even though most investigators are not aware of it the differences  between the two present day schools of social psychology are fundamental and apparently irreconcilable l those following the stimulus response approach the social psychology of reading presents a rich and fruitful field of investigation especially in the area of mass communications whereas those who consistently operate within the logical framework of the symbolic interaction approach might go so far as to question or even deny the justifiability of a social psychology of reading as a separate line of academic specialization since reading would be of interest only as an incidental activity within the total pattern of human behavior which general social psychology studies the one element which these two approaches do have in so reuter op cit p 
 the library qujrterly common is their ultimate aim namely to supply instruments of prediction and control the extent to which either of these approaches is successful in the attainment of this aim determines its usefulness and legitimacy if it is possible as it frequently seems to be to predict distributions of human behavior and attitudes without making explicit reference to the character of the subjective experiences involveds the stimulus response approach deserves serious consideration similarly the symbolicinteraction approach must not be neglected as long as we find that a fuller comprehension of the subjective phases of experience enables us to predict individual and collective behavior more efficiently than without such knowledge in this sense the two approaches to the social psychology of reading are complementary rather than contradictory both should be used wherever they are applicable s the most convincing proof of this possibility is presented by the success of public opinion polls within the social psychology of reading the first step in this direction has been taken by waples and tyler op cit
