 the library quarterly community melding information distribution and human interaction it is this sense of community much more than the technological backbonethat gives the internet its significance as the technology has grown in its ability to support increasing numbers of nonprofessional users as opposed to the computer scientists who developed it such a community based conception of the internet as well as the specific incarnation of such a concept in a wide variety of virtual communitieshas become increasingly commonplace this technology pervades both the popular and scholarly imaginations to such an extent that it now can be seen everywhere from nationally syndicated advice columns to primers on advertising and marketing to scholarly literature in disciplines as far afield as economics sociology and composition further it has been used in educational settings to create electronically mediated courses in a wide range of fields including for example full online degree programs in schools of library and information studies lis much of the scholarly literature on virtual communities which draws upon a long tradition of definitional work in sociology philosophy and political science attempts to come to terms with what such communities might be this research typically focuses on the characteristics of communities that might give them substance and make them real or conversely focuses on those characteristics that make them virtual tharon howard  provides a useful critical overview of various approaches to defining community using this critique to frame a discussion of specific virtual communities similarly derek foster  draws on benedict anderson  important concept of imagined communities as well as the concepts of gemeinschaft and gesellschaft to explore virtual communities as potential sites for the redefinition of both the public and the private self and other and for further investigation of the ever expanding possibilities of human interaction  p  work focusing on the word virtual typically attempts to describe how communities that cannot depend on physical presence are constructed pierre levy notes that although a virtualized community is not there in the same sense that a geographically based community is assumed to be it is still guided by passions and projects conflicts and friendships  p  however because it lacks the physical dimension of a geographically based community a virtual community  for example the school of information studies at florida state university has operated a full online master degree program since fall  one of the key aspects of such a program is the creation of a virtual learning community of students who are widely dispersed geographically
virtual communities and hermeneutics  cannot simply accept its existence as a given it is rather a problematic entity which must continually forge a provisional self definition in terms of its own virtuality in other words a virtual community is a cooperative if inherently unstable experiment in what it might mean to be a community in the absence of physical proximity seen in this light the often asked question of whether virtual communities are real loses much of its pertinence just as it does for more traditional nongeographically based communities such as invisible colleges mediated by the written word and shared interests community is simply one activity that people undertake whenever and wherever they find a space whether physical or virtual within which interaction communication and work can take place the technological supports may shift but community remains taking advantage of available resources to become whatever it might be as levy puts it each new system of communication and transportation modifies  the pertinent space for human communities  p  in this sense then virtual communities can be understood as real communities which use a new system of communication or a particular mode of social interaction to sustain themselves if this is the case an attempt to understand the ways in which virtual communities function must focus particularly on that mode of interaction and on the conditions within which such interaction must take place this article explores such questions by examining both the mode of interaction textually based discourse and the conditions of distance and electronic mediation within which that interaction occurs to do so it uses the hermeneutic theories of paul ricoeur to argue that a process much like the one described by ricoeur as the mode of s if   p  is intuitively used by participants in virtual communities as a means of creating and sustaining those communities this process unfolds in an ongoing public performance of writing texts reading and interpreting those texts and making those readings and interpretations explicit through the creation of further texts all in an electronically mediated public setting accessible to all members of the community while the  it should be noted that community in a physical setting is also a problematic entity however physical proximity may lend to geographically constituted communities an appearance of interconnectedness that is at least on the surface quite different from the dispersion of a virtual community at the same time because virtual communities are linked by shared interests and a set of shared publicly visible discursive practices they may ironically be more tightly interconnected than physically defined communities in which diverse groups of individuals are drawn together by a wide range of other factors including a number of economic and geographic contingencies since a full consideration of the nature of community is beyond the scope of this article it must suffice to simply note such complexities
 the library quarterly thrust of this article is theoretical rather than empirical it does have implications for studying the ways in which interactions occur within virtual communities and for understanding the ways in which virtual communities function in practice thus although the article does not undertake an empirical analysis of specific communities it concludes with some brief suggestions for applying ricoeur theory in specific studies before turning to ricoeur theory of hermeneutics and applying that theory to an analysis of virtual communities however it is necessary to review some of the pertinent literature related to electronically and linguistically mediated interaction in geographically dispersed online environments as well as some literature on linguistic and interpretive mediation in community more broadly defined virtual communities and computer mediated communications studies research on invisible colleges and discourse communities has long explored the significance of distance and mediation in the predigital world further an important strand of research into computer mediated communication cmc focuses on the effects of such mediation specifically within electronically mediated environments much early cmc research suggested that human interaction via computers necessarily filters out the cues that support a sense of social presence such as facial expressions and body language thus decreasing true interaction and generating increased antisocial behaviors among cmc users   further such studies often concluded that this decrease in social and physical presence causes cmc users to experience a significant reduction of their awareness of themselves as socialized individuals   more recent research has called these conclusions into question and has even suggested that the level of antisocial online behavior has been greatly exaggerated  joseph walther   has further suggested that the lack of traditional physical and social cues in cmc can lead participants to form more positive images of their online interlocutors than they otherwise might walther argues further that this perception may most readily occur in online situations in which participants know they will be interacting over a long period of time where they feel the need to establish virtual friendships and to consider their role as a member of an online group walther research suggests that  for good overviews see  and 
virtual communities and hermeneutics  the lack of traditional social cues may thus be a significant factor in the formation and sustenance of virtual communities although much of the research into virtual communities tends to assume an unproblematic role for physical proximity and at least some degree of face to face interaction within geographically defined communities anderson  has argued that any community beyond the level of the smallest village is an imagined construct a mediating fiction by means of which groups of people can define themselves as being somehow connected while anderson focuses on the agency of political ideology in the construction of community others have suggested that other elements play a more fundamental mediating role anthony cohen  for example has suggested that the essential mediating concept in the construction of community is something much broader than ideology something that like language gives people the fundamental ability to express themselves and is itself constitutive not only of ideology but of thought itself cohen calls this constitutive element the symbol which provides people with the means to make meaning  and also provides them with the means to express the particular meanings which the community has for them  p  in other words communities find themselves through a system of signification and exchange allowing for the construction of shared meaning and the possibility of understanding because of the technologies that mediate them and because their primary medium of exchange is text virtual communities not only make this construction of shared meaning explicit but also make it into a public act or performance a process that occurs through public production and reception of texts like levy cohen suggests that a community mediated by such a process of exchange is a tenuous construct dependent not upon secure understanding but upon the much more problematic activity of interpretation as members of society we are all continuously engaged in the struggle to understand other people behavior what passes as understandingis often based on interpretation and the interpretation is generally accomplished by reconstructing other people behavior as if it was our own in other words by attempting to put ourselves in their shoes our minds in their bodies hence when other people use words that we use we interpret their intended meaning by assuming that it corresponds to ours sometimes it may sometimes it may not we are all then engaged continuously in interpretation  p  in cohen paradigm all communities whether they are real or virtual are irreducibly mediated by the interpretative act through which symbols actions and linguistic exchanges are filtered the meaning of a community is the aggregate of all of the individual interpretations
 the library quarterly that take place within that community and one place within a community is constituted by an ongoing metaphoric reading through which one attempts to understand what others within the community say and do what distinguishes virtual communities from others is the fact that they make such an ongoing reading explicit participants interact with each other and form their community always and specifically through the writing reading and interpreting of texts in other words virtual communities are built from textual performances that are made up of public acts of creating and publishing or posting texts that respond to and thus actively interpret earlier texts virtual communities and language the linguistic aspect of virtual communities has received considerable attention from researchers in a variety of disciplines boyd davis and jeutonne brewer describe online textual exchange as electronic discourse comprised of those two directional texts in which one person using a keyboard writes language that appears on the sender monitor and is transmitted to the monitor of a recipient  p  it has been widely accepted in the popular press and elsewhere that such electronic discourse which includes e mail web based writing and other types of online textual interaction is a unique mode of communication melding aspects of writing and speech into something similar to what katherine kveim modifying walter ong  calls secondary literacy  np perhaps the most fruitful approaches to linguistic aspects of virtual communities have attempted to evaluate discursive behavior within communities in order to ascertain those formal characteristics shared across virtual communities and other interactive online contexts such studies most often trace the discursive strategies employed by community participants in order to determine the ways in which such activity is different from other types of language use the conclusions of some of these studies suggest that there are indeed a distinct set of discursive structures behaviors and tendencies that are specific to virtual communities such characteristics include  particular verbal practices and structures to allow for ongoing exchange of information as part of the daily activities of the community   verbal gestures that suggest an acceptance of the virtual community as a site for reciprocal intertextuality   aesthetic verbal patterns used to establish rules for accepted behavior and social status   specific patterns of linguistic variation and framing of discourse     the verbal ebb and flow of flame wars    the linguistic
virtual communities and hermeneutics  structuring of difference and heterotopic discourse    patterns of linguistic dissent from dominant online narratives including verbal mechanisms for encoding obscuring or interrogating gender and race    the use of nonverbal cues such as emoticons to express emotion  and  verbal evidence of conceptual maps used to support collaboration  further susan herring  has suggested that because the characteristics of online language loosen the more formal structures of other types of linguistic behaviors they work to enhance both interactivity between participants and the willingness of those participants to engage in productive or performative language play making the online environment particularly suited to certain types of communities on the one hand most of these approaches emphasize the role of writers within communities which situates the production of meaning specifically within the creation of texts on the other hand gretchen barbatsis and her colleagues  use reception theory to emphasize the role of the consumers or readers of texts and to suggest that cyberspace is best understood as a space for performance in which ideas about meaning making itself can become embodied through performative acts of reading and writing such a concept of performative discourse suggests that online communities are more interactive involving both readers and writers than they are merely loci for acts of writing indeed richard lanham  and brenda laurel  have argued that performance and interactive play are fundamental to all types of human computer interaction in studies and descriptions of synchronous online gameand role playing environments including muds moos and mushes sherry turkle   and julian dibbell  among others have suggested that virtual communities in particular provide participants a space for the invention of new selves through social interaction  p  other studies of the performative aspects of virtual communities include  investigations of community development through gaming   the performance of humor as a mechanism for creating and playing with community wide shared meanings and social norms   the use of nicknames and pseudonyms in synchronous chat based communities   the role of language play as an inherent element of interactive digital writing  and  experiments using synchronous internet relay chat irc based communities to mount full scale dramatic performances    muds multiuser domains or multiuser dungeons moos multiuser object oriented and mushes multiuser shared hallucinations are all synchronous or real time roleplaying chat environments
 the library quarterly such an emphasis on performance and the interactive elements of virtual communities can be particularly fruitful for understanding the linguistic complexities to be found within them as can emphasis on the production of meaning through the creation and reception of texts however as noted above it is important in such analysis to consider the impact of the medium itself that is to acknowledge that whatever interaction takes place within virtual communities is always both structured by physical and in some cases temporal distance between participants and sustained by the mediation of the technologies that make them possible any analysis of virtual communities must take into account both the exchange of meaning through texts and the fact of a mediating distance between participants the mode of as if hermeneutic theory while there are many potential avenues for exploring such activities including as noted above the reception theory used by barbatsis and her coauthors  hermeneutic theory seems particularly suited since it is historically concerned with the possibility of meaning being transferred across the distances of time and space through the mediation of texts thus hermeneutics can provide both a way of analyzing the creation of meaning through the interpretation of texts and a way to account for distance and mediation in the exchange of such meaning further while hermeneutics is not specifically concerned with the performative aspects of language as such it can provide a mechanism for understanding the ways in which participants in virtual communities build their communities through interpretive acts or more accurately through interpretation made manifest in acts of writing in response to other writing as an approach hermeneutics has had wide influence in philosophy religious studies and literary theory in library and information studies however it has received limited attention daniel benediktsson  however argues that a hermeneutic approach allowed for an important corrective to what he saw as an overemphasis on empirical methodologies in lis studies while benediktsson article is not directly applicable to the concern with virtual communities here his analysis of ideas and interactions between individual social factors and objectivated ideas  p  suggests both hermeneutics potential importance for lis and its pertinence for the manifestation or objectification of interpretation in virtual communities much of the emphasis of traditional hermeneutics because of its concern with biblical texts was as john thompson puts it on the elucidation of rules for the interpretation of texts  p  such
virtual communities and hermeneutics  an approach emphasizing the validation of correct interpretations continues in the work of e donald hirsch  and others however much of the thrust of recent work in hermeneutics because it has grown out of the phenomenology of edmund husserl has been more theoretical in nature and attempts as hans georg gadamer puts it to come to terms with language as the fundamental mode of operation of our being in the world and the all embracing form of the constitution of the world  p  the most important strands of this work have been undertaken by gadamer and more recently by paul ricoeur while the two share a conception of language as a constitutive part of the world in which we live ricoeur work has had the clearest emphasis on textuality and has been the most clearly focused on the challenges of making distanciation meaningful and productive such a challenge of overcoming distance through the production and exchange of texts is at the core of virtual communities which by definition utilize texts to overcome the temporal and spatial distances between participants thus while i make some passing reference to gadamer in my discussion of hermeneutics i draw the most strongly on ricoeur work in particular and most extensively upon his book interpretation theory discourse and the surplus of meaning   which is a series of lectures ricoeur gave at texas christian university in  this set of lectures contains the most clearly applicable exposition of his hermeneutic theories much of ricoeur other writing including his earlier book the conflict of interpretations focuses on language such as that found in the bible that expressly utilizes the double meaning of symbols and thus requires a hermeneutic process leading to a transcendent and fundamentally christian uncovering of possibilities  p xxii ricoeur later book interpretation theory emphasizes everyday language use with a particular emphasis on discourse and the relationship between conversation and textuality such an approach is particularly suited to an examination of virtual communities which can only exist through ongoing textual conversations for ricoeur language is best understood through its instantiation in discourse rather than through the abstract and disembodied systems of semiotics studied by saussurean linguists  and structuralists   discourse as ricoeur conceives of it is an inherently interlocu saussurean linguistics rather than studying language as embodied in use and discourse examines the structure of the sign itself as an arbitrary structuring principle dividing it into the signifier the sound image of the sign and the signified the concept arbitrarily referred to by the signifier the classic text of saussurean linguistics is  while he acknowledges the importance of saussure ricoeur consistently positions his theories of language in opposition to saussurean linguistics ricoeur critique of the structuralist ap
 the library quarterly tory activity a dialogue between speaker and listener spoken language because both participants are physically present in the situation of interlocution  p  and because it is supplemented by available contextual cues as well as the conventions of grammar and gesture or ostensive referencehas the ability to transfer some limited understanding of the speaker experience and intended meaning to the listener as ricoeur puts it something passes from me to you something is transferred from one sphere of life to another this something is not the experience as experienced but its meaning here is the miracle the experience as experienced as lived remains private but its sense its meaning becomes public communication in this way is the overcoming of the radical non communicability of the lived experience as lived  p  ricoeur however does not conceive of discourse as an unmediated and unproblematic exchange of meaning or understanding between interlocutors as he notes my experience cannot directly become your experience  p  indeed such an assumption would obviate the necessity for a theory of hermeneutics at all rather the meaning of an interlocutory event its semantic content is a function of a complex interaction between what the speaker intends to say what the sentences as they are spoken actually say and what the listener understands the full meaning of a discourse can be thought of as a surplus something exceeding the intentions of the speaker and persisting beyond the fleeting moment of the event as ricoeur states to mean is what the speaker does but it is also what the sentence does  p  language as it is sent out into the world toward a listener escapes the speaker control and takes on a life of its own thus the act of speaking the discursive act inherently introduces a virtual distance between the speaker and what has been spoken as well as between the speaker and the listener the physical presence of speaker and listener in the situation of interlocution masks this inherent distance allowing both participants to assume an unproblematic exchange of meaning through the act of speaking written language however because it exists only through the physical mediation of text literalizes this distance between participants speaker and listener become reader and writer irreducibly separated by both space and time as ricoeur submits the human fact disappears when language takes the form of inscription through writing  p  proach to language pervades his work for some of his most direct analyses of the abstractions of this approach see the essays structure and hermeneutics the problem of double meaning as herneneutic problem and as semantic problem and structure word event all of which are included in 
virtual communities and hermeneutics  the disappearance of the human fact however does not mean that the possibility of the exchange of meaning vanishes in writing rather the inscription of language language physically embodied in an artifact that can both move through space and persist through time fulfills a potentiality that remains merely virtual in speech the act of speaking since it is a fleeting thing that leaves no physical trace remains merely contingent and thus problematic it is what is said the transferred meaning rather than the speech act itself that makes spoken language something more than a mere contingency even though the words as they are spoken fade into memory speech is transformed from a mere event into a vehicle for the aid of speaking  p  ricoeur calls this an act of intentional exteriorization or distanciation  p  this distanciation which remains only virtual and contingent and thus masked in speech becomes explicit in writing because it inscribes or fixes the aid of speaking writing becomes the full manifestation of discourse  pp   or in a pun which has a meaning not originally intended by ricoeur but is apropos to virtual communications e nunciation  p  the distanciation inherent in writing does not mean that the text is disengaged from discursive activity or that it becomes authorless or irrevocably detached from the intentions of the writer rather it remains a discourse told by somebody said by someone to someone else about something  p  the fact that text however distanciated continues to function as discourse makes interpretation necessary the authorial meaning becomes properly a dimension of the text to the extent that the author is not available for questioning when the text no longer answers then it has an author and no longer a speaker the authorial meaning is the dialectical counterpart of the verbal meaning and they have to be construed in terms of each other these concepts of author and authorial meaning raise a hermeneutical prow lem contemporaneous with that of semantic autonomy  p  ricoeur proposes a variety of methods for dealing with this hermeneutical problem which range from the genius of guessing through the logic of uncertainty and qualitative probability and the scientific character of validation   p   each of which is a valid even necessary interpretive response to the challenge of the distanciated text the specific interpretive act appropriate to a given text however is to a great extent a function of the actual makeup of the audience reading that text determining the exact nature of such an audience however is also part of the challenge presented by the text itself just as the text slips away from the control of the writer so it also lacks a specific reader rather it is by virtue of being a text available to an open ended audience addressed potentially to whoever knows how to read  p 
 the library quarterly however specific texts exist within specific social contexts which are governed by specific economic and social constraints a potential audience may be defined loosely within those constraints in addition a text is a function of the specific genre of which it is an example genres are generative devices  p  that structure texts according to certain rules and expectations of expression in other words contextual factors and generic norms place a frame around what it is possible to write or to mean in a given situation this has an impact on the reader as well a book is addressed to only a section of the public and reaches its appropriate readers through media that are themselves submitted to social rules of exclusion and admission in other words reading is a social phenomenon which obeys certain patterns and therefore suffers from certain limitations  p  texts written according to the norms of certain specific genres such as letters travel reports geographical descriptions diaries historical monographs  p  and so on mimic or restructure the contextual cues that form such a fundamental part of spoken discourse operating according to what ricoeur calls the mode of s if s if you were there  p  texts written within the norms of these genres partially mitigate not only the distanciation inherent in textual discourse but the situational contingencies of spoken discourse as well critiquing plato myth of the cave ricoeur suggests that writing far from being a mere shadow of the real world is in fact constitutive of the world as we understand it for me the world is the ensemble of references opened up by every kind of text descriptive or poetic that i have read understood and loved  p  the function of discourse then which is most fully realized through the mediation of writing is to project a world that is available for others to take up and through the interpretive act make their own the active engagement of a reader with the text through the hermeneutic process turns distance into contiguity while the distance between writer and reader can never disappear the mediation of text can according to ricoeur hermeneutic theory make such distance productive  p  through such a process the problem of textuality becomes its greatest potential hermeneutics and virtual communities ricoeur discusses the mode of s if explicitly in terms of printed texts and literary genres however the concept may be more broadly applied and like much of ricoeur work seems tailor made for the electronically mediated text based interactions of virtual communities
virtual communities and hermeneutics  indeed in his critique of plato myth of the cave although in  he could have had little if any knowledge of what were at that point only the merest glimmers of online communities ricoeur establishes a framework that almost seems a direct description of them this general spatialization of language is complete with the appearance of printing the visualization of culture begins with the dispossession of the power of the voice in the proximity of mutual presence printed texts reach man in solitude far from the ceremonies that gather the community abstract relations telecommunications in the proper sense of the word connect the scattered members of an invisible republic  pp   emphasis added such abstract relations are the primary contextual feature of virtual communities individuals wherever they may be sit at computers to read what other members of their communities have written and to write further texts in response distanced from each other in space and time community members are linked by an elaborate network of input and output devices network cards modems telephone lines and other electronic equipment virtual communities whether linked by email the world wide web usenet newsgroups or some other technical mechanism exist as textual conversations carried on through the telecommunications network in their structure then these communities depend on a genre of writing that directly mimics what ricoeur calls the situation of interlocution virtual communities in other words depend directly upon the mode of s if  and are inhabited by participants who textually converse with each other as if they were actually present within a situation of interlocution however the online environment housing virtual communities not only supports communication but is also a mechanism for the storage and retrieval of information thus while traditional communities exist in a context defined by physical structures and movement through physical space and by an assumption of presence the context of virtual communities is defined by structures of information and movement through virtual space and by an explicit distance in part because these communities exist within an amorphous information space rather than physical space their populations can be highly flexible people may freely move between many virtual communities at will once they have established access to the online world in addition they may not only move between communities but may also leave those communities altogether and gain access to other types of online information most of which is also textual and in many cases similar in content to what is found within the communities thus par see also  for an analysis of the digital genres within virtual communities
 the library quarterly ticularly on the web where movement from the texts created by community members to other texts is often as simple as a single click of the mouse communities can be highly permeable and may even be seemingly indistinguishable from other types of online information the existence of a community is in this context more a matter of the presence of texts exhibiting certain generic characteristics than any kind of physical or intellectual presence of a group of people within a specific space at a specific time in such an environment users may forage moving nomadically from community to community and from one information space to another thus although many virtual communities maintain a core group of users they are still distinguished by this sense of highly permeable boundaries and flexible populations the well for instance has a significant number of users who have been active since it began in  and many others who have been active for much of that time what remains constant within such an environment is neither a user population nor a physical locale rather a virtual community is defined by its own particular history of writing and reading a history documented by an ever growing body of textual messages created by shifting populations of writers and interpreted by shifting populations of readers the place of a text within a virtual community is therefore clearly not dependent on the presence of the writer of that text at any point in time following the act of writing itself and even that act takes place somewhere other than within the bounds of the community quite literally once a writer posts a text to a community that text travels out into a digital world from which it cannot be recalled and within which it takes on a life of its own even though virtual community discourse becomes part of an online textual world apart from its creators it typically carries with it certain generic traces of the writer virtual presence often through formalized textual marks such as user ids or signature sig files that identify the writer as the originator of the text thus texts created by participants in virtual communities are never fully autonomous or disengaged from the writer but function as the intentionally distanciated e nunciations of individual writers within the social context of a specific community indeed even more than most other types of texts which do  for an analysis of virtual communities as foraging societies see   such identifying marks as handles or userids may accurately point to the writer or in communities that allow pseudonymous or anonymous posting to a fictional construct that plays the role of the writer either semiaccurately or misleadingly the dynamics of such role playing have been extensively analyzed see for example  and  and are beyond the scope of this article
virtual communities and hermeneutics  not adopt the formal characteristics of the situation of interlocution these texts retain traces not only of their creators but make active if virtual use of what ricoeur calls ostensive referencevirtual gestures and figures of speech referring out to the listener and back to the speaker through such a process the situation of interlocution is lent both the materiality of the written word and a virtualized sense of presence  that mimics discursive speech acts i do not mean to suggest that the act of writing a text for a virtual community is an event in ricoeur sense indeed such an event is merely contingent in an interlocutory situation constituted by the transitory and vanishing  p  sound of the speaker voice the physical presence of both speaker and listener and so on by inscribing the contingencies of speech into the material performances of writing and reading the texts of a virtual community transform discourse as event the act of writing itself may be a transitory event but because it inscribes text on paper or encodes it in the persisting digital traces transmitted through the network such an act creates something that persists through time and space and fixes the aid of speaking in a specific set of letters and words a common criticism of the internet as both a communications medium and a medium for the storage and retrieval of information is that compared to the print media it is inherently unstable that is while words once printed in a book remain the same as long as the book is in existence words in the electronic domain are always subject to revision and change however from the point of view of an analysis rooted in hermeneutic theory the ability of writing to fix the aid of speaking in contrast to the purely ephemeral nature of the act of speaking remains in effect at least in asynchronous communities in addition although the texts of a virtual community can theoretically be altered or revised after the fact the writers of those texts rarely have sufficient access to the machinery on which those texts are stored to be able to edit or remove them some systems such as the well do support a writer ability to delete old texts such capability however is rare in addition as recent highly publicized legal cases have made clear in which ostensibly deleted email files have been subpoenaed digital files may well be more permanent than print on paper texts in this sense because the texts of the virtual community are explicitly dialogic and because they fix the said of such dialogue in the digitally transmitted marks of written language they can be seen as the full manifestation of discourse as ricoeur called writing itself virtual communities while bypassing  see for example  p  a comparison of the stability of printed texts compared to the destabilizing effects of electronic texts
 the library quarterly the contingencies of the situation of interlocution as a transitory event resituate the function of interlocution itself into the world of writing interlocution of course requires not only a speaker but also a listener if the writer of texts in a virtual community is similar to the speaker in a situation of interlocution the role of the reader is somewhat more ambiguous in one sense the reader of a text in a virtual community may be seen as analogous to the listener they both after all receive and interpret the message created by the speaker writer however as ricoeur states within the situation of interlocution discourse is something said by someone to someone else  p  in other words the listener in the situation of interlocution is the specific object of discourse the particular person to whom discourse is directed by the speaker a virtual community however is a public forum and the texts exchanged within it are available to anybody who can fulfill the minimum requirement of access thus each text as in print publishing has many possible readers however as noted above the potential audience of a given text may be defined loosely within the constraints and parameters of the situation within which it is produced to the extent that a virtual community is a community thus its texts are directed to other members of the community as a whole rather than to anybody and everybody however in many virtual communities even the potential number of readers available for any given message may be radically unknowable since access can be gained to the community by anybody with the proper equipment and since presence in many communities can only be ascertained by the participant willingness to create texts for other participants to read thus in virtual communities texts may be as ricoeur suggests addressed to an unknown reader and potentially to whoever knows how to read   p   thus while the roles of the writer and the text in virtual communities can be said to virtually recreate the situation of interlocution as textual discourse the role of the reader unknown and often unknowableis potentially more problematic as howard rheingold  and many others have noted however  just as private conversations in traditional communities do not take place as part of the discursive activities of the community as a whole so private e mail messages or messages using any other private one on one channels that may be available to members take place outside of the boundaries of the community they are that is invisible to members of the community who do not participate directly in them  some virtual communities it should be noted do provide ways of tracking who has visited but has not participated in other words who has lurkedbut such mechanisms rarely allow a writer to track the readership of a specific text
virtual communities and hermeneutics  virtual communities do develop a strong sense of themselves as communities something that would not be possible if they were simply aggregations of writers sending texts out to radically unknowable readers while the full potential readership for any given text remains unknowable portions of that readership are in fact well known to the writer primarily because many potential readers are also writers and are active participants or active performers in the community and while the population of a specific community may change radically over time there are at any given moment in an active community a number of people who do take part as both readers and writers and are ongoing participants while a large portion of the community may be transient this group forms even if temporarily the core and are thus highly visible to the community as a whole through the exchange of texts that is the primary activity of the community this presence of an active core of participants has important implications for the success or failure of the community while in the print world success can be measured in terms of the numbers of printed texts consumed bought checked out from libraries or otherwise obtained by readers who may never make themselves known to the writers of the texts virtual communities survive only to the extent that readers are also writers and are willing to undertake the public activity of posting texts to the community as ricoeur notes the potential universality of the reading audience can only be partially realized in a virtual community texts tend to be addressed not to the full and unknowable audience but to the visible and known members of the current core community those who are also writers and from whom there is a reasonable expectation of receiving a response and with whom there is a reasonable chance of developing an ongoing interaction this interaction through the influence of generic norms governing such matters as quoting others texts is highly self reflexive writers create texts that refer directly to other texts and thus integrate the act of reading directly into the act of writing reading becomes writing that in turn generates a new act of reading through such a recursive activity communities develop a robust sense of themselves and are able to forge an approximate but functional sense of their own populations this process of coming to know one virtual community is entirely mediated by texts and specifically by the public writing and reading of texts the presence of these texts within a context surrounded by still  many virtual communities do schedule face to face meetings of various sorts ranging from small informal gatherings of a handful of individuals to full scale conventions however such meetings remain in ricoeur terms contingent in any event the fullest meaning of a virtual community may be found in its texts and face to face interactions can be seen as supplemental to the textual experience
 the library quarterly other texts is what creates virtual communities which are made robust by the degree to which their texts provide evidence that the members of the community remain responsive to one another through the creation consumption and further creation of texts and that they continue to be good readers and that they publicly demonstrate their reading by also performing as active writers for virtual communities to function effectively they must develop a shared expectation of such responsiveness and interactivity the mediating function of texts within a virtual community therefore depends on the full development of those generic norms and expectations that serve as what ricoeur calls generative devices  p  to produce and sustain discursive performance and interaction within the community that is as noted above a virtual community as a whole engages in a particular genre of literary production this genre practiced by sufficiently large numbers of people and taking place in a virtual public setting created and mediated by electronics and by textual discourse allows participants in a virtual community to function as if they were a true community and were actively engaged in something much like interlocution but can such literary production be said to generate something that can be called community many critics have suggested that their use of electronic mediation in the place of face to face interaction means that virtual communities cannot support the human characteristics necessary for the development of either communication or human community ricoeur himself asks much the same question of texts in general is not this intentional exteriorization delivered over to material marks a kind of alienation  p  the texts of a virtual community are distinct from other types of texts insofar as they rely almost completely upon the success with which the participants can invoke the mode of s if  and use writing to mimic the interlocutory event in addition because of their place within the larger information environment of the internet as a whole these texts can be seen simply as texts in the midst of other texts undifferentiated from the overwhelming flow of information and data smog  thus the place of virtual communities in a context mediated not only by complex electronic machinery but also by a flood of other textual information can arguably add to the sense of alienation noted by critics how do virtual communities find such a strong sense of their own connectedness and of themselves as communities within such a potentially alienating context for one thing the disappearance of the human fact  p  so decried by critics is not simply a matter of electronic mediation but is as ricoeur notes inherent in text itself  see for example  
virtual communities and hermeneutics  resulting from the distanciation or intentional exteriorization through which written discourse must be carried out by accepting or perhaps more accurately by inhabiting a textually mediated distance and taking it as their own virtual communities in effect attempt to use the discursive properties of text to transform such alienation in ricoeur terms they attempt to make distanciation productive on an ongoing basis and work to transform the alienation of distance and irreducible mediation into a mechanism for community in addition the generic rules of discourse through which virtual communities interact their reliance on textual transformation of the ostensive references of spoken discourse as well as other characteristic verbal norms play a major role in this process the use of such generic practices allow virtual communities to provisionally define their own boundaries and to distinguish themselves from the flood of other texts surrounding them their collective acceptance of the nature of textual discourse what ricoeur calls the mode of s if  is the defining characteristic of their interactions and defines them as communities however ricoeur hermeneutics suggests a further reason that virtual communities not only exist but are able to exist s if they were true communities the transformation of distance into proximity the struggle to overcome potential alienation is inherently part of the act of reading and is an inescapable element of all acts of interpretation and virtual communities are above all communities of readers who are also writers who make the ongoing performances of reading and interpreting the writing of others their daily business as they write new texts for others to read and interpret empirical hermeneutics the practice of as if this article remains of necessity within the realm of the theoretical in one sense such a limitation is itself in keeping with ricoeur hermeneutics which explicitly rejects the challenge of deriving a specific methodology for testing interpretive practices  however if the claims made here that ricoeur hermeneutic theory can be used to describe the process that drives virtual communities and that the mode of s if  is central to such communities are accurate they should be accessible to empirical testing using specific virtual communities as examples what would such empirical testing look like in one sense the sheer presence of interpretive activity should be easy to demonstrate all that is required would be examples of posts to a virtual community that display clear evidence of interpretation by providing explicit read
 the library quarterly ings of earlier posts similarly the existence of specific generic writing practices within specific communities would be easy to verify through an analysis of overt textual practices such as norms for quoting earlier posts typical abbreviations turns of phrase and so on as well as more subtle practices governing things such as syntax vocabulary and acceptable content however such a simple demonstration would do little to show either the centrality of the mode of s if  within virtual communities or the ways in which such ongoing interpretive textual activities help to generate or sustain communities over time even while specific participants may come and go thus simply analyzing a sample dialogue or looking at a community at a specific moment of time would not suffice and indeed any given specific moment in the history of a virtual community may or may not provide clear evidence of the kinds of activities and practices discussed in this article which i would argue reveal themselves over time as the texts of a community aggregate what would be required for a direct application of ricoeur hermeneutics to a study of virtual communities however is a longitudinal analysis of the textual archives of one or more specific communities this analysis would combine the approaches already outlined with a series of close readings or content analyses designed to uncover those points at which interpretive acts of reading are manifested in the creation of new texts that are in turn as part of an ongoing iterative and reflexive textual performance fed back into the community for further reading and again further acts of writing a careful analysis of such practices as they persist over time could show not only the applicability of ricoeur theories to a study of virtual communities in general but could also reveal a great deal about the particularities of specific communities because interpretive activities draw on existing texts through reading and as suggested in this article manifest that reading or interpretation in new texts that serve as new reading materials for the community an analysis of such interpretive activities longitudinally would uncover the specific threads of content and discursive practice that tie a community together conclusion traditional hermeneutics attempted to account for the ways in which biblical texts could remain meaningful even though they were distant in time from their readers ricoeur work extends this analysis to include the distance he sees as inherent in all texts the human members of virtual communities because they must grapple daily with both tem
virtual communities and hermeneutics  poral and spatial distance through the mediation of both electronics and textual discourse accept both types of distance as their own and take the act of struggling with such distance as the primary activity of their world in other words virtual communities take the distance inherent in texts and in discourse itself and attempt to make it productive  p  by thus accepting distance and by undertaking an ongoing activity of textual interlocution virtual communities enact the final goal of hermeneutics they attempt to overcome distance through the reading and interpretation of texts via the creation of further texts as such they attempt to build communities through the means that are available to them and by so doing to mediate the distance between us that is inherent in our use of language to communicate as ricoeur puts it distanciation is  the dynamic counterpart of our need our interest and our effort to overcome cultural estrangement writing and reading take place in this cultural struggle reading is the pharmakon the remedy by which the meaning of text is rescued from the estrangement of distanciation and put in a new proximity a proximity which suppresses and preserves the cultural distance and includes the otherness within the ownness   p  the ongoing acts of reading interpreting and internalizing the writings of others that form the primary activity of virtual communities make up the engine that drives them and makes them into forums that whether they succeed or not attempt to connect the scattered members of an invisible republic in an electronic world  p  references  ricoeur paul interpmtation theory discourse and the surplus of meaning fort worth texas christian university press   howard tharon w a rhetoric of electronic communities greenwich conn ablex publishing corporation   foster derek community and identity in the electronic village in internet culture edited by david porter pp   new york routledge   anderson benedict imagined communities london verso   levy pierre becoming virtual reality in the digital age new york plenum trade   crane diana invisible coleges diffusion of knowledge in scientific communities chicago university of chicago press   swales john m genre analysis english in academic and research settings cambridge cambridge university press   shortjohn williams ederyn and christie bruce the social psychology of telecommunications london wiley   sproull lee and kiesler sara reducing social context cues electronic mail in organizational communication management science  november
