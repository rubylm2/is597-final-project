 journal of education for library and information science vation are gendered in ways that make them troubling ideals for lis and lis education  make a case for an approach to pedagogy that is effective appropriate to lis work and difficult to commodify there are some preliminary caveats first when we talk about the co construction of technology and gender we have to be careful to avoid essential izing this means not taking apparent differences between men and women to be timeless necessary or inevitable descriptions of the particular ways that competition innovation and labor manifest in our culture are not intended to be prescriptive they are also statistical generalizations not all men and women behave in the ways described additionally the characteristics described in this essay are not presumed to be static and stable characteristics that happen in all times all cultures and all places or for all people who are men or women rather one of the purposes of this review article is to historicize and denaturalize the concepts of competition and innovation and that includes the social configurations in which they arise this is informed by bowker and star  pragmatist insight that things perceived as real are real in their consequences p   competition i will start by examining the concept of competition we typically understand competition as a sport or game with two or more opposing forces ways of keeping score and a clear endpoint that determines when the best rival has won competition is goal driven and rule bound certain kinds of play are ruled in or out and the criteria for winning or losing are explicit this kind of competition tests the skill of players in relationship to one another sometimes competitions are between teams and sometimes between individuals and sometimes teams and individuals also compete against their own personal best the kind of competitiveness that the   alise conference theme invoked shares some things in common with games of sport two or more actors attempt to solve a problem of some kind and there are objective measurements of some sort that serve to score the outcomes which means there are also end points or measuring points unlike games which have relatively few clear and agreed on measures primarily score and agreed on end points market competitiveness has a plethora of measures the idealized measurement for market success is when the consumer chooses one product or service over another profit is the seller centric proxy measure of consumer interest in this idealization the consumer is the judge of the best product or outcome at the best price an indexical measure of competitiveness and innovation our idealized notion of competition as a generator of innovation black boxes a host of processes for competition including unfair practices externalizing costs marketing deception and deskilling hence there is no guarantee that consumers choose the best products or that the best products make it to market in the first place and best is itself such a problematic measure best for whom in what ways as these questions highlight this kind of measurement can obscure unsavory elements of competition for example the extremely low cost of food in the us is underwritten by squalid labor conditions for migrant workers in agriculture scoring market success is not really about having the objectively best product a given company might find ways to be profitable even when its product is not typically selected furthermore the competition can be won not only by creating what others haven but also by stopping them from creating in other words competition is no guarantor of creating new innovations or knowledge like a game market competitions have winners and losers this kind of competition is figured as a zero sum game in
gendered narratives of innovation through competition  addition to the market rationale embedded in the concept of competition there is another register of the term which is an evolutionary one with individualistic and social darwinist overtones the term evolution is often used in an unscientific teleologica way we might describe an individual as highly evolved when we mean more intelligent ethical spiritual or rational but evolution is value neutral and non teleological there is no guarantee that culturally important qualities will be the outcome of evolutionary processes evolution fits organisms to their environments if competition for resources and reproductive competition pressures require more stupid and less attractive organisms then more stupid and less attractive organisms will be the winners of the game innovation innovation is no less loaded a term innovation means making again renewing or the making of something new in contemporary us culture we often take for granted the assumption that competition assuredly produces novel solutions to professional and social challenges that will be tested on the playing fields that we call markets like competition innovation is a word laden with cultural meanings and in the current context innovation implies technological outcomes and the changes that come with them this invocation of innovation is a form of wishful thinking that aims to bring about the desired transformations without the associated costs in time and human effort suchman  bishop  p  but of course it is not necessarily new technological products being innovated but new processes or technologies for creating or packaging other products or services this is not always beneficial as sts scholar judy wajcman  demonstrates capitalism continuously applies new technology designed to fragment and deskill labor so that labor becomes cheaper and subject to greater control p   so while one important register of innovation is the marketing of consumer technologies or using technologies in clever new ways very often what is being created are processes that reduce corporate costs and increase corporate profitability these innovations are by definition new but not necessarily better for example when the compositor linotype keyboard was replaced with a typewriter style qwerty keyboard a complex male dominated field was reduced to a steno pool which enabled women to compete for these now lower paying jobs cockburn  another concern with the concept of innovation in relation to competitiveness is the degree to which new products and services are necessary or rational or the degree to which they present truly novel solutions to problems as suchman and bishop  argue  nnovation can be understood as a construct activated in the service of what is on closer inspection a fundamentally conservative in the sense of reproduction of existing orders project p  so much of marketing new products is about rendering older but functional versions of commodities obsolete sometimes this means merely repackaging an older product the new and improved label on a box of detergent is a modern marketing clich√© sometimes obsolescence is created through minor redesigns of consumer commodities one novelty of the cell phone age is the purportedly free phone that comes with a two year service contract of course the phone isn free the costs are built into the contract but every two years customers will cast off old phones in order to receive the maximum benefit from the service contract that they would renew anyway this sells more mobile phones of course but has important undesirable consequences for human rights global trade in rare metals and toxic waste disposal as this establishes competition and markets are not value neutral and innovation can produce damaging products or techniques just as well as it produces help
 journal of education for library and information science ful ones this leads to one of the problems with the cult of innovation and that is its relationship to technological determinism and optimism the belief that the present social arrangements and technologies were the inevitable byproducts of historical development and that any problems entailed in our technologies and their production processes can be eliminated with further technological innovations as sally wyatt  argues one of the most misleading and dangerous aspects of technological determinism is its equation of technological change with progress p  but as wyatt and many other sociologists of technology argue this view leaves no space for human choice or intervention and moreover absolves us from responsibility for the technologies we make and use wyatt  p  i will return to this point shortly competition and technology are gendered not only are competitiveness and innovation not neutral or innocent concepts in the ways discussed above but they are also gendered both sport and business  the two fields most obviously oriented around competition  are male dominated fields competitiveness and the technological savvy implicit in innovation are themselves markers of contemporary masculinity again this is not an essentialist claim but a description of the current social configuration as wajcman  puts it the enduring force of the identification between technology and manliness is not an inherent biological sex difference it is instead the result of the historical and cultural construction of gender p  or to put it melvil dewey  way the boys have been trading jack knives and developing the business bumps while the girls were absorbed with their dolls p  dewey however misogynist seems to understand that gender is historically situated and performative this gendering has high stakes for library science as we know from empirical studies women in our current social configuration prefer not to compete although this is well established in the sociological literature niederle and vesterlund  research offers more insight into the situation in their experiments they controlled for skill level while offering the choice to be rewarded by task or by tournament performance women chose competition half as frequently as men even when skill and risk aversion were controlled matched by skill men were more likely to be overconfident in their performance than were women as niederle and vesterlund  argue the fewer women who compete for jobs and promotions the fewer there will be in these environments although there are multiple explanations for women reluctance to enter competition environments anticipated discrimination may be a factor in this preference stereotype threat is a related phenomenon when people in marginalized groups are tested on characteristics that invoke negative stereotypes they perform worse than when the challenge is presented in a way that avoids reference to negative stereotypes for example when primed with the idea that women perform less well than men on computer tasks women are more likely to blame themselves than a computer failure for lack of success koch muller  sieverding  implications for library and information science and lis education competition is clearly gendered i will recount only a few instances from the immense literature in sociology of technology that surfaces women long engagement with information and computing technologies icts a big part of the problem is that women technological labor is culturally invisible katie king nd in her research on writing technologies argues that when technologies are reduced to singular stable self contained

 journal of education for library and information science questions that will be amenable to solving through competition competition requires measures and endpoints at which to measure problems that cannot be conceptualized in this way or which involve holistic qualitative solutions will be at a disadvantage for selection if competition is the motor of innovation then competitive work risks being about novel ways to turn a profit or increase market efficiencies rather than novel solutions to actual social problems when competition and innovation are linked then profit generating solutions to social problems will be the ones that win whether they are best or not for example though malaria has long killed far more people than aids it hasn been given very much attention because the people who are at risk are unable to pay for vaccines or cures malaria has been a third world problem only since one of the world richest entrepreneurs bill gates decided to fund research has this dire issue been given due attention so when we use competition as a tool to produce innovation we must ask what kinds of problems are likely to attract the attention of people who thrive in competitive environments and what kinds of solutions will be considered acceptable and successful the second problem for library science is the perspective from which problems are identified and solutions generated the presumption is that problems identified through competition and tested in markets are of universal interest and common good yet power differentiated groups are less able to participate in the measurement of their success ie in the marketplace and the research questions selected on behalf of marginalized groups may not be problems they would choose to study were they to design the research program this leaves crucial questions what kinds of innovation can we expect to emerge from competitive environments given the kinds of actors who are drawn to them and who succeed in them what problems will be selected for research and development given that competitiveness valorizes certain values and points of view while excising others for example cowan  shows that the development of new household technologies did not free women from the domestic sphere rather it allowed women to enter the paid labor force while leaving the gendered division of labor in the home untouched domestic technologies developed by those who do not use them as cowan shows actually entailed new levels and expectations of work paradoxically extending women work inside the home in her study of early electrical communication marvin  argues that men    wanted control of all communication conducted through the technology that belonged to them rules of expertise that invested the knowledgeable with power over the less knowledgeable transformed stories of women electrical ineptitude into homilies that justified men control of women communication p  nevertheless martin  notes that women use of the phone did not align with the male designers intentions for it p  co opting it for their own purposes women shaped the conventions for use of this early technology p     this is instructive to a techno centric field that often seems to believe that women are afraid of technology its own history to the contrary creativity and autonomy and sources of innovation i now want to return to an earlier claim i made about technological determinism and that is in relation to the presumed link between competition and innovation it is the dogma of the current age that innovation arises from competition however a body of research over the last  years levies a strong argument against this belief the now large literature of self determination theory convincingly demonstrates that the kinds of reward systems used to cultivate competitive environments actually take a toll on the kinds of creativity needed to develop novel solutions to prob
