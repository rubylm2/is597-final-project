the libay quarterly volume xxiv july  number trihe paper bound booik twentieth century publishing phenomenon kurt enoch t oday the inexpensive paper bound book is the most widely discussed phenomenon of publishing it is attacked as a threat to hard cover publishing and a miienace to mnorals or praised as a revrolutionary cultural technique that brings books to a new audience of millions who could not buy them before everyone agrees that paperbound books exert a dynamic influence on contemporary almlerican publishing yet despite the discussion that these ubiquitous volunes have inspired there has been relatively little thoughtful evaluation of the economic organization the editorial problems and the social role of paper bound publishing the inexpensive book in paper binding has a long and honorable history both in europe and in tlhe united states in pre world war ii europe paper bound books fell into three broad categories of reprints in english in domestic languages and in local language editions of public domain titles the best known of the english language reprints were the tauchilitz editions the albatross modern continental library both with sales restricted to the non english speaking countries and the british penguin books the famous tauchnitz editions founded in  in leipzig contained over  english language titles of american and british authors licensed for reprint on a royalty basis priced at the equivalent of about  cents this was probably the mnost comnplete selection of the classics and of important contem iporary american and english literature available in uniformn editions published under one imprint the albatross modern continental library founded in  in hamburg followed the same pattern but stressed contemporary writing and created a mnore attractive format for its series which eventually included about  titles in  albatross took over the mianagement of tauchnitz th ese two firms linking a century of continental reprint experience established the basic pattern for the modern fonrm of paperbound book publishing the albatross forinat was adopted by penguin books organized in england in  penguin quickly becamne tlhe largest and most promiinent paper bound publisher in a domestic language and began not only to 
 the library quarterly change the publishing picture in the british commonwealth its home market but quickly to penetrate the foreign book markets previously the almost exclusive domain of tauchnitz and albatross the largest prewar series of inexpensive paper bound editions of titles mainly in the public domain was reclam universal bibliothek started in germany in  it published ten titles per month in a slightly smaller size than the standard book of today the basic price of these books was  pfennig equivalent in value to today dime within fifty years the list grew to  titles statistics for this period show a sale of  million copies of the german classics  million of greek and roman classics and  million copies of philosophical literature including  copies of kant dictionaries and law texts were also very popular the best selling single title was schiller wilhelm tell part of this success stems from the close co operation between reclam and the gesellschaft fuer volksbildung society for popular education which established during approximately the same period about  libraries with  volumes and  traveling libraries with over  volumes the pattern of european paper bound book publishing changed after the war attempts to revive tauchnitz and albatross which had ceased operation during the war and to continue a number of new english language series started in neutral sweden and switzerland as substitutes for these series failed or had only limited success the english language continental editions had to yield to the less expensive and more up to to date american and english reprints exported to europe but the american inexpensive paperbound book with its format denrved from tauchnitz and albatross and a publishing pattern strongly influenced by penguin books began now to be widely adopted by european publishers for domestic language reprints soon after the war paper bound reprints hardly distinguishable from their american counterparts except for language appeared in almost every european country paper bound books have substantially as long a history in the united states as they have in europe their beginnings can be traced to the boston society for the diffusion of knowledge which was founded in  to issue in a cheap form a series of works partly original and partly selected in all the most important branches of learning this society sponsored the american library of useful knowledge which in  issued the first books in inexpensive paper editions and opened up the so called great revolution in publishing made possible by the invention and improvement of machine made paper mechanical typesetting and fast cylindrical presses a characteristic of this phase was the publication of books in the form of unbound supplements to periodicals this flowering ended in  when the post office decided to charge book postage instead of the lower newspaper rates for the transportation of these supplements and overproduction led to a serious price war the most flourishing dynamic and controversial era of paper bound book publishing in this country began with a large scale revival of the industry in the  a new impulse had come from the development of groundwood paper for book use which made it possible to exploit inexpensively the wide popular interest in english and french novels unprotected incidentally by copyright following a revival of extras pub

the paper bound book  what distinguishes it from former periods of flourishing inexpensive paper bound book publishing what is its future although a study of the paper bound book business is handicapped by the same lack of objective statistics that besets the iesearcher who investigates any area of book publishing the answers to most of these questions seem clear even though experience may vary with the policy of each publisher yet i think everyone will agree that the phenomenal growth of the industry may be ascribed to two major coriditions the rapid technical advances in mass production of books and the marriage of book publishing and magazine distribution paper back books are printed on highspeed magazine presses and more recently on huge new special book presses printing from rubber plates at the rate of  impressions of  pages or  copies of a  page book per hour so called perfect binding machines which eliminate the expensive process of sewing have been adapted for the binding of paper books and can turn out approximately  copies per hour new types of glue have made this type of binding almost as strong although not so permanent as the conventional fonn new developments in materials have improved the glossy dustrepellent and even washable protection for the paper covers these technical advances in inexpensive mass production however would have been useless without the vehicle of magazine distribution which makes possible the immediate marketing of the huge quantities of every new title magazines many newspapers and paperbound books in this country are distributed either through a network of approximately  independent wholesalers or by the american news company with its  branches both supply more than  retail dealers in the united states and canada most of whom carry books as only one of many other commodities or services the books are displayed in racks provided by the publisher and wholesaler it is estimated that the average dealer has rack s containing approximately one hundred pockets holding   copies per pocket resulting in slightly less than  million pockets with a total capacity for the display of from  to  million books or an average capacity of   books per dealer at any one time the books are delivered to the dealer by truck or in certain sparsely populated areas by mail the racks are filled and refilled by the wholesaler personnel frequently supported by special field representatives of the publishers themselves almost every week sometimes even more often new releases reach the dealer and older or less salable titles are returned to the wholesaler since the books are supplied on a fully returnable or exchangeable basis it is possible to use practically any retail outlet for books because no special knowledge of books and only a very small if any financial investment is required this system removes important obstacles which the hard cover publisher has to overcome to reach his audience not only can almost anyone who wants to buy a book find a good variety of reading matter within walking distance of his home or place of work but he can purchase a book when and where he shops for groceries cigarettes drugs or stationery because paper bound book outlets are self service operations the often reported awe of the unfamiliar atmosphere of a bookstore does not dis
 the library quarterly courage the uninitiated from browsing as a result of this direct exposure to books many have made their first voluntary book purchase and this wide distribution has become an important factor in expanding the book audience and developing book reading habits nevertheless this system is not perfect newspapers and magazines are perishable they are released on a certain day on sale for a limited period and returned to the publisher or destroyed if not sold when the new issues appear books are different their natural lifetime is limited only by their reader interest and not by the release date of a new title consequently books require longer display than magazines do each book has its own appeal and with the exception of the few works of generally known authors a new title cannot count on the same kind of automatic acceptance that each new issue of an established magazine can it has to be introduced to the potential reader from scratch these requirements are difficult to reconcile with existing conditions of newsstand distribution it is natural that wholesalers are tempted to treat books and magazines alike although their business volume on paper bound books is substantial it amounts to only approximately  per cent of their total volume and the economics of their operation makes them prefer bigness to specialization every month wholesalers receive from their publishers an allotment of approximately  new titles for distribution to their dealers this multitude of titles makes it difficult to devote attention to specific books the average retail dealer major book activity is to provide the space for the display racks because he generally is unfamiliar with the titles that are displayed in those racks he cannot be expected to do an active selling job display space is limited and older or slower selling titles regardless of their permanent value have to yield prematurely to faster selling new releases this makes it extremely difficult to provide permanent display for the so called long pull titles of fiction and particularly of nonfiction the result is that frequently the customer looking for specific titles cannot find them and that the publisher has to rely heavily on impulse rather than on selective buying these problems are under continuous scrutiny and solutions are being tried and developed in many directions currently strong efforts are being directed toward increasing the number of dealers substituting better dealers for unsatisfactory ones and steadily improving and enlarging the display obsolete equipment is replaced by new types of racks that require less floor space for more display pockets the cost of this equipment originally totally or partially charged to the dealers is now underwritten by the publishers or wholesalers several million dollars have been invested in such equipment since the end of the war the display itself is being segregated according to publishers imprints permitting easier recognition by the public as well as more efficient check ups title identification and reorder service by those in charge of servicing these display racks separate display units are installed for special categories of books like new american library nonfiction mentor books or pocket books library of great art to attract the substantial audience of readers with special reading interests but previously not aware of the availability of such books important titles are highlighted by point of sale promotion such as rack cards and posters attached to the display or by smaller
the paper bound book  display units which can be placed in other locations of the dealer store more and more wholesalers are organizing book departments separate from their magazine operation with trained personnel familiar with titles and authors they operate special book trucks carrying a well assorted stock of books and manned by so called bookmen who regularly check the dealers racks rearrange the display and replace lagging titles with faster selling books or new issues more and more detailed records are being kept by the wholesalers disclosing the sales and return activity of each dealer and providing other valuable information which helps wholesaler and publisher to establish better controls over distribution and supply side by side with these operational refinements goes the constant penetration into new types of outlets along with magazines paper bound books are moving into new and untapped retail facilities but their distribution also expands independently from magazines increasingly bookstores and department stores originally disinclined to handle paper bound books because of their low price have been convinced that these books not only are profitable but also are very potent traffic builders college bookstores find them a good supplement to textbooks and lately expenments with special stores handling nothing but paper bound books and carrying every new or old title of interest seem to be successful in such cities as new york detroit and san francisco these developments are encouraging but thus far mainly benefit the most widely popular books their effectiveness is more uncertain for the adaptation of mass distribution methods to the slow but permanent long pull titles or titles with a selective or thinly spread audience without the possibility of large printings many desirable and important books in those categories would have to remain excluded from the lists of paperbound book publishers a solution has to be found without resort to the expensive promotion methods of the traditional hard cover edition which would defeat the basic low cost low price objective of paper bound books it is also necessary to find means of salvaging the substantial numbers of still perfectly salable and useful books which had to yield their display space prematurely to new or faster moving titles victims of the fast turnover requirements of mass distribution to achieve this supplementary distribution and promotional activities have steadily gained in importance by increased publicity the publishers try to widen their audience and to increase its density they seek the co operation of organizations and groups that will promote and purchase books of special interest they recognize the value of better bibliographical material and more information for potential users as to the existence and the sources of supply of such books the serious publishers have become fully aware of the large potentialities of library college school and adult education use of paper bound books and are making great efforts to serve their needs increasingly the library profession has experimented with the use of paper bound books in spite of their physical shortcomings many college and university libraries have used paper bound books to help solve their reserve problems and to develop an interest in nonassigned reading and student book collecting some public libraries are utilizing these books for circulation or adult education programs

tihe paper bound book  however be of only limited value in the practical publishing situation particularly since the information is necessarily after the fact in our own experience we have found that there is no clear parallel between the sales picture of hard cover best sellers or book club selections and that of paperbound reprint editions of the same books that is really not so surprising as it might appear at first glance the status of a best seller is not necessarily determined by merit it can be pumped up by advertising it may reflect a special appeal to a particular section of the audience or in the case of book clubs its wide distribution may be secured through pressure on a more or less assured audience the paper bound book competes in a market place strikingly free of these influences is rarely advertised and seldom reviewed of course there are many books which have become best sellers because of their genuine appeal and in these cases the reprint edition has greatly benefited from the already established reputation of the onginal hard cover edition movies have been of help only in cases where an exceptionally good film coincided wth the availability of an exceptionally good or widely accepted book on which it was based typical examples are moulin rouge from here to eternity a streetcar namted desire the cruel sea duel in the sun etc all this indicates that the paper bound book publisher in his selection of titles depends on the yardsticks used by the regular trade publisher his own taste judgment flair courage and experience plus assiduous reading selecting the best books for a wide audience is as demanding a chore for the reprint editor as the trade editor hunt for the right original manuscript in our own finn for example our editors read about  books a year galleys advance copies out ofprint copies and foreign editions in order to select the  odd titles we will ultimately reprint however a paperbound book publisher is not completely free in developing his program according to his liking the great majority of paper books are reprints of hard cover editions for which the original publisher alone or jointly with the author or agent controls the decision as to whether and when a paper bound edition will be authorized furthermore there is stiff competition between the various reprint houses and more often than not the reprint rights are awarded to the bidder of the highest royalty guarantee in addition the supply of suitable new titles at least in the fiction categoryis limited and the number of useful back list titles is more or less exhausted this situation has had several important effects on the positive side it has become an incentive to widen editorial scope it has stimulated expansion into new fields such as anthologies reference books and other nonfiction also on the positive side it has been an incentive to bring back to the market through reissues good books which at one time or another had their day in mass circulation but for which a new audience has developed this periodic reappearance of good titles has done much to alleviate the limitations in time and space imposed by the mechanism of mass distribution on the negative side the limited supply has increased the temptation to publish titles which were not deemed desirable when there was an abundance of material or which were rejected by the older of better supplied houses most of which have no part in such process of downgrading nevertheless even that is not entirely without virtue as free
 the library quarterly man lewis in his bowker lecture in  pointed out the capacity for enjoying books has almost as many levels as there are readers and any publisher professing to distribute books to the bulk of our population would be thoroughly remiss in his duty if he did not try to provide titles which would give pleasure to as many levels of reading taste as possible furthermore any improvement in reading taste must have a place of beginning and that place can never be the top because of the existence of low priced books many people are now reading some books who never read books before many other people are reading more books than they ever read before the result at all levels is beneficial and germinant another consequence of the limitation of titles available or obtainable for reprint is an increase in the number of originals published in paper bound editions in  it is estimated that  per cent of the titles on the lists of ten reprint publishers were originals and two firms organized to publish only paperbound originals turned out  titles between them do paper bound originals threaten the traditional form of hard cover publishing so far the majority of titles are light fiction and it is quite possible that here the original paper bounds will indeed cut in on the sales of hard cover editions but it is unlikely that a similar trend will develop in the area of more serious fiction the editorial investment is substantial and it is doubtful whether the same reviewing space would be available for original paper bound editions without the advertising support that hard cover publishers give their publications it would be impossible to fit these additional costs into the budgetary structure of the paper bound book without increasing its price nor would the rather perishable format of paper bound originals wholly satisfy the requirements of libraries schools and private collections one might of course think that these problems could be solved if paper bound book publishers would themselves issue hard cover editions or hard cover publishers paper editions examples of both cases exist but they are far too few to permit any reliable conclusion the success of a few titles published in that fashion is no yardstick it would rather seem that such practices might lead to a far reaching diffusion of paper bound production that would risk the loss of the advantages of the present method of distribution moreover the natural reluctance of an original publisher to release reprint rights to one who is his competitor in original publishing would restrict the dual edition activity of hardcover or paper bound houses more or less to their own properties and impede a well planned publishing program with free access to a wide literary market place the situation is somewhat different in the field of nonfiction most serious nonfiction titles have greater permanence than does average fiction they represent the bulk of the back lists which are one of the most important assets of hardcover publishing houses therefore the hard cover publisher of nonfiction is particularly sensitive to the risk that an inexpensive paper bound edition might harm the sale of the original furthermore many nonfiction titles although their topics are of wide interest are written in a style unsuitable for a very wide audience or are too costly to reproduce at a low price on the other hand it is less expensive to assign specific nonfiction projects to selected authors or editors than to maintain the substantial  freeman lewis paper bound books in america sixteenth bowker memorial lecture new york public library  pp  
the paper bound book  editorial department required for a competent original fiction publishing activity these factors create both a greater need and a greater opportunity for original production by the paper bound book publisher here however a new pattern of co operation between the hard cover and paper bound book publisher seems to develop the majority of nonfiction titles originated on the initiative of paper bound book publishers for the specific requirements of the mass market are published jointly with a hard cover publisher sometimes before sometimes simultaneously withthe release in paper the hard cover publisher sales of such titles do not conflict with the paper bound edition since less than  per cent of their customers overlap and of this number many outlets such as libraries or schools prefer more durable binding this practice results in production savings when the trade publisher uses the composition or printing plates of the paper bound edition such joint editions maintain the reprint pattern although the procedure itself is reversed because of all this there are strong indications that editorially paper bound book publishing cannot and will not become a substitute for hard cover publishing although it might become predominant in certain limited areas but will the paper backs cut in on the sales of hard cover books this has long been a controversial issue only an industry wide study would give a fairly conclusive answer a sampling of cases of about a dozen fiction and nonfiction titles which we had an opportunity to check with original publishers disclosed no adverse effects on the continued sales of their hard cover editions after the release of our reprints and in some cases their sales increased it is also indicative that very often those titles which produced record sales in reprint forn had only moderate or average sales as originals furthermore evaluating a statistical survey of hard cover and paper bound sales during recent years robert w frase concluded in his windsor lecture in  these general statistics would seem to indicate that this vast paper bound output has had relatively little over all effect on hardbound original publishing which has continued to inch ahead in total number of copies during the post war period these two types of books may be serving two fairly distinct and separate markets and may not be in direct competition except perhaps in the field of mysteries and westerns and light fiction in other words the paper bound books may be attracting new book readers perhaps from the much larger category of magazine readers if one considers also the fact that hardcover books are distributed through approximately only  outlets compared with  paper bound outlets these observations suggest that the continued development of paper bound book publishing will largely supplement hardcover publishing and that mutually beneficial co operation of the two branches will increase another factor influencing the over all picture is the author royalty the standard royalty rate paid by the paperbound book publisher on  cent books is  cent per copy on the first  copies and h cents thereafter on higher priced editions these rates are increased proportionately with very few exceptions however a minimum guarantee is paid against these royalties regardless of whether eamed by sales or not these royalties in case of reprints shared  h k guinzburg r w frase and t waller books and the mass market urbana university of illinois press  p 
 the library quarterly usually   by the original publisher and the author have become a very important source of income for the hardcover publishers and offer many authors the key to the freedom of writing unharassed by the pressure of finding other ways of livelihood competition for titles however has often driven the royalty guaranty to levels substantially exceeding the amounts earned by sales royalties earned by the average sale of  copies of a mystery western or average novel amount to  yet guaranties of  for such titles have been more the rule than the exception for more important properties the figures are much higher that does not mean that in certain cases royalty guaranties exceeding the average earnings are not justified and do not remain in the realm of economic reason the big books obviously have larger than average sales potential and there are cases where a paper bound publisher is willing to pay such guaranties in order to obtain a title which would fill a vital gap in his editorial program but generally a guaranty of royalties in excess of those earned is economically unsound the margin for royalties in the cost breakdown of low price books cannot be widened any more than can the margins for the cost of paper printing binding and other cost factors without affecting the low retail price the cornerstone of inexpensive paper bound book publishing moreover this margin is not a fixed one it is narrowed in various degrees by returns of unsold books which often play havoc with the cost structure a fact easily overlooked by those who try to make a case for a larger share it should also be noted that the higher royalty rates offered in a recently widely discussed scheme of simnultaneous hardbound and paper bound book publishing are not made possible by a new magic forrmula but by an increase of retail prices above the levels which yield the customary royalty rates  cents instead of  cents or  cents instead of  cents in my opinion this device of overpricing reduces the sales potential of the books and therefore tends to limit rather than increase the total royalty income based on sales i have spoken thus far as it were from inside the industry endeavoring to show the operations and the problems of the paper bound field as they appear to a publisher i should like now to venture a few remarks from as detached a point of view as i can achieve about the social functions of inexpensive books we would all i believe recognize that books fulfil certain cultural and educational purposes of society not readily served by any other medium this has been in part because of so simple a quality as length it is possible in a book to deal extensively thoughtfully and in detail with complex ideas and bodies of fact in part it has been because books afford an unusually effective voice for diversity with the thousands of titles annually appearing providing a vehicle for every point of view and every form of cultural expression in part it has been because books have been freer than any other medium from legal and economic pressures toward conformity of manner or of viewpoint in a word the peculiar services of the book to society have seemed to derive from the fact that it has not been a mass medium we now seek to make it one it seems to me altogether necessary that we do so as the problems of society become more complex and a wider segment of the population becomes more really in
the paper bound book  volved in their solution it is no longer safe or indeed possible for the sort of diverse communication in depth afforded by books to be confined to an elite a democracy today cannot be well governed by a people whose insight into contemporary problems and their background is derived solely from newspapers and broadcasts nor can it be spiritually whole if it does not have bonds of union growing from such a common experience of the fundamental meaning of western civilization as can be conveyed only in books yet we have seen other media as they have been extended by modem technology suffer distortion and depreciation of meaning that happens to drama as it reaches the film or the television screen the short story as it reachies the mass circulation magazines the lecture as it reaches the loud speaker all are likely to suffer from vulgarization uniformity and timidity by vulgarization i mean the sort of depreciation of quality that anses from the conviction sometimes held that the mass audience is of low intelligence and cheap taste by uniformity the stale sameness that comes from the illusion that there is but one mass audience to which there is but one successful formula of appeal timidity is a special problem our society allows a wide range of unrepressed expression in all those forms of communication addressed to an elite in a broadway play or a university lecture or a fivedollar book one may with little constraint express unorthodox political or social views or speak with candor in those areas of human experience such as sex race and religion in which taboos are likely to be most pervasive and most violently upheld but as any form of expression reaches out to a popular audience pressure rises against it to assure that it does not disturb or offend in these respects this is universally true one may not say into a microphone what one may utter from a soapbox movies encounter censorship not met by the legitimate stage in general the mass media confronted with the necessity of holding very large audiences in order to meet heavy costs of production or to satisfy advertisers have acquiesced in these pressures often through voluntary codes they have sought not merely to avoid obscenity but to evade the honest confrontation of many of the more sensitive and tabooridden areas of life there has been a sort of law the wider the audience the less provocative or disturbing to established ideas and taboos the medium has to be if such a conformity is to be the price of the extension of the book audience obviously there is little gain to the cause of cultural and political freedom which i believe books peculiarly serve the fundamental problem of statesmanship from the social viewpoint in the paper bound book industry is thus to achieve a mass audience while preserving the special virtues of books it will not be altogether easy i have pointed out that the assumption has not been absent from the industry that the mass audience is an inferior audience and many inexpensive books and more particularly their covers and blurbs conform to this idea unquestionably there is a sterile repetition of formulas in many westerns detective stories and historical novels but i believe it can be done one reason for this belief is that even the inexpensive book audience is not really a mass audience as compared with the size of radio or film audiences though it may take sales of  or more to make a paper bound book profitable it
 the library quarterly does not necessarily require any broader public interest to achieve such a sale through  outlets at  cents or  cents a copy than it does to achieve  to  sales through  bookstores at  a copy as i have pointed out even quite specialized books can be sold successfully in paper bound form nor is it necessary for a paper bound publisher any more than an original publisher to create a uniforn product which will retain the same audience for issue after issue each book finds its own audience and any one publisher may successfully serve quite different and even so to speak contradictory audiences with different books finally the substantial reprint publishers are like their colleagues and like librarians devoted to the book they do not publish a different product bowdlerized or with a happy ending tacked on they publish the books themselves confident in the belief that the millions who buy inexpensive books want and deserve the same books as those produced in hard covers for a more expensive market we do not believe that one must be timid in speaking to the mass of amenrcans and withhold from a larger audience that which is available to a smaller one in this of course we follow and share the faith of librarians who have found the millions they freely serve to be as eager and mature an audience as exists anywhere we have had these principles before us as we have confronted the widespread efforts to apply a special standard of censorship to inexpensive books through police intimidation and through group pressures there can be no question that a part of the provocation to this alarmingly general pressure has come from or has been helped by a needless and distasteful sensationalism and salacity on covers but the conception that covers produce censorship is not generally true actually the most serious censorship efforts have disregarded covers almost entirely and aimed directly at those works most disturbing to the censoring group this has in fact frequently tended to mean a concentration of censorship efforts on better books which have more effectively penetrated areas of sensitivity though responsible reprint publishers have taken very seriously the sometimes well founded criticism of means of promotion used in the early days of an industry highly competitive not only within itself but within the whole field of periodicals they have not been prepared to compromise on content i am glad to say that in this policy they have had the vigorous collaboration of original publishers who share the conviction that books must retail their essential indivisible character at whatever price and through whatever channels they are distributed with all its fantastic gains in sales distribution and production techniques its heavy responsibilities to trade publishers and authors its sobering moral commitments to the vast public it serves what is then the future of this adolescent industry the role of enfant terrible or wunderkind will history repeat itself are we again heading toward disaster do we not again have overproduction and price wars and too many inferior books which will make us lose our friends yes we have some of all that to a greater or lesser degree but we have many other assets which did not exist in earlier periods we offer predominantly contemporary american literature without neglecting to make available a good cross section of the best or most important foreign writing infonnative or scholarly nonfiction is steadily increas
the paper bound book  ing so is the usefulness of our books for education and enlightenment we are not the natural enemies but the natural friends of the hard cover publishers who are our main source of supply our publications are books and not only in name in spite of certain limitations in typography and durability of binding imposed by the requirements of mass production constant progress in manufacturing equipment and methods makes it possible to improve the format of our books without increasing their low price level our distribution benefits from all the advantages of the twentieth century technological progress the automobile airplane modern communications system office and warehouse mechanization etc our wholesalers operate efficient sometimes huge organizations penetrating into the smallest and farthest corners of the country we can make use of the refinements of advertising and promotion methods and of the many new modem media at their disposal we are not dependent upon or limited by special conditions such as influenced the course of events in the past but operate under the same rules and laws as the rest of the publishing fraternity therefore to the degree that inexpen sive paper bound book publishers are able to contribute to the objective of bringing books to millions at low cost without in the process sacrificing the tough independence and diversity of thought or the rich variety that books have always meant they will be participating in an encouraging and significant cultural revolution another demonstration that in a maturing america we are learning to achieve in matters of the mind and the arts as we have already achieved in the economic area the broad and general distribution of goods that are a vital factor in the dynamic expansion of a free society
