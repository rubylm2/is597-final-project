the library internship and expo as a pathway to diversity a case study curt asher and johanna olson alexander college and university libraries need to develop undergraduate internships to encourage low income and ethnic minority students to enter the library profession such internships can be run on limited budgets this article presents a case study model for an internship program and its related promotional efforts currently in place at california state university bakersfield the article discusses the need for greater ethnic diversity in libraries and the value of internships as a tool to confront minority underrepresentation in the library profession introduction colleges and universities can confront the issue of lack of diversity in the library profession by providing library internships to students from minority or economically disadvantaged backgrounds these internship programs if kept small can be run on limited budgets and can have profound effects librarians at california state university bakersfield csub developed an internship program designed to equip students with skills and experience they can carry forward into library and information science graduate programs and the professional workforce the program will broaden hispanic and other ethnic minority representation in libraries csub program is part of the minority recruitment continuum within the profession it focuses its efforts on individuals rather than groups of students and its small scale allows for an intensive undergraduate introduction to library science and in depth mentoring meanwhile across the profession there are numerous examples of minority recruitment programs that are opening doors and providing opportunities for example the american library association funded its spectrum initiative in  providing scholarships to minority students who pursue degrees in library science efforts such as the diversity internship in libraries program sponsored by the university of massachusetts boston simmons college libraries and the simmons graduate school of library and information science expose high school students to the profession through internships on a larger scale the mellon foundation two  grants to the mellon librarian recruitment program for undergraduate students at j of education for library and information science vol  no  winter  issn    association for library and information science education

 journal of education for library and information science inspiring an interest one of the american library association recent slogans aimed at promoting the information professions was the word typical within a red circle and slashed with a red line the library profession certainly is not a typical profession and in the experience of these authors one few students will select without being directed toward it our experience as academic librarians told us that our profession was widely misunderstood and rarely seen as a legitimate career option by upperclassmen in  we began seeking a means by which we could teach students and members of the community about the profession and the wide range of options available within it in the beginning our aim was simply awareness we hoped to present the profession as a career option to those who may not have considered it before and provide mentoring to those who might be considering it the plan we settled on was an information fair which we called the library and information science expo the project was extremely successful drawing  interested attendees the first year and  the second all for a base budget of less than  the largest number of attendees came from the csub student population our plan for the expo was two pronged first we wanted to introduce people to the range of career options available to people who earn a library science degree secondly we wanted to provide information about information and library science programs in california and across the nation we began by simply contacting colleagues at bakersfield community college and the kern county public library and obtained their commitment to attend the event man booths and talk about their jobs to attendees an expo committee was formed with representatives from our three institutions then by means of professional contacts and research of professional organization membership lists we began making phone calls to librarians who worked in other types of information management settings during the two expos one held in  and another in  we were able to attract in addition to academic and public librarians information professionals from archives medicine law computer systems film database companies and public schools we had people from both private industry and the public sector the librarians who took part were an ethnically as well as professionally diverse group and were enthusiastic to have an opportunity to promote their professions and talk with attendees an added benefit of the expo was the opportunity it provided for unstructured networking among librarians we also communicated with universities around the country that offered ala accredited masters degrees in information studies or library science the response from most library schools was to provide us with promotional literature some institutions have migrated entirely to the world wide web and actually had difficulty locating promotional materials in print but the majority of schools had well developed promotional packages describing their programs the two library and information science programs in cali

 journal of education for library and information science shatter myths and stereotypes and awaken individuals to the research technical and service careers in library science they may have been unaware of if the profession expects to attract people from both genders and from ethnically socially and economically diverse backgrounds these kinds of awareness programs are urgently needed in libraries particularly libraries serving ethnically diverse populations while inspiring an interest in librarianship is an important first step it is not enough libraries can nurture promising future librarians into the profession with well designed internships that prepare them for graduate school mentoring through internships there are people on every college campus who would make good librarians unfortunately many of those students choose other careers either because they face obstacles that interfere with their ability to attend a graduate program or because they have not been made aware of library science as a professional career option stiern library at csub was able to obtain funding to establish a pilot program aimed at locating students with potential for library science careers with the help of a title v developing hispanic institutions grant title v funds several programs at csub librarians lobbied and played a key role in the writing of the campus wide grant proposal to the us department of education successfully obtaining  per year to fund an internship for five years this moderate amount of seed money has reaped benefits allowing the library to begin working with undergraduate interns in january  in  an additional title v grant funded a second internship for community college transfer students since the program started csub internship mentors have worked with five interns in addition to the current intern one is currently enrolled in a library science graduate program another is scheduled to enter a program next year and a third is in graduate school and researching library and information science programs one withdrew from the internship to pursue a career in teaching this  percent success rate is impressive even though the sample is small particularly if one considers return on the fiscal investment the internships establish mentor protégé relationships roche  study of business executives found that those who had mentors were more successful in their careers equally as important was his finding that mentored executives were more likely to sponsor proteges than those who were not mentored roche describes a ripple effect in which executives who had two mentors tend to sponsor  proteges on average bonnet whose essay summarized some of the recent mentoring literature relating to libraries concludes that internships move librarians forward and are a first step toward the advancement of minorities  the benefit for novices of obtaining professional instruction and advice from veterans is obvious a
the library internship and expo as a pathway to diversity  less obvious benefit is the ripple effect because people tend to seek out others of similar backgrounds for professional advice and because those who have been mentored tend to mentor others formal undergraduate internships can help build a mentoring infrastructure through which future librarians will benefit supervising an intern requires a substantial initial investment of a mentor time but in due course the intern own interests will steadily begin to determine the direction of his or her training allowing an intern to find an area of professional interest requires flexibility on the part of the mentor this self directed approach will shape the internship and provide a richer more rewarding experience for the intern for example one intern after working with several librarians on projects discovered that she had a strong interest in original cataloging the intern worked with the bibliographic control coordinator on a large project involving the cataloging of master theses this project allowed her to gain knowledge of the often cryptic and puzzle like elements of original cataloging the work to which she devoted a great deal of her time was pleasurable and educational for her as well as valuable to the library another intern who found himself particularly interested in the technical side of digital image management helped the archivist and systems analyst design and implement a database for this purpose structure of an internship the csub internship provides training and study professional development and mentoring assigned professional projects and evaluation it begins with assigned readings in library science and an advanced introduction to library use including reference exercises the readings are selected by the mentors and are discussed with the interns at length in a classroom setting this introduction to the profession can last three to five weeks depending on the intern skills and reading interests meanwhile and throughout the course of the year librarians and managers can submit projects to the mentors these projects are reviewed by the mentors and only projects that will provide the intern with professional level experience are accepted the intern then works with a librarian and receives projectspecific training the intern will perform the job and be evaluated on the outcome of the project for examples of typical projects see figure   the projects are central to the internship because the intern is actually working with librarians either in collection development instruction reference archives technical services or systems the final key element of an internship is career development and professional exploration over the course of the internship librarians arrange trips to libraries and information centers conferences and training sessions since the program began interns and their mentors have toured facilities and networked with librarians who work in major museums state prisons space flight research institutions major metropolitan newspapers
 journal of education for library and information science figure  selected examples of intern project activities   corporations and several universities most of the interns described these tours as memorable and valuable educational experiences opening their eyes to an even wider range of opportunities in library science the interns have also attended major library conferences with their mentors where they had opportunities to meet with current students and professors in library science programs make professional contacts with librarians attend presentations and workshops and see new books and developments in technology unveiled by vendors on a broader scale career development entails professional training for library science education this training will vary depending on the interests and needs of the intern some examples might include a formal graduate record exam preparation course a writing workshop or a series of public speaking tutorials on a more practical level an intern might spend a week job shadowing at another institution finally interns are expected to research library science programs and to locate those that most closely match their needs they also research scholarship funding during the course of the program the interns are encouraged to complete applications and locate scholarship packages the mentors assist with this process during the application process librarian mentors are in unique positions among academic reference letter writers because they have actually observed the interns at work and can comment on their strengths both scholastically and in librarianship attended and observed six subject orientations including presentations for classes in english political science social work physical education and history regularly attended the csub library advisory council meetings kept log of all activities and projects regarding internship work prepared a web page for an art exhibit in the library assisted in a business collection development project assisted in the teaching of a week course  research on the internet completed a project to make electronic reserves more efficient prepared a power point presentation regarding a database located fifty scholarly websites for a subject guidepathfinder in american history helped library systems analyst implement an image database system assisted special collection librarian by locating and writing abstracts for chronological history of csub from newspaper articles assisted special collections librarian by collecting and organizing a historical collection of hispanic excellence documents
the library internship and expo as a pathway to diversity  conclusion opportunities in library science are expansive but unrecognized academic libraries can open the door to the profession by offering internships and mentoring to undergraduates the interns leave with a real understanding of librarianship and practical skills that will allow them to excel as they proceed into graduate school and the professional workforce a mentor seeks the potential for excellence in an intern that translates into a strong work ethic and enthusiasm for the work further however interns must be dedicated learners while a grade point average is certainly a telling indication of an intern potential for graduate school it is not the sole gauge of a willingness to learn or an ability to take instruction it is the mentor job to nurture the potential in an intern so that the intern is well prepared for the challenges ahead such programs need not cost a great deal of money they are however time consuming mentors must be prepared to devote a great deal of time to planning training and observing over the course of the internship as the intern develops an interest in some element of librarianship and begins to devote more energy to it the mentor may be able to reduce the time spent with the intern the aim of any internship should always be to put the educational needs of the intern first it should never be used as a substitute for staffing professional or otherwise libraries can begin to change the face of librarianship by opening up internship opportunities to people from ethnic minority or low income backgrounds a balanced profession where all people are fairly represented is the aim of most public institutions one means of beginning to build this balance into librarianship is through well managed internship programs references  andrea glick minority recruitment ala puts its money where its mouth is school library journal  no     association of college and research libraries reports from national conference programs  acrl news  no   httpvwwwalaorgalaacrlacrlpubscrlnews backissuesjunentlconfrptshtm accessed january    john n berry iii knowledge river library journal  no     jerry d saye and katherine m wisser students alise library and information science statistical report  table ii a httpilsuncedualisestudentstableii ahtm accessed july    us department of commerce fact sheet  community survey data profile highlights american fact finder kern county california united states census bureau httpfactfindercensusgov accessed july     california state university fall  enrollment by ethnicity student information  division of institutional research httpwwwcsubeduplanningethnicityhtx accessed july     denise adkins and isabel espinal he diversity mandate library journal  no
