ie visible college  about the author howard f mcginn is dean of university libraries clarion university clarion pa discipline they set moral standards they provide cultural continuity and cohesion in the community hire an fricanamerican grandmother the person of course does not have to actually be a grandmother the person should have deep roots in the community and be acknowledged as influential and important the grandmother will counsel mentor and help with many of the students adjustments to daily life the grandmother will help provide a sense of home especially during bouts of homesickness the student may experience upon arrival in the southern united states there is a large rural african american population the chances of rural institutions identifying a grandmother to work with the students should be very good institutions that are rural but located fairly close to an urban area may experience some difficulty in hiring a grandmother because of the cost of commuting this minor barrier can be overcome by increasing her salary to reflect the cost of commuting or by building a travel reimbursement clause into any agreement with the person institutions that are rural and not near an urban center may have to resort to other strategies it is this writer experience that the grandmother will eventually become a confidant for white students when this occurs a major step in creating a racially harmonious atmosphere among students and faculty will have been taken major considerations safety students will usually research your town and campus before applying or moving if there is a history of local crime steps have to be taken to counteract the students perception that the town or campus are not safe please keep in mind that present reality does not always match perception a student may perceive your city or campus to be dangerous because of anecdotal information rural folks often make the assumption that they live in total safety and are isolated from the terrible problems that they believe plague people in the cities rural areas of course have many of the same problems as the cities african americans may face unique safety problems in rural areas especially in those areas where there is not a large historic african american population usually african american students will be accepted and experience few difficulties in the town where the university is located safety problems may exist in the small towns and areas that border the university town while rural white residents in the south will not think twice about seeing an african american rural white residents in areas where there are not many african americans will notice black people immediately in most cases white residents in these areas will welcome african americans and friendships can form rapidly but there are often white supremacist organizations in rural areas surrounding the university town there will also be white residents whom while they do summer 
 journal of education for library and information science not belong to a white supremacist organization are sympathetic to the beliefs of the hate groups one special note ask the county and town police for a copy of their policy if any regarding racial profiling you need to monitor incidents where african american students may be pulled over while driving just because they are black this is a common occurrence strategies  tours  give new students a comprehensive tour of your town or city and the surrounding countryside the tour should include historic religious entertainment shopping food store medical and cultural sites include other sites that will help adjustment ask the students what they would like to see the tour should also include good and bad neighborhoods especially those near the campus a visit to typical apartments is important do not hesitate to point out neighborhoods that have a history of discrimination against minorities the best tour guide is a long time resident of the area or someone who has a good understanding of the neighborhoods and surrounding towns brag about your city or town give the students a map of the area so that they can orient themselves  update information  prepare a handout for the student that includes recent positive newspaper and magazine stories about your town or city give the student an information packet provided by the chamber of commerce transportation this is a problem every student has how do i get to the university strategy information  when recruiting new students provide information about airports amtrak stations and bus stations provide a road map in case the student chooses to drive consider picking students up at the airport when they first come to your institution in urban areas public transit is important provide a map of public transit routes if the university has its own transit system provide a map that shows service to neighborhoods childcare availability of professional affordable quality childcare is very important availability of childcare may be smart recruiting too strategies  information  provide lists of licensed day care centers near the university during the tour visit the centers introduce the student to the staff at the university day care center work with your african american grandmother in obtaining care  student help  check with the university office of student services to see if it has a list of students interested in babysitting organize a special departmental group of student babysitters this would also provide some income to the students in the group housing there are housing items that need special attention discrimination in housing is common especially in apartments legalities not withstanding sometimes african americans are charged excessive deposit payments and have difficulty obtaining phone and utility service volume  number 
the visible college  for no other reason than because they are black like many police departments apartment owners might profile african american customers in such a negative way that even if the applicant were a successful business person she or he might be denied a lease just because the person fits the profile you will probably never see a written profile it is illegal african american men have frequent problems with this practice in such normal things as service in a store getting a taxi or just driving a car strategies  identification  identify apartment owners and apartment complexes that discriminate contact african american organizations on campus the urban league the naacp there are sometimes chapters in rural areas realtor associations governmental fair housing and rent control departments the campus director of housing the better business bureau african american churches and other organizations that have knowledge of discriminatory practices compile a list of apartment facilities that have a reputation for discrimination give it to the students in like manner compile a list of facilities that have a reputation for treating african american tenants honestly and fairly distribute this list recommendations of white students might not be of much use since they would not have had problems with discrimination just because of their race  neighborhoods  neighborhoods have reputations for discrimination and hate crime incidents show students neighborhoods that are near to the campus identify those neighborhoods that have a history of discrimination learn where the student wishes to live and see if that neighborhood has a history of discriminatory problems in rural areas surrounding towns may have reputations for discrimination and hate crime incidents identify those towns that have a history of discrimination worship for most african american young people the church plays an important role in daily life the church is a place where social contacts are made where relief is sought from the strictures of general society and where spiritual nourishment takes place the church for many african americans is the anchor in a world that is often abrasive identification of places of worship also helps students to acclimate themselves to new surroundings white americans belong to a broad range of religious denominations and african americans are no different many are roman catholic many are baptist many belong to the african methodist episcopal ame church and so forth while you will probably encounter very few students who belong to the nation of islam black muslims you may recruit students who belong to more traditional islamic sects strategies  talk and meet  ask students if they are interested in visiting places of worship you won need to go yourself it would be good to become familiar with the various denominations in your city and the sites of their churches be sure to include religious centers on campus it may be difficult in rural areas to locate a church that is traditionally african american but not always in emporia kansas for example there are two churches summer 
 journal of education for library and information science that are traditionally african american st paul ame church and st james baptist church if there is no church in your town see if the student wishes to visit churches in the nearest city the campus minority student concerns organization may hold occasional religious services if you do not have an understanding of islam make arrangements to introduce the student to islamic clergy faculty and students at the university islamic center if there is one many times a neighboring university has such a center and can be of help  update information  provide lists of places of worship listed by denominational category make sure the list contains addresses telephone numbers web sites and the name of the pastor  religious practices  ask each student if she or he has special religious observances that you need to be aware of examples are dietary alcohol caffeine in soft drinks holy days and so forth most students will welcome this question because it will show that you honor their beliefs be aware that many african americans say a silent prayer before eating even in mcdonalds it is also common in the african american culture to open and close meetings of african american organizations with prayer personal care african american students will usually shop at the same stores as everyone else but certain personal care items are unique to african americans and help in locating stores should be given to new students the most unique items are hair care for men and women and make up for women strategies  hair carecosmetics  provide a list of stores and a map to enable students to begin shopping make sure that the barbershops and beauty salons listed have professional employees who are african american or ideally are owned by african americans latino barbers and hairdressers are often popular with african americans braiding is very popular many times other african american or african students braid hair in their homes check with the african american organizations on campus or with the african american sororities and fraternities for suggested names it will be helpful to provide a list of african american beauty supply shops in the neighborhoods these stores carry a wide variety of personal care products not sold in larger stores or stores that have few african american customers some lines of cosmetics eg fashion fair tightly control their franchises and can only be purchased at large apartment stores such as nordstrom or filene because this will vary from city to city call the store before you recommend stores salons and barbershops in rural areas that offer products and services to african americans are difficult to locate hair care products for women can sometimes be purchased at local beauty products stores or at national chain stores such as wal mart if the student uses fashion fair cosmetics or similar product lines the only solutions are to travel to a nearby city and obtain the products by mail or on the internet  clothing  many stores sell lines of hosiery that offer shades attractive to african american women but sometimes locating hosiery items can be volume  number
