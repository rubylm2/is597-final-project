dgu e s t e d i t o r i a ldiversity by design keren dali and nadia caidi abstract in this article we introduce the concept of diversity by design this concept is relevant to library and information science lis education professional environments and partnership based community engagements building on our experience as educators and researchers we illustrate this concept in the context of lis graduate education and invite readers to contemplate whether this concept makes sense to them and if yes how it works in their respective workplaces and communities we interrogate the term diversity bringing to light the multiplicity of contexts that give diversity meaning and life in our complex field by so doing we demonstrate that diversity broadly conceived is foundational to lis and that discounting or underappreciating its pivotal function may have a disintegrating effect on our practice scholarship and education iversity has become one of the most frequently used buzzwords in our field almost to the point that we do not often stop to ask ourselves what exactly do we mean by diversity the fact of the matter is that diversity is a multidimensional term that gets reinterpreted and redefined practically every time it is used depending on who uses it and in what context in most cases diversity refers to a wide array of community members whom we engage or to the demographic composition of the professional and academic workforce and student body or to the versatility and richness of resources and information we handle and make available diversity is also frequently framed as an issue of social justice with regard to both people and information an often noted problem however is that there is not enough diversity in the workforce and not enough representativeness in resources an often offered and rather obvious solution to both is a call for increasing the number of diverse individuals among librarians other information professionals students and faculty and for improving the variety of available information and modes of access there is no shortage of initiatives to address boththe first author listed is a corresponding author there is no principal author and both authors have equal authorship rights for the purposes of bibliographies authors can be listed in any desired order library quarterly information community policy vol  no  pp    by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
diversity by design  however despite our best efforts the state of diversity is not getting better significantly or quickly enough this brings us to the crux of the matter as the president of columbia university lee c bollinger was quoted as saying we really want to have more diverse faculty we think its good for a variety of reasons    and the fact is very little happens you have to wonder what it is that leads to that mcmurtrie  what indeed many answers can be given to this question but when all is said and done it comes down to one crucial consideration diversity remains pretty much an add on not the essence whether we talk about staff students information resources or a pool of ideas its an extra thing you add at the end mcmurtrie  quoting m b james par  in our previous publication caidi and dali  we noted a turn toward what we can call integral diversity or the idea that diversity is not a mere add on in our field but rather an inseparable part of our credo daily activities education and practice  emphasis added diversity ideas ideals and considerations we posited should be seamlessly built into our curriculum work environments decision making professional choices and interpersonal relationships in both the workplace and academia they should be there from the start not thrown in for reasons of trendiness and popularity at a moment of need they should be part of the foundation part of the core in other words they should be there by design not by chance the whole idea of building something in and integrating something into the overall design means that an element becomes indispensable removing this element will preclude the system from functioning properly it seems however that library and information science lis curricula workplace logistics and faculties are unlikely to disintegrate if diversity conversations and considerations are removed from the equation those who agree with this statement we feel may be simply unaware of how pervasive and ubiquitous diversity contexts are in lis scholarship education and practice this issue is something that our article intends to address making diversity integral and structural will not be an easy task one of the issues is a lingering mentality and the perception of diversity as a bonus and a frill one of our colleagues once shared a story of how she worked with a senior faculty member on an introductory reference course and suggested that the course coverage be expanded to involve diversity considerations beyond the  minutes in one class allocated to working with diversity users the answer she received although certainly frustrating was not entirely unexpected and not at all exceptional the senior faculty member replied that while it would be nice to have a conversation about diversity in a classroom the course was already so densely packed with essential stuff that they could hardly afford to have diversity discussions in addition she noted the topic of diversity was addressed in another class on lis foundations it is particularly alarming to consider that the comment came from a person who can be considered a designer a faculty member charged with overall course development and administration if designers do not see diversity as an essential structural and functional element there will never be diversity by design
  the library quarterlynot all examples are grim though the diversity conversation received new impetus in one of our classes in which a group of opinionated and forward looking students brought up a serious question if every librarian or information professional inevitably finds himor herself working in a diverse environment why are courses on diversity not part of the lis core curriculum every lis program realizes the vitality and ubiquity of technology and offers core technology courses despite the fact that not every lis graduate will end up in a highly technologysaturated environment at the same time practically every lis graduate will work in a diverse setting with diverse community members regardless of the type of library or information information technology it setting yet courses on diversity are not built into the core students talked about these questions passionately and at length and the discussion spilled over to other classes in the same course in the final project in which students could choose to give suggestions on curriculum improvement to their faculty administration many students noted the need to include diversity courses as a core requirement this is a very hopeful and heartening sign students interests priorities and aspirations are an important part of the curriculum design and at least in this class it was clear that diversity topped the list of educational and professional priorities in which students took keen interest and into which they put their hearts that is to say one element of diversity by designcommunity minded diversity conscious students was there the progressive student body can be relied on as a partner in diversity initiatives this is not always the case however in another class on diversity for example there was much initial reluctance by some students to engage with real life diversity issues and to get involved with community projects poor neighborhoods homeless persons in libraries the lives of immigrants and refugees access barriers in the lives of people with disabilitiesthose issues seemed too heavy for a classroom assignment students felt much more comfortable discussing diversity in broader theoretical terms and given a choice of projects defaulted to the safer options of analyzing websites or comparing policy documents this could be an indication that while hypothetically students appreciate the importance of diversity and inclusion hitting the ground running and doing the real thing is an entirely different proposition diversity can be messy unfamiliar unpleasant and uncomfortable and many students are not prepared the overall design of the course however was intended to help students get out of their shell overcome their insecurities and step into the shoes of those for whom diversity is not a topic to cover or a textbook chapter this design worked changing perceptions and attitudes at least in the small group of students who dared to venture out of their comfort zone as was shown by course evaluations and ensuing student feedback as we noted earlier our examples came from the field of lis education academia and the curriculum structure for the learning environment the elements of diversity by design are quite clear  instructors awareness of how vital diversity considerations are in the design of any course not only electives on diversity this can be done through the integration of re
diversity by design  flective readings class discussions assignments and guest talks that address both diversity dimensions and the course subject area diversity should become the mainstay of instructors vision and course planning  support from the faculty and administration for making the content of courses inclusive of diversity considerations this inclusion can culminate in the introduction of a core diversity course to the curriculum a course that is found in some lis programs but not frequently enough  students who realize the ubiquity and importance of diversity and who are willing to engage with diverse populations in class and in professional environments regardless of their own backgrounds students awareness that diversity competencies and attitudes are just as important as knowledge of technology and core professional skills will be paramount in driving the learning process  learning oriented partnerships with community groups representing diverse populations in the broadest way such partnerships open up a wide array of learning training and engagement opportunities for students and future professionals and lend mentoring and professional support  a robust network of educational resources and technological platforms that facilitate diverse learning styles  the diversity mind set which includes but is not limited to the following a a recognition that diversity is a reality of life not a problem to solve or an issue to address b an internalized belief that diversity is everybodys business and not a concern of minority groups depending on the context we are all diverse or have the potential to become diverse a broken leg and a temporary cast may prompt an otherwise healthy and able bodied person to suddenly realize how inaccessible public transit educational buildings and governmental offices may be a person who has grown up in a white middle class christian household may one day fall in love with a person of a different race religion and country of origin subsequently finding himor herself to be part of the multicultural multiracial multilingual community c a deep conviction that diversity is not an option or an add on it is integral to social structure daily interactions learning environments professional settings and human relationshipsfrom kinship to friendship to collegial engagements to serendipitous encounters with strangers d an understanding that the diversity debate should proceed from concern for specific groups to concern for the health and function of the diverse society as a whole e an ability to see the multiple contexts and expressions of diversity in our professional and academic settings
  the library quarterlythe latter ability is absolutely crucial to treating diversity as integral to the entire field of lis especially because in our eclectic and interdisciplinary field diversity can indeed be interpreted in many ways  the diversity of professional practices and research and diversity of resources and information handled in professional environments traditionally associated with collections records and artifacts the field of lis has evolved in recent years into an individualand community focused field with lis graduate education becoming increasingly studentcentered and premised on the principles of experiential learning community engagement and service orientation eg bertot sarin and percell   this trend is inextricably connected to the diversity of roles performed by information professionals and the settings in which they work not bound to libraries archives and museums information professionals find an application of their skills in governmental organizations nongovernmental organizations it companies health care mass media the entertainment industry and so on new roles include information and data analysts social media librarians community engagement and outreach workers and remote training coordinators for online resources to name just a few no longer limited to information mediation and helping individuals locate needed resources information professionals have transformed into information literacy educators community advocates online resource managers information policy makers and data curators among others with expertise ranging from library services for children to managing big data and from database engineering to museum curation it is hard to find a more diversified professional and scholarly field auckland  bertot et al  howard   the diversity of communities served in the course of their work information professionals engage with diverse communities be they geographic communities or communities of respective institutions this diversity is not limited to race ethnicity religion age gender body abilities sexual orientation or social status but also involves diverging worldviews and different opinions and perspectives which result from diverse cumulative life experiences viewed in totality these experiences amount to so called valuesbased diversity or insights that cant be taught schmidt rosenberg and eagle   and is brought by people into their professional settings as part of their individual identities economist intelligence unit  hudson ward  in the sociocultural context information professionals work with aboriginal immigrant visible minority and mainstream communities which accounts for the truly multicultural nature of lis practice and scholarship eg pyati  burke  jaeger bertot and franklin  mestre  dilevko and dali  somerville and echohawk  jaeger bertot and subramaniam  ghaddar and caidi 
diversity by design   agem diversity considerations in preservation and digitization the cultural and historical heritage information of communities of color aboriginal multilingual and immigrant communities is very complex and may involve traditional knowledge and knowledge generated and passed through oral communication practices and expressed in a multitude of languages other than english or french these types of knowledge create particular challenges in terms of collection classification and digital preservation which should be resolved to ensure the authenticity of preserved information and effective and reliable access to it eg stevens  daniel  gardiner et al  maina  roy   diversity in the workforce not only are communities engaged by librarians and information professionals diverse and eclectic but also librarians and information professionals themselves are a very diverse and eclectic group which makes the conversation about values based diversity in lis particularly relevant and significant eg warner  allard mehra and qayyam  dali and dilevko  overall  thurston  hastings   diversity in academia similarly the issue of the diverse student body and the diversity of faculty and staff in lis programs has become a popular subject of discussion in lis jaeger and franklin  subramaniam and jaeger  hirsh et al  lee et al   diversity as intellectual freedom the notion of values based diversity gives impetus to an in depth exploration of diversity as intellectual freedom intellectual freedom has always been one of the primary domainsand often battlefieldsof librarians and other information professionals and an expanded understanding of diversity draws attention to new aspects of the debate eg samek  hudson ward  samek   diversity as an engine of competitiveness on the job market and a staple of creativity and innovation in the present day many corporate partners realize that diversity and inclusion    are at the core of an organizations culture having a diverse and inclusive culture will positively affect innovation and the organizations bottom line its no longer a nice to have a strong di diversity and inclusion strategy aligned with the organizations business objectives is imperative gone are the days when it was only about affirmative action it leaders including apple google and microsoft incorporate diversity statements on their websites implement diversity strategies and make public the results of organizational diversity surveys see also caidi and dali   lis domains affected by diversity considerations and developments social justice and social inclusion are important in relation to information access the digital divide access the web page quoted at the time of writing in fall  has been replaced see society for human resource manent diversity  inclusion conference  exposition httpsconferencesshrmorgdiversity conference

diversity by design  english language classes to allow for faster professional integration of immigrants we allocate money to support the preservation of ethnocultural heritage and heritage languages we fund affirmative action united states and employment equity canada programs to improve the hiring and representation of immigrant professionals in our libraries and other information organizations we develop more rigorous hiring procedures to recruit internationally educated faculty in our graduate programs all these policies regulations funding and other support mechanisms will certainly help immigrants adjust faster and more effectively and yet despite their undeniable usefulness these measures can be seen as mechanisms to make immigrants more like their hosts so that they can better and faster fit with the way of life in the new country helping immigrants to adapt is admirable if simultaneously the host society is also changing in a way that adapts to the influx of a different cultural linguistic social and religious capital but therein lies the problem we believe that host societies do not change quickly or substantially enough would north american educational institutions revise their information literacy policies to incorporate traditional and non western systems of knowledge would north american organizations modify workplace etiquette to include the workplace practices and relationships of immigrant groups we all know the answer signage services and information in languages other than english as well as world language collections in libraries are no doubt positive signs but they do not amount to foundational change scholarly literature refers to immigrant adaptation as acculturation and acculturation is a two way street necessitating changes in both immigrant and host communities berry  if we go to great lengths to help immigrants become more like their hosts while the hosts have no intention of becoming more like the immigrants then there is no true acculturation inclusion does not mean only giving newcomers tools to change and adjust it also means changing host society practices and customs to reflect the immigrants heritage and ways of life insofar as such change does not contradict human rights core democratic values and civil liberties if a host society does not evolve and transform with a constant and substantial influx of new members can there be bona fide sociocultural inclusion or only a semblance thereof in our professional and academic milieu the aforementioned policies regulations and funding will certainly help diverse users and professionals but will they improve the overall diversity climate will they ensure that the colleagues of a new immigrant professional give him or her a warm welcome and help him or her acclimate or will this hiring breed misunderstanding and resentment in current staff members who might suspect that the newcomer scored an employment ticket by riding a diversity train instead of being hired for his or her qualifications will they alleviate the evergreen talk that taxpayers money is spent on world language collections and programming for ethnocultural communities while many hostcountry communities are in desperate need of investment and assistance
