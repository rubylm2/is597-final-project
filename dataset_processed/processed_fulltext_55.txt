subject variety in adult reading  educated women read two or more types but fewer than half the others read with a comparable degree of variety the part time workers have still another pattern education seems to make no difference all part time workers read with more variety than housewives these results lead us to wonder whether the same patterns are true for the amount of reading we have seen that reading variety and quantity of reading are closely related and table  shows how quantity of reading is related to employment status when education is held constant for housewives the pattern is the same college educated women tend to read very little more than those with less education part time workers and full time workers have similar patterns of reading quantity in both cases college education is likely to mean considerably more book reading while we found that education did not seem to affect the reading variety of the part time worker it definitely affects the reading quantity and the part time worker with high school education is no more likely to read a large number of books than is the housewife with comparable education there are a number of possible explanations which might be offered for these findings education does not seem to have much effect on the number of books a housewife reads or on the variety of subjects it must be remembered that by housewife we mean full time housewife in this sample  per cent of the working women with high school education and  per cent of the worktable  education employment status and variety in reading of women percentage reading two or more types of books frequently employment status education keep house work part time work full time per cent n per cent n per cent n high school or less        college        table  education employment status and quantity of reading of women percentage reading six or more books in six months employment status education keep house work part time work full time per cent n per cent n per cent n high school or less         college         forty five per cent of all readers read six or more books in six months
 the library quarterly ing women with college education are presently married education does make a considerable difference in both the quantity and variety in the reading of full time workers although the reading variety of part time workers does not increase with education the amount of reading does the high school educated part time worker reads with more variety than the housewife with the same education but she reads no more books in a given period of time apparently increased education does not stimulate the housewife to read more books or more subjects than the woman with less education the housewife may be too busy to read or the concerns of running a household may have superseded the interests which she acqiuired in school or perhaps she never expanded her interests beyond those she had in high school in her case college had little effect on her reading habits to the extent that they are reflected in the answers to these questions those who work present quite a different picture both variety and quantity of reading are considerably greater for college educated women than for those with less education probably the same factors influence these women to read as influence them to work energy both physical and intellectual and a desire for activity outside their homes their reading may reflect a desire for job related knowledge or information on the world around them or perhaps it reflects a wider range of recreational reading or all of these the part time worker apparently has both the time and the inclination to read more subjects but not more books than the housewife with comparable education since the part time worker is probably working because she wants to rather than because she must support herself or her family her working is likely to be a manifestation of the same interests that induce her to read still another factor in the relatively limited reading of the housewives may be the loneliness of housekeeping in terms of opportunity for discussion of books reading itself may be a solitary activity but in general it requires conversation if interest is to be sustained jan hajda discusses this in his study of readers and reading book reading in adult life is sustained not only by the existence of appropriate social ties within the proximate social structures but also by the recurrence of interpersonal situations which minimize the individual isolation from others to persist over the years the act of book reading must be incorporated at least intermittently into a social context reading a book becomes meaningful when after completion it is shared with others or acted upon in the company of others social integration which generates engagement with others also sustains a persistent engagement with books social isolation in contrast is likely to lead to the abandonment of books this type of social isolation may be one cause for the limited reading of retired people education and physical difficulties in reading or in obtaining books are undoubtedly more important but the lack of stimulation of conversation with working colleagues and friends may be a contributing factor summary in many of the characteristics of readers we have considered we cannot be sure what is cause and what is effect the persons who read many subjects read many books and this in turn leads to greater intensity the working  an american paradox people and books in a metropolis unpublished phd dissertation department of sociology university of chicago  p 
subject variety in adult reading  woman reads and works for many of the same reasons and her education stimulates both activities the reader who reads heavily at some time is likely to read heavily again as a reader becomes more involved in reading he is likely to use more sources for books and to exercise more independence of choice exposure may stimulate further interest if he continues to read until he is sixty five he will read with a little more variety than younger people in any event early involvement in reading is likely to lead to later variety and quantity of reading on the average this has a greater effect than later influences the more books a reader reads in a given period of time the more likely he is to read a number of different subjects heavy reading that begins early and continues through the reader life is more likely to be associated with variety than light or spasmodically heavy reading the more education he has had the more likely he is to read a number of different subjects education seems to make little difference in the reading variety of housewives but it significantly increases the reading variety of working women part time workers read with more variety than those who work full time variety in reading increases slightly with income even when education is held constant the proportion of people who read at all decreases sharply with age and increases with income sex differences are not significant libraries surpass bookstores as the more important source only for those who read many types of books the more types of books a person reads the more sources he is likely to use lester asheim summed up a discussion of these factors as follows we know that the readers are the ones with the most education education is the major correlate of reading no matter how you approach it it is clear that in each of the other groupings mentioned above age occupation and economic status education is a hidden factor and within each group the difference between those who read much and those who read little is education we could add to this that the difference between those who read many subjects and those who read few subjects is also education this is the first part of a two part article part ii on characteristics of readers will appear in the july  issueeditor what do adults read in clift ed op cit see n  above p
