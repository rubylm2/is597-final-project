german libraries and scientific and technical information in nazi germany pamela spence richards national socialist policies drastically altered the roles of germany various scientific and technical library networks the ability of the libraries in these systems to supply the results of current research to their users depended greatly on their access to foreign publications nazi ideological objections to foreign research were articulated in a series of laws and decrees that effectively prevented publicly accessible general state and university libraries from supplying foreign journals to their clientele technological university libraries open to a smaller circle grew in importance during the reich both as collections and as agencies of dissemination to government and industry private industrial research libraries using their own funds as well as the services of foreign subsidiaries also flourished under the nazis and profited from the additional dissemination services provided by the technological universities the decline in general university libraries and the rise of industrial collections reflected the overall diversion of research under the nazis from universities to the laboratories and proving grounds of industry the second world war has a special place in the history of the exchange of scientific and technical information it severed the flow of information between germany and the allies much more radically than had the first world war the traditional channels of exchange such as conferences visiting professorships research internships and most impor written with the support of grants from the american philosophical society and the rutgers research council  school of communication information and library studies rutgers university new brunswick new jersey   i have translated the german technische hochschule as technological university throughout although technological institute as in massachusetts institute of technology is a more accurate rendering in this article it would lead to the confusion of the technische hochschulen with the nonautonomous institutes within german universities library quarterly vol  no  pp   c  by the university of chicago all rights reserved     
 the library quarterly tant for this discussion the scholarly book trade were all closed off in september  at the same time the hostile governments knew not only that the new war was going to be the most technological conflict ever but also that the pure sciences theoretical as well as experimental offered prospects for victory that could not be ignored nor were physics and chemistry the only sciences to be harnessed for the war effort geography biology history and psychology all were made to play their part on both sides consequently a keen awareness grew that setting up alternative systems for information gathering was absolutely imperative not only must information gathering be organized of equal importance for the mobilization of scientific knowledge was its documentationindexing abstracting and dissemination the institutions on each side that were involved in the war effort were pretty much the same governmental and military agencies scientific institutions in academe and industry and most important the research libraries the contributions of these individual agencies and their relative importance in the common effort however seem to differ in very interesting ways when we compare their functioning in germany and the western alliance elsewhere i have tried to reconstruct the american organization set up to deal with these matters and to describe its impact on the us library system after the war  in this article i shall attempt to do the same for germany the differences to which i allude are not only the consequences of the war situation in part they reflect national peculiarities in the patterns of organization of higher education library systems industry culture and political institutions that are rooted in the pre world war i period one powerful factor absent in the west was the totalitarian organization of the german state after march  and its obsession with thought control the national socialist government had for ideological reasons begun well before the outbreak of war in  to control the flow of scientific and technical information in germany and had severely affected the functioning of the research library systems my first task will be to sketch the german scientific and technical information network as it was organized around libraries before  the library system was quite variegated royal collections had grown into huge state libraries in berlin and munich universities and their institutes had accumulated both central libraries and specialized serninar libraries over generations more recently private industrial research libraries had been founded and finally there were the libraries belonging to germany new technological universities all these categories of scientific and technical information agencies were affected by national socialist policy differently a serious difficulty encountered immediately when trying to reconstruct the information system in the national
libraries and information in nazi germany  socialist era is the paucity of primary source material the immense wartime destruction of germany libraries resulting in the loss of  percent of the holdings of her state supported scientific and technical libraries  p  the understandable reluctance of many german librarians to dwell on the national socialist years and their distraction by the challenges of reconstructing the profession in a divided nation all play a role in the almost total lack of historical treatment of foreign scientific and technical information flow into the third reich the evidence for this investigation is drawn from the german library literature of the s mainly the prestigious zentralblatt fur bibliothekswesen and from prewar proceedings of conferences of the international federation of documentation the most valuable sources however have been the memories of many of the german men and women who were personally involved in the scientific and technical information supply chain of the period of these most important were the recollections of gisela von busse from  to  chief of the acquisitions bureau for german libraries established by the emergency association of german science notgemeinschaft der deutschen wissenschaft for personal descriptions of the role of industrial research libraries in the information network i rely chiefly on information supplied by herbert tamme former head of the huge technical library of krupp steelworks at essen the following account based as it is on memory fragments and the chance survival of single copies of reports and invoices is necessarily incomplete and is offered as an initial framework for future scholarship it is written with no small sense of urgency since the sources of oral history vital to its completion are diminishing in number with every passing year germany scientific and technical libraries before world war i over the course of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the various states lander of which germany was composed had developed a decentralized research library network in which the task of collecting current scientific and technical information was split between two broad  her kind support led to the cooperation of the current directors and staffs of the university libraries at gttingen hanover tubingen freiburg im breisgau and the technological university of berlin all of whom searched their archives and memories for clues to the system dr friedhilde krause general director of the german state library in east berlin likewise mobilized her staff on my behalf to mr helmut drubba retired head of reader services at the university and technical information library at hanover i am especially indebted for his willingness to share not only his knowledge of the history of the period but also his wide cirde of acquaintances in german technical information circles
 the library quarterly groups on the one hand making available research publications mainly in the pure sciences were public institutions such as the two huge state libraries at munich and berlin and the libraries of the universities both central and institute all these facilities were funded by the states in which they were located and wee open to the general public as well as to the universities students and faculty the largest of these libraries reported their new acquisitions to the royal library in berlin which subsequently announced them in its berliner titeldrucke  the publications of the applied sciences on the other hand were collected mainly by germany burgeoning industrial research libraries which received no government support some of these libraries were foupded and developed by trade or technical associations such as the coal mining association huge bergbau bibliothek mining library in essen founded in  and the library of the verein deutscher eisenhuttenleute german steel association in dusseldorf founded  others were maintained by single corporations such as the immense libraries of the bayer and krupp organizations founded  and  respectively these proprietary libraries had highly selective acquisitions policies and served only their own constituencies  pp   lying somewhere in between these two broad groups but not yet so important were the libraries of germany technological universities technische hochschulen mostly founded in the course of the nineteenth century near the seats of industry the technological universities addressed themselves purely to training in the applied sciences their libraries unlike those of the general universities were not autonomous units but lay under the jurisdiction of the institutions senates  p  partly as a result of their budgetary dependence the collections tended to be closely bound to the courses of instruction and were available only for the use of the faculty and the student body  p  one indication of these libraries status in late wilhelmian germany is the fact that the three largest technological universities those at berlin charlottenburg aachen and hanover were not permitted to hire professional librarians until   p  while at the general universities the employment of full time professional library directors was widespread by   p  despite germany preeminence in pure and applied science during this period no one especially in the applied sciences felt that the  institute libraries were noncirculating after a decree to that effect in  and they tended to be used mainly by individuals known to the director  p   the technological universities did not gain equal status with the general universities until  when william ii gave them the right to grant doctorates  p   between the awarding of the first nobel prize in  and the outbreak of the first world war germans received fourteen of the forty eight science awards just under one third encyclpacdia britannica th ed micropaedia sv nobel prize winners
libraries and information in nazi germany  system of information delivery in these areas was adequate the lack of technical materials in the general state and university libraries was loudly lamented  p  as was the narrowness of scope of the technological university libraries  p  the professional associations were dissatisfied with the textbook oriented restricted collections of the latter and called for a national central library of science and technology basic to many of the demands for reform was the sense that the establishment of technological universities in the seats of industry rather than as faculties of the general universities had driven a wedge between the applied sciences pure sciences and the liberal arts that could have unhealthy consequences  p  the weimar period following what english prime minister lloyd george called an engineer war  p  would sae greater attention given the problem of scientific and technical information delivery and the role of the technological universities in the process the s while the public and industrial research libraries of germany escaped physical damage during the first world war their isolation behind the   british blockade created critical lacunae in their collections of foreign publications moreover the huge war reparations imposed on germany by the treaty of versailles produced an inflationary spiral that so devalued the mark that the purchase of foreign publications continued to be extremely difficult right through  of approximately  foreign journals held by publicly funded german libraries in  for example only  were still being kept current in   p  some assistance was received from abroad during this crisis the nordic countries sent their entire scientific production and switzerland its publications the american library association forwarded duplicates from its members and the rockefeller foundation paid for medical and social science books and journals  p  various attempts to coordinate library acquisitions were made during this crisis a government decree of  for example obligated all institute libraries to inform their central university libraries of their current subscriptions to foreign serials so that expensive duplication could be avoided  p  but the foreign aid and emergency decrees did little to fill the gaps in germany collections german industrialists bestirred themselves on several fronts in efforts to remedy the breakdown in scientific and technical communication in  a new mark introduced in the monetary reform of november  was exchangeable for  trillion of the old marks
 the library quarterly  under the aegis of an umbrella group of technical societies deutscher verband technisch wissenschafticher vereine they sent a resolution to the government the general and technological universities and the state libraries in which they demanded as a necessary foundation for the reconstruction of the national economy the creation of a central technical library based on the collections of the patent office in berlin founded in  this was the largest scientific and technical library in germany collecting the patent literature of the entire developed world its use however had always been restricted to the office research staff  p  financial constraints however ultimately forced the rejection of this proposal by the weimar government in   p  another initiative from the private sector had a more enduring effect on germany scientific and technical library development in  a group of prominent industrialists publishers scientists and scholars founded the emergency association of german science notgemeinschaft der deutschen wissenschaft whose library board was charged with coordinating cooperative acquisition of foreign materials for all of germany major research libraries domestic acquisitions continued to be funded by the states but foreign acquisitions were paid for by the association with private sector funds after  by the central weimar government books and journals were bought en masse through a special agency set up by the german publishers association borsenverein in leipzig and then shipped on to germany research libraries  p  by  five years after the dawes plan had brought some economic stability to germany german library subscriptions had risen to number  foreign journal titles more than twice as many as in  of which the overwhelming number were acquired through the emergency association by  due to regional protests over centralization the funding of foreign materials was relegated back to the states and the worldwide economic crisis subsequently led to a radical downturn in foreign subscriptions between  and   p  despite the inflation at the beginning of the decade and the depression at the end the s should not be regarded as a time of stagnation or decline in germany scientific and technical information delivery system for it was during this period that publicly funded technological university libraries rather than industrial research libraries began to play the foremost role in the process much of the dynamism of the technological universities must be attributed to the spectacular growth in their student enrollment which more than doubled in germany be named after american banker charles g dawes the plan called for the french evacuation of the economically vital ruhr reduction in reparations and foreign aid to germany see  p

 the library quarterly  p  it is difficult to determine the exact number of librarians affected by the law but it is probable that several score lost their jobs as a result there were eight academic librarians dismissed from the prussian state library alone  p   industrial research libraries did not feel the results of nazi racism directly since industry employees were not civil servants but they shared some of the indirect consequences namely the decline in the quality of german science and technology in the course of the s the race laws brought to an end german advances in those fields of the pure sciences such as physics and mathematics where germany had owed her preeminence to jews  p  by the end of   percent of germany academic physicists  percent of its mathematicians and  percent of its chemists had left their posts  p  and within one year the quality of research at the universities had deteriorated so visibly that german industry was weighing the possibility of training doctoral candidates itself  p  modern historians of german technology point to the dependence of technology on physics and the other pure sciences and cite the race laws as one of the causes of the radical downturn in the number of german patents granted after  from  in  to  in   pp   inevitably the race laws led as well to a deterioration of germany scientific publications after  in the fall of that year arnold berlineri editor of the internationally respected journal die naturwissenschaften was warned by the authorities that he had too many non aryan contributors the number and quality of contributions to naturwissenschaften and other german scientific periodicals fell off swiftly after the implementation of racist editorial policies and after  many foreign libraries especially outside europe simply canceled their subscriptions to a number of previously respected german journals  p  restriction of foreign acquisitions nazi ideology affected not just germany own output of scientific and technical information but its libraries ability to obtain the results of foreign research as well one of the basic nazi tenets was the belief that all culture including science derived its validity from race and homeland blut und boden and that truths as determined by non germans were not necessarily true for germans nobel prize winning physicist johannes stark whose aversion to the jewish relativity theories of  berliner himself ajew was driven from the editorship in  and committed suicide in   p

 the library quarterly the ministry of economics the foreign office and the army high command the decision taken at this meeting to found a new organization to be called the german society for documentation marked the entrance of the nazi government into a period of much more direct involvement with documentation matters the society governance placed it under firm reich control the chairman was to be appointed by the minister of education who in turn appointed a board made up of representatives from science technology and industry as well as agencies of the reich from this board the chairman named the society vicechairman secretary and treasurer  pp   at the same meeting fritz prinzhorn by then director of the leipzig university library was appointed chairman and it was decided that the documentation society would assume the activities of the former committee on professional library standards including continued publication of its bulletin dokumentation und arbeitstechnik the task groups were taken over as a whole and three new ones formed for terminology journal clipping files and significantly the acquisition of foreign scientific literature the charge of this latter group was to discuss review and attempt all possible means of acquisition and to fill any gaps in the literature as they are discovered  and to create an organization that establishes a central record of those information centers in germany where each imported journal can be found  pp   in december  the new documentation society managed to publish a classified  page union list zentralnachweise fur ausldndischer literatur which provided an inventory of all foreign publications reported to have been imported into germany since september   published in potsdam under the direction of maximilian pflucke longtime editor of chemisches zentralblatt the documentation society union list issued  volumes by august  essentially a guide to the location of recent journals from the united states and the british commonwealth the union list gave only titles volumes available and location according to its introduction it drew most heavily on the holdings of the reich five official acquisitions centers the german chemical society the prussian state library the hamburg world economics institute and two commercial publishers lange and springer in berlin and koehler and volckmar in leipzig fifteen locations were given five of which were industrial libraries four of these were i g farben installations  even in nomenclature this task group simnilarity to its american counterpart is striking compare the oss interdepartmental committee for the acquisition of foreign publications  p   curiously predeek unit at the berlin technological university is not on the official list
libraries and information in nazi germany  owners of the listed volumes were obligated to supply copies to querors  but the zentralnachweise can only be considered a fairly accurate reflection of holdings in the reich publicly funded libraries despite an order from deputy reich chancellor martin bormann rundschreiben no  stipulating that all current foreign holdings had to be reported to the society for documentation  submission of titles by private firms while extensive was certainly not complete competition for patents was still too intense to permit sharing everything with rivals the chief of the secret police sd complained to goebbels ministry in a letter of february   that he had proof that companies and research institutes were selfishly keeping their best new acquisitions to themselves despite orders from the highest level to inform the documentation society of their receipt  destruction from the air the technical information supply system of the third reich was brought to an end not by the lack of available foreign journals but rather by the destruction between  and  of the agencies of dissemination the import of foreign periodicals which depended most heavily on portugal after america entry into the war was threatened when the allied invasions of france in the summer of  cut off land routes to germany however regular air traffic between germany and the iberian peninsula a daily lufthansa flight to spain and weekly to portugal kept foreign journals coming in right into   but inside the reich itself the information chain disintegrated under the hail of british and american bombs in  the entire technological university at berlincharlottenburg including its library of a quarter of a million volumes was totally destroyed  p  hardly anything remained of predeek information center neither its clipping files its photographic equipment nor its massive collection of foreign technical and scientific journals predeek and the survivors on his staff took what was left of the materials with them to an evacuation site at rossla in the harz mountains where they kept working  p  incredibly the monthly issues of the referatenblatt published collaboratively by the information centers at hamburg and the berlin technological university continued  after the war predeek was director of the library of the university of jena from  to  in november  he was made honorary professor of library science at the free university of west berlin he died on february   at the age of seventythree 
 the library quarterly to appear until november   fortunately the review itself was printed in hamburg where despite terrible destruction the world economics institute survived the entire war relatively unscathed the traditional technical and scientific reviews some of them dating from the nineteenth century were soon wiped out as well chemisches zentralblatt biologisches zentralblatt and many other scientific and technical reviews were published in leipzig where on the night of december   the raf dropped  tons of bombs on the center of the city destroying the plants of  percent of the book city publishers paper manufacturers and type founders by october  the german publishing industry as a whole was reduced to littde more than  percent of its prewar production as air raids and shortages of paper lead and electricity forced the merger or suspension of all journals not considered absolutely essential for germany daily information needs  exhibits f and g busse acquisitions bureau in the prussian state library was bombed repeatedly from  on forcing it to turn much of its foreign acquisitions work back to the individual research libraries  in the last months of the war when the prussian state library had been totally evacuated the bureau moved to eberswalde from which its workers finally fled before the advancing russian army  conclusions and implications looking back over the twelve years of nazi information policy we may draw some conclusions about its effectiveness we are struck first of all by its contradictory nature this was perhaps most clearly visible in the example of the government decrees forbidding the import of foreign literature dismayed by the resulting scarcity of information the nazis subsequently had to establish the german society for documentation to expedite the flow of technical information foreign includedthroughout the reich totalitarian fear of public access to information led the government to isolate most academic librarians from the process and create a new profession with a strictly limited clientele  closed for three years after the war the institute and its enormous library and information center are now public scholarly facilities informationszentrum in hwwa institute fir wirtschaftsforschung hamburg in new quarters on the outskirts of the city   most of these decrees were not published in official organs and can only be traced through surviving official correspondence one such letter forbids public use of nature because of the british journal contemptuous remarks about german science   not unexpectedly many academic librarians looked with deep suspicion at the development of the favored new rival profession of documentation for some idea of the resentment felt by librarians toward documentalists see 
libraries and information in nazi germany  reich policies also were inefficient no mechanism was ever developed to exploit effectively the acquisitions of the privately owned industrial research libraries which only shared their holdings with other libraries or with the government when such action posed no threat to corporate profits  p   some government agencies were particularly favored with information from industrial libraries the army high command was well supplied by i g farben  p  others such as several intelligence units had to fend for themselves thus industrial libraries only profited from the system they contributed little in return the nazis overt favoring of industrial libraries at the expense of general university collections is all the more interesting when compared to the american wartime organization in which university libraries occupied priority positions  p  this difference surely had to do with where the most important research was taking place in either country whether it was a fear of the liberal atmosphere of the great universities or the aggressiveness of the german cartels the fact is that in germany the most advanced work was being done in the laboratories and proving grounds of industry the us government located the manhattan project on the campuses of berkeley columbia and chicago but the center of atomic research in germany was in the plants of i g farben which had a monopoly on heavy water production in the reich  p  america university libraries emerged from the war with greatly enhanced status and resources as a result of their defense related work for germany the question arises as to how the diminished role of the academic librarian in state and university libraries and the enhanced status of the documentalist in technological collections affected the evolution of these branches of the information profession a conclusive answer to this question awaits a thorough study of the reconstruction of research libraries and librarianship in both the public and private sector in postwar germany and must include the perceptions practical priorities and ideological objectives of the four allied occupational authorities whose directives were so vital in reshaping germany information infrastructure a second even more complex question that arises from the inquiry described in this article concerns the implications of permitting such a large proportion of a nation publicly funded information resources to bypass publicly available libraries and be channeled  an extreme case of such independent scrounging was the november  mission to maine dispatched by the party intelligence branch sicherheitsdieust two german agents were put ashore with orders to proceed to new york bookstores and public libraries reduce essential information in technical books and journals to microfilm and insert them in letters to the agency men in madrid the fbi managed to arrest both agents before any information was transmitted  pp
