recruiting and retaining students of color in us programs  also create a sense of belonging and membership l ethnicity is a key factor for interpersonal similarity as it is closely related to the cultural as well as physical connections between individuals in libraries as in other public organizations it is important to have enough librarians of color so that all users regardless of their ethnic and cultural background can see authority figures such as librarians and teachers who look like them this would make the users feel comfortable and affirmed that they are in the right place furthermore ethnic diversity is important because it enriches a society by offering all citizens more opportunities to experience learn and understand one another over the last few decades lis schoolsprograms have worked diligently to recruit people of color into the information profession and other related organizations also have been stalwart in supporting recruitment programs ala for example created the spectrum initiative in  to promote diversity in the library community and recruit minority librarians by providing scholarships mentoring and training programs a number of lis schools have supported the spectrum initiative scholarship program by agreeing to make additional financial commitments to the effort by either matching grants or supplementing them  since its foundation in   the institute of museum and library services imls has also helped lis schools increase the number of students of color through scholarships recruitment programs such as knowledge river and praxis practice reflection advocacy excellence inquiry solutions and other initiatives despite such efforts however the progress in recruiting and retaining students of color has been rather slow and the gap between the proportion of ethnic minorities in the us population and in the lis field remains significantly large to minimize the gap it is essential to develop and implement effective programs to recruit and retain students of color in lis programs while there is no lack of suggested strategies for recruiting and retaining minorities there is a dearth of empirical research on the issues compared to other professional fields fewer empirical studies have been conducted in lis to analyze and compare the preference for and effectiveness of such strategies of the few most have focused on the recruitment of minority librarians not minority students furthermore research based on input from librarians and students of color  the target group of the recruitmentretention efforts  is scarce a rare exception is a survey of librarians of color by buttlar and cay non conducted more than a decade ago   in the study the authors surveyed librarians of color to identify why they chose to enter the library profession and what they think lis schools should do to attract ethnic minorities as librarians and students of color are the targets and recipients of the lis schools recruitment and retention programs their views and input are critical more research is needed in order to collect analyze and give voice to the views of librarians and students of color regarding recruitment and retention in lis education

recruiting and retaining students of color in us programs  support would be important for retaining students of color ranked th and th respectively the american indian group indicated that offering distance education is effective ranked th preparation for diversity diversity in lis education and librarianship cannot be achieved by having a diverse student population in lis programs alone the importance of diversity should be acknowledged embraced and supported by the entire lis community all lis students  the future lis professionals  should value diversity and be prepared to serve the diverse public in relation to this issue an open ended question was asked what suggestions would you give to lis schoolsprograms to better prepare all lis students to work in a diverse multicultural community suggestions included  to reform the curriculum to incorporate diversity issues and multiculturalism  to provide internshipfieldwork opportunities to work in diverse communities  to make faculty and students aware of the importance of diversity and  to have diverse faculty and students discussion and conclusion students satisfaction is one of the key measures that can be used to evaluate the success of a program the response from participants who were the target customers of the recruitment retention efforts seems to suggest that recruitment and retention efforts have not been particularly successful interestingly however those from a completely distance program were found to be quite satisfied with recruitment efforts their comments in open ended questions indicated that their programs did a good job in recruitment by making all the useful information available through the web site and other promotional materials andor by using personal contacts this seems to suggest that distance programs tend to incorporate more aggressive strategies to recruit students further research is needed to investigate if and why students in distance education programs are more satisfied with their school efforts at recruiting minorities recruitment and retention strategies regarding recruitment three different groups of strategies have been suggested to be important the first one is related to diversity in facultystaff and studentsalumni the participants made it clear that having more faculty of color in the lis schoolprogram and having faculty staffalumni of color involved in the recruitment process would attract more students of color such individuals could be good role models to the students as well previous research supports that using role models andor authoritative figures of color for recruitment is critically important if students see role models from ethnic minority groups in their everyday life and also during the recruitment process they would be able to relate themselves more easily to the model figures and the field where the role models work and feel more confident about their success in the field
 journal of education for library and information science the second group of recruitment strategies is related to support through scholarshipfinancial aid or work opportunities as pursuing an lis program requires a significant investment from students it would be helpful if lis programs assist the students to get some financial support through either scholarshipfinancial aid or job opportunities in lis related areas finally the third group of strategies is associated with active recruitment many participants responded that they had not seen any visible effort for recruitment made by their lis programs better communication and advertisement of lis programs particularly in mediapublications targeted at people of color and active solicitation of students of color including personal contacts are obviously key strategies which is consistent with buttlar and caynon findings it will also be helpful if we can develop a more creative recruitmentpromotional program such as a summer camp where prospective students get an opportunity to learn from and work with lis faculty students and professionals for the retention aspect the top ten strategies can be divided again into three groups as in recruitment offering financial support and providing workcareer opportunities through effective careerjob placement services were suggested as crucial in retention the importance of financial support in recruitment and retention is well documented the need to pay for tuition and other expenses can be partially resolved through getting financial aid or holding a job by offering more assistantships scholarships financial aid and work opportunities lis schools can help students stay in the program without worrying about financial issues to assist students in job searches it will be necessary for lis schools to provide effective careerjob placement services the second group of strategies is linked to support from facultystaff students and ethnic associations support from facultystaff peer students and other groups would be critical to the success of any students in lis programs including students of color faculty and staff members should be sensitive to students needs and be able to provide effective academic and career advising mentoring systems would be particularly important for students of color as they have to cope with cultural loneliness for this it would be necessary that lis programs train all the members in the program to be aware of the importance of diversity and to better understand and appreciate other cultures in addition having a system in place to support and reinforce diversity might be helpful having ethnic associations and communities get involved in teaching and other activities might also be useful as this could help students learn more about diversity and become more connected to diverse communities the third group is related to curriculum and class schedule which is another important issue for the retention of students of color it is crucial to have a curriculum incorporating diversity and multiculturalism because it will help all students to learn to appreciate other cultures and their values and also to become competent to work in an increasingly diverse society regarding the class schedule a number of participants suggested that flexi
recruiting and retaining students of color in us programs  ble class time would be helpful in retaining students this seems to have some connection with financial issues as the amount of financial aid lis schoolsprograms can offer is limited this option would be helpful for those who need to work in order to support their studies or those who are already working this observation seems to be confirmed by previous research mccook and moen discovered that financial assistance was the second most important reason for selecting a particular lis school among full time students while openness to the working adult ie flexibility of scheduling and availability of advising was the second most important reason among part time students many lis schools already offer courses in evening hours or during the weekend in addition an increasing number of schools have online courses to accommodate these needs for those schools offering distance education courses however it should be ensured that all students be equipped with the necessary technologies and learning skills as some individuals or ethnic groups are less likely to have access to such facilities strategies for different ethnic groups when suggestions regarding recruitment and retention strategies were compared some differences were found among ethnic groups for example american indians ranked high the offering of distance education options for both recruitment and retention it seems that american indians tend to prefer to stay where they are more than other groups this is consistent with the findings of the lissada survey only  of american indian participants moved to a different state to attend lis programs which was the lowest rate among ethnic minority groups for recruitment african americans suggested that presenting lis programs in undergraduate classes and high schools would be very effective both african americans and american indians regarded the use of recruitment materials developed for students of color as one of the most effective strategies hispanics and asian americans on the other hand felt that having a diverse student body in lis programs would be one of the key strategies to attract students of color although different ethnic groups are often lumped together as a minority it is apparent that they have different views and need different recruitmentretention strategies in order to better understand each of the ethnic groups and to refine strategies that would work best for each group more in depth research is called for diversity for all simply producing more librarians of color alone cannot help lis programs succeed if their graduates regardless of their background are not prepared to work in an increasingly diverse society to better prepare their students the study suggests that lis programs need to work on several areas first they need curriculum reform in order to incorporate diversity issues and multiculturalism it is desirable that this includes not only offering
 journal of education for library and information science courses dedicated to diversity multiculturalism issues but also incorporating such issues in required courses as suggested by some researchers and several study participants helping students gain work experience in diverse communities through fieldwork or practica would also be crucial in addition helping all faculty and students become aware of the importance of diversity and having a diverse faculty and student body would be of paramount importance some progress has been made but lis programs will need to continue their endeavors in improving these areas lis associations can help lis programs with some of the areas the associations can offer diversity workshops through which lis facultystaff can be trained at the same time they can work with lis programs to reach out to different communities which will help both recruitment and retention of students of color in addition the associations can collaborate with lis programs and libraries to provide more internship opportunities as well as financial supportfellowship libraries are another important partner they can help lis programs in many different ways such as in curriculum reform and teaching providing mentoring and role models and offering internship opportunities among others for more effective recruitment and retention of students lis programs will need to build a strong partnership with other organizations and work closely with them future research the study findings helped examine and assess the efforts in recruiting and retaining students of color in lis programs and shed light on some key areas of improvement for such endeavors the study also suggested the importance of using different strategies depending on target groups finally it offered a direction for making the lis education relevant to a society that is becoming culturally and ethnically diverse it should be noted however that this study had some limitations that need to be addressed in future research readers should be cautioned against over generalizing the results of this study the sampling frame does not include all librarians of color in the us only those who were members of the ethnic caucuses and other associations affiliated with ala although the study is not intended to be generalizable to all librarians of color in the us the study is an exploratory first step to better understand the perspectives of the librarians of color  former lis students of color  concerning lis recruitment and retention larger scale studies with a representative sample will help increase the external validity of the research findings future research using a combination of survey and other qualitative research methods is needed to develop and refine strategies for different ethnic minority groups analyses of the current curriculum will also be useful towards curricular reform for multiculturalism and for a better preparation of our students faculty and staff for our diverse society studies on recruitment and retention strategies used in other disciplines eg education en
