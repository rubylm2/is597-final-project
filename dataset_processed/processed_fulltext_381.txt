the nature of paper b l browning definition and origin paper is so ubiquitous in our daily lives that it is difficult to imagine effective functioning of our technological society without it indeed we often measure the level of contemporary cultures by the amount of paper consumed in the united states the amount is more than  pounds per capita annually and is rising year by year the contributions of paper are not without drawbacks a limited supply of fibrous source materials problems of air and water pollution in manufacturing processes and questions of disposal of the paper once it has served its intended purposes paper has not always held so important a place in the human economy the multitude of demands that paper now fills were necessarily satisfied by other materials it is significant that the earliest use of paper was in written communication in this it was preceded by other less abundant or less appropriate materials baked clay tablets in the near east sheets of papyrus in the nile valley parchment or vellum in the near east and europe cloth or strips of wood and bamboo in china and sheets of macerated barks in oceania africa and the early americas the word paper is used to describe a felted sheet of fibers formed by passing a liquid suspension of the fibers through a fine screen the liquid drains away to leave a mat of fibers which is removed from the screen and dried the definition is general the fibers commonly used are composed chiefly of cellulose although paper can be and is made from fibers of many other types including glass asbestos wool metals and synthetic polymers the liquid is almost always water although other liquids can be used water is inexpensive and plentiful and its interaction with cellulose fibers contributes unique properties in swelling of fibers during mechanical processing and in formation of the paper sheet and in fiber to fiber bonding which occurs as the sheet is dried and which is responsible for the greater part of the mechanical strength of paper paper is reported to have been in use in china before the christian era although hou han shu book of the second han dynasty credits its invention in ad  to tsi lun who is said to have made sheets of paper from macerated tree bark hemp waste old rags and fishnets  the craft soon spread to korea and japan and found its way into central asia and persia by the routes of the camel caravans the arabs began making paper about ad  and the art spread to syria egypt and morocco the moors introduced paper into spain about ad  in  a paper mill was established at fabriano italy papermaking began in france and germany in the fourteenth century and in england in the fifteenth the first american paper mill was established in  near germantown pennsylvania by william rittenhouse a dutch papermaker until the invention of the paper machine paper was made by a labori
the nature of paper  ous hand process common materials in europe were cotton and linen rags and hemp the wet fibers were stamped or pounded by hand until they reached a condition suitable for papermaking and then made into a dilute suspension in a large tank or vat a portion of the suspension was dipped up into a rectangular mold fitted at the bottom with a wire screen and the water was allowed to drain away while the papermaker gently shook the mold from side to side to ensure even formation of the sheet the wet sheet was couched from the screen by pressing a felt or blotter against it and a stack of felts and paper sheets was compacted in a screw press to flatten the sheets and to remove additional water the stack was then separated and the sheets were allowed to dry in the air the surface of the paper was smoothed or burnished by rubbing it with a polished stone and sizings of animal glue or starch were applied to writing paper to prevent feathering of inks the invention of the printing press with movable type in the fifteenth century and the growing demand for printing and writing papers created increasing pressure on the supply and on the requisite raw materials these needs were met by the paper machine and by the use of fibers from wood in  the fourdrinier machine was invented by nicholas louis robert of france and development by the fourdrinier brothers in england followed soon thereafter the paper machine forms presses and dries the sheet in one continuous operation machinemade papers were introduced in the early s and rapidly found their way into newsprint writing and printing papers today except for the making of some special art papers the craft of hand papermaking in the united states is restricted to a few hobbyists handmade paper is still produced in europe and the far east as production of paper grew an increasing scarcity of cotton fibers developed and there was intense competition in the markets for used cotton clothing and rags cloth wrappings from egyptian mummies were imported in large quantities in the early nineteenth century sometimes over the violent opposition of many citizens who feared they might transmit disease other sources of fibers also proved inadequate and attention was directed to wood the first suggestion that paper could be produced from wood appears to have been made in  by the naturalist reamur who observed the paperlike quality of wasps nests made from wood the idea was not reduced to practice and only with the invention of chemical pulping processes with wood as an abundant raw material was the production of paper on a large scale made possible the materials of paper fimers cellulose fibers are the chief source of fibrous materials for papermaking only a few specialty papers include fibers of other compositions cellulose fibers from many sources are used fibers from the seed hair of cotton are the purest form of cellulose raw cotton after dewaxing and a mild alkali cook is essentially pure cellulose cellulose is a high polymer that is it is made up of many single relatively simple units combined chemically into very large molecules the individual units are composed of molecules of glucose or grape sugar combined with loss of one molecule of water from

the nature of paper  making fibers approximately  percent of the papermaking pulps produced in the united states are derived from wood other fiber sources include straws bamboo and sugarcane bagasse these are important in countries in which they are available in quantity and which lack adequate wood resources all these fibrous materials contain ligneous binding substances together with the group of carbohydrates which accompany cellulose in plants and are called the hemicelluloses the fibers must be separated from the lignin and the major portion of the hemicelluloses by processes of chemical digestion and bleaching to yield fibrous pulps that are suitable for papermaking pulps are manufactured from wood by several processes see for example   mechanical pulp or groundwood is produced by grinding peeled bolts of wood against a rotating abrasive stone under a stream of water or by grinding chips in a disk type mill properly prepared groundwood consists of separated fibers and fiber bundles it contains all the components of the original wood except for the slight loss of watersoluble materials chemical wood pulp is prepared by digesting wood chips with a cooking or pulping liquor at elevated temperatures  c under pressure in the acid sulfite process the cooking liquor contains calcium sodium or ammonium bisulfite with an excess of free sulfurous acid the bisulfite process uses a less acid liquor in which the chemical is magnesium or sodium bisulfite in the neutral sulfite or neutral sulfite semichemical nssc process the cooking liquor contains sodium sulfite plus sodium bicarbonate the pulping reactions take place in a weakly alkaline solution the oldest chemical pulping process is the soda process in which the chips are cooked with a solution of caustic soda this process produces a bulky pulp with good opacity and was in the past favored for manufacture of book papers but production is now unimportant in comparison with other processes over  percent of the chemical wood pulp is now produced by the sulfate or kraft process in which the cooking liquor contains sodium hydroxide caustic soda plus sodium sulfide the spent fig schematic representation of the cell wall of a softwood fiber after h meier m  middle lamella p  primary wall si s ss  secondary wall liquor is concentrated and burned for recovery of inorganic chemicals sodium sulfate salt cake is frequently used to make up chemical losses accounting for the name sulfate process chemical pulps produced by any of these processes are tan to brown in color and contain residual lignin not removed by pulping a white pulp is produced by a bleaching process to remove residual lignin and other organic impurities common bleaching agents are chlorine gas hypochlorites chlorine dioxide and peroxides these are applied in one or another sequence with washing or alkaline extraction between stages pulps for conversion to

 the library quarterly age during use permanence is determined by the composition of the paper and by external conditions to which it is subjected during storage or use factors influencing permanence the factors which influence permanence may be divided into a internal factors which are established primarily by the composition of the paper and b external factors which are determined by conditions during storage and use for example temperature relative humidity of the atmosphere which controls the hygroscopic moisture content of the sheet exposure to light atmospheric contaminants sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides ozone and the existence of biological hazards decay by bacteria or fungi and attack by insects or rodents the control of internal factors is in the province of the manufacturer who must choose the raw materials and processes which are requisite for production of paper having the necessary stability for intended uses control of external factors is the responsibility of the user methods for control of atmospheric contamination and biological deterioration are obvious and well known even if burdensome hence for any selected paper the additional important conditions for maintaining stability available to the user are control of temperature and relative humidity permanence of the fibers is governed largely by the resistance of cellulose to deterioration pure cellulose is a relatively stable organic compound when stored under optimal conditions it can be preserved for centuries or millennia without severe deterioration nevertheless it is subject to alteration by several types of chemical attack of which the most important from the viewpoint of permanence are oxidation hydrolysis and photochemical reactions cellulose is oxidized by atmospheric oxygen although under normal conditions the rate of oxidation reactions is slow oxidation leads to formation of carbonyl reducing groups and of carboxyl acidic groups at one or more locations in the glucose units which comprise the cellulose chain molecule oxidation also results in formation of peroxides  which contribute to further oxidation and side reactions ozone in the atmosphere even in minute concentrations is a very active deteriorative reagent the formation of oxidation products may be accompanied by immediate scission of the polymeric chain molecule or it may result in a sensitivity to further deterioration by a variety of influences the poor stability of oxycellulose has been abundantly established  pt  chap  the hydrolysis of cellulose by acid attack leads to decrease in length of the polymeric chain molecule through random scission of the chains the strength of the fiber is decreased deterioration may proceed so far that the fiber becomes very weak and brittle and finally can be reduced to a fine powder hydrolysis may be caused by the presence of acids introduced into the paper during manufacture for example from the alum used in sizing or from some wet strength resins oxidized cellulose or the acidic hemicelluloses associated with the cellulose in wood and wood pulps contain carboxyl acid groups which are a part of the polysaccharide chain molecules wood contains acetyl groups hydrolysis of these groups in wood or in pulps from which they have not been removed
the nature of paper  introduces additional acidity external sources of acids arise from the atmosphere of urban or industrial areas that may contain sulfur dioxide which is readily oxidized to sulfuric acid and oxides of nitrogen which form nitric acid these atmospheric sources contribute to acid deterioration the extent to which hydrolytic reactions proceed depends upon the amount or concentration of acidic substances originally present in the paper and upon the acids introduced later through oxidation of cellulose and hemicelluloses or through absorption of acidic gases arising from atmospheric contamination the amount of acidic materials in paper introduced subsequent to manufacture may be large in comparison with that originally present the contribution of such acids to deterioration is minimized if the paper contains buffering materials a buffer solution is one which resists change in ph when acids or alkalies are added many papers exhibit a considerable buffering capacity a high buffering capacity can contribute much to stability of paper during aging by partial neutralization of acidic substances formed or introduced deterioration of cellulose by the chemical reactions of oxidation or hydrolysis proceeds more rapidly with increase in temperature there is a rule of thumb and useful approximation among chemists that the rate of a reaction is doubled for each increase in temperature of  c many studies on aging of paper for example  have confirmed the profound effect of temperature and suggest the importance of this factor in the preservation of paper hydrolysis and oxidation generally proceed more rapidly in the presence of moisture paper is hygroscopic and has a moisture content of   percent in equilibrium with relative humidities in the range of about  percent the effect of moisture content during natural aging has not been well established although it has been shown that aging reactions at temperatures in the range of  c are much more rapid in the presence of moisture   deterioration is promoted by the presence of many metallic salts particularly those of iron and copper which are unavoidably introduced in small but measurable amounts during manufacturing processes photochemical degradation that is the degradation produced by light is not important in many uses of paper where prolonged exposure to strong light is not to be expected cellulose is degraded photochemically but lignin is especially subject to deterioration from this source papers containing groundwood are observed to have poor stability upon exposure to light particularly to strong ultraviolet sources prediction of permaence the prediction of permanence is necessary in evaluation of papers for which this property is important the manufacturer needs to determine the probable permanence of his product the user wishes to know whether the paper meets his requirements  any practical predictive test must depend on some accelerated aging test if accelerated aging is to have any predictive validity it is necesary to demonstrate that there is a meaningful and reproducible relationship between such aging and aging under normal conditions an accelerated aging procedure based on heating the paper in an oven
 the library quarterly at circa  c was developed at the swedish government testing institute and at the us bureau of standards in the period     rasch and scribner  considered the heating test seventy two hours at  c as a valid means for estimating the relative aging quality of papers later investigators concluded that accelerated aging under these conditions is empirically equivalent to approximately twenty five years a range of about eighteen to forty eight aging at normal temperatures the oven aging test can be valid only if the reactions leading to deterioration are essentially identical at circa  c and at normal temperatures the profound effect of moisture content on rate of aging   suggests the necessity of taking this factor into account in any case the reactions in question can be only those whose rates are dependent on temperature changes associated with photochemical effects access to atmospheric contaminants and other extraneous factors are not evaluated in oven aging it is necessary to establish that deteriorative reactions proceed in a regular and predictable way as a function of temperature the relation of reaction rate to temperature has been determined for many systems this is the scope of chemical kinetics in the case of chemical reactions which can be studied in a fundamental way it has been shown that a reaction rate is related to the temperature at which the rate is measured the rate constant k at one temperature is described by an appropriate relationship which yields a linear plot of chemical composition versus time of reaction the rate constant k is then used to describe the temperature dependency of reaction rate according to the exponential form of the arrhenius equation k  ae eirt where k  rate constant a  a frequency factor e  the base of the natural system of logarithms   e  activation energy in kilocalories per mole r  the gas constant t  absolute temperature in degrees kelvin degrees centigrade   the arrhenius equation is usually used in its logarithmic form log k  log a  ert for any specific reaction log a and r are considered constant and e is the activation energy which is constant if only one reaction occurs within the temperature range employed hence a plot of logarithm of k versus t will yield a straight line having a slope which is the activation energy e fig  the changes of a paper property for example folding endurance or development of color with time are not determined by any single chemical reaction whose effects can be isolated and controlled hence applications of conventional kinetic treatment of aging data on paper are largely empirical in any case the results of kinetic treatment of data can be undertaken with confidence only if both the rate plots and the arrhenius plots are linear the rate plots for loss of folding endurance are linear or nearly so for many papers if the reaction is treated as first order that is the logarithm of the property is plotted versus time of aging however many papers give nonlinear plots and it is evident that not all papers exhibit the same type
the nature of paper  of behavior  other physical properties for example zero span tensile strength tearing energy have also been plotted according to first order kinetics it appears that this is the most suitable general relationship for these tests but again many rate plots are nonlinear  the development of colored substances during aging is shown by a plot of specific absorption coefficient versus time of aging these plots are also linear for some papers and nonlinear for others if the arrhenius plots log k versus t are linear it becomes possible to extrapolate the relationship obtained upon aging at elevated temperatures and to determine the rate at a specified lower temperature for example  c or  f one can then predict the value of the measured property after any specified time of aging or determine as in the case of folding endurance the time for this to be reduced to one half or other fraction of its original value it has been shown that the arrhenius plots for aging of paper are in fact approximately linear but deviations are large enough that accurate predictions of changes taking place at lower temperatures can be established in only a very approximate manner nevertheless the effect of temperature on aging rates is profound and the relationship found even if only an approximation can be of great service in comparing stability of paper and in estimating rates of deterioration as a function of temperature during storage or aging  interpretation of aging iz  z  w slope  activation energy il    j i t fig relationship of the logarithm of the rate constant and the redprocal of absolute temperature
 the library quarterly data in this way assumes that all factors including moisture content of the paper other than temperature are held constant the relative stability of papers can be expressed by comparing the rates of change rate constants k in physical or other properties with time of aging however a strength property of a paper at any given time depends upon the initial value as well as upon the rate of change for example if two papers change at identical rates indicated by rate constants ki and k in figure  from  the one having the higher initial strength will maintain a higher strength throughout its life two papers may both have high initial strength values designated by rates ki and k in fig  but the one having the higher rate of strength loss k will deteriorate more rapidly than the other k a high initial strength is desirable but alone is not sufficient a paper indicated by rate ks may have lower initial strength than another indicated by rate k but maintain a usable strength for a longer time if it is possible to establish a critical level below which the paper loses its essential utility the information furnished by the rate constants and by this critical level may serve for comparative evaluations of useful life lii ali  z critical level u  time of aging k fig idealized values for rate constants of three papers as determined by accelerated aging references  hunter d papermaking the history and technique of an ancient craft new york alfred a knopf   timell t e molecular weight of native celluloses svensk papperstidning  november      libby c e ed pulp and paper science and technology new york mcgrawhill book co   casey j p pulp and paper chemistry and chemical technology d ed new york interscience publications
