a young adults as problems how the social construction of a marginalized user category occurs mary k chelton two examples of the process of user categorization in professional communication are analyzed to show how marginalization occurs as a direct product of communicative activity in one example of the process on a professional electronic discussion group even while admitting that young adults avoid using the opac and seem uninterested in their information requests the librarian blames them for their own behavior and absolves herself from any responsibility to help them in another example the representation of adolescents as problem users on a journal cover is examined the implications of viewing communication as an explanatory constitutive force that produces librarians understanding of users are discussed communication is primarily viewed within the library and information science lis profession as a means toward an end it is a process for the transfer of information from one person to another or between a system and a person rarely is communication viewed as constitutive that is as the means by which professional understandings of reality are interpreted and produced the following discussion draws on the latter view of communication to show how the constitutive process actually works in two examples that are in direct opposition to professional rhetoric advocating equity of service to users librarians often engage in convenient verbal categorizations to describe and provide service eg adult young adult and children users and nonusers etc and to define different occupational roles eg clerical paraprofessional or professional line and staff public service and technical service etc most of these categorizations are conventional and commonly taken for granted in the field they come under scrutiny only when they are contested such as recent concerns over librarian versus information professional or customer versus patron or user what remains largely unexamined however is not which categorization should be privileged but rather how the process of categorization works by this is meant social categorization through nouns and referents in daily speech as opposed to the formal categorization and classification schemes used in everyday work as librarians since categorization is a basic human communication activity this aspect of categorization and the consequences of its nonconscious enactment warrant further examination especially when it works against stated professional goals goffman suggests that everyone has both a unique individual personal identity as well as a simultaneous categorical identity for example a person may be  volume  number

 journal of education for library and information science providers becoming overly dependent on categorical assessments because of the nature of contemporary service interactions is changing from personal and relational to more anonymous and transactional encounters especially with the increased use of technology in this milieu she suggests that encounters encourage stereotyping by both parties because each has only a single short exposure to the other in contrast relationships  with their history of interaction  gradually allow provider and customer to gain a relatively accurate view of each other this may explain the interactions between librarians and young adult library users in certain library service environments even if neighborhood young adults are repeat users with whom library staff are familiar the after school time and staff constraints may force librarians into the mode of transactional rather than relational encounters in which stereotypical categorizations come into play how categorization worksan e mail example as part of a larger study on adult adolescent service encounters in libraries a query about why adolescents were troublesome was sent to pubyac an internet discussion list for librarians who work with children and young adults in response to that query the following e mail posting came back from a working librarian il be happy to tell you why i find this age group problematic so many come to the reference desk with no idea of why they are there they shove a piece of paper in my face and say this is my homework where can i find this when i ask them what the assignment is they appear to be looking at it for the very first time or they simply mumble i don know it the total lack of concern and the assumption that il figure it all out for them and go fetch the materials that irritates me we have opacs and many of these patrons won even go near them when i ask if theye checked the catalog they reply they don know how to use it they will ask for staples paper directions permission to use the phone but they won ask for help using the opacs they don come to the library for any other purpose than to socialize and bother patrons who have legitimate business in the library wee across the street from a high school at  it is like a parade that crosses the street and enters the library we hired a monitor to do nothing else but keep order in the library when the teenagers are here in contrast to those who won use the opacs are the ones who love to bring a terminal down by screwing around in the dos program we have security features but some have figured this out one will bring it to my attention that a terminal is down then two or three of his friends eagerly wait for me to log back on so they can watch i wise to this i know i sound negative but so many patrons in this age group don need the services of the library or the librarians they simply want a place to hang out until their parents pick them up i love helping a kid find stuff for a tough research project i enjoy taking vague questions and formulating reference questions but having homework assignments and reading lists shoved in my face by healthy intelligent able bodied young people who have no interest in their own homework just plain bugs me several things are going on here the most significant of which is how the librarian creates a marginalized unworthy client category whose behavior is viewed as the cause of the problematic status of the category itself this is classic blaming the victim logic judging volume  number 
young adults os problems  from the above quoted e mail the implied problem as the librarian sees it is that these young adults do not behave according to her standard of a legitimate user since they don know why they are there they appear unconcerned about making themselves understood assuming that she will figure it all out for them won ask for help with the opacs socialize and bother legitimate users necessitate the hiring of a monitor breach opac security features and shove assignments at her one presumes that her idea of a legitimate user would be someone who behaves exactly opposite of the description given the legitimate user is actually the absent totality of the stated description the whole of which is predicated upon an unwritten and unstated standard that the teenagers by definition do not meet by describing what is wrong with them the librarian is simultaneously describing what is right with a different and preferred category of users and attaching a moral judgment to both categories adolescents are bad and post adolescent young adults are good strong also drawing on goffman identifies a similar technique used by doctors in charity pediatrie clinics in scotland as a form of moral work in which parental inadequacy is revealed through a type of discussion of wrong doing termed character work it is notable that the librarian does not denigrate the entire category of adolescent users she also admits that there are exceptions who follow her expected rules i love helping a kid find stuff for a tough research project i enjoy taking vague questions and formulating reference questions this implies that not all kids are unworthy that there is a hierarchical ordering of acceptable behavior in which worthy young people may be contrasted to unworthy young people the worthiness of behavior is related to the librarian inference of what is acceptable in as opposed to out of a library setting thus what jayyusi terms moral matters  standards criteria judgments implications etc  are bound up with various other practical matters  categorizations descriptions inferences etc it is not the case that this relationship is between something called a description or a fact on the one hand and a moral notion or a value on the other hand rather    description and act rests for its character and specifics on moral and other normative standards    the deference deficit another failing of this group as expressed in the librarian perspective is the lack of respect for the librarian herself who obviously expects to be treated like something other than a servant this lack of deference is reciprocated by the librarian assertion that she has nothing that these young people need despite her earlier acknowledgement that several of them admitted not knowing how to use the opac when asked if they had looked there the young people display no sense of social obligation in their demeanor which in turn leads to frustrated expectations on the part of the librarian this interplay is an act of communication that disconfirms the professional self image of the librarian as goffman explains thus rules of conduct transform both action and inaction into expression and whether the individual abides by the rules or breaks them something significant is likely to be communicated the fact that the behavior may well be unintentional on the part of the adolescents is almost irrelevant because the librarian perceives it to be intentional within the context of their interaction it therefore becomes real to her as deetz argues it is on the basis of perceptions winter 
 journal of education for library and information science that human beings make judgments decide courses of action develop feelings and make claims about the nature of reality since the e mail post is exclusively the librarian it is difficult to ascertain intentionality without corroborating data from the adolescents something to be considered in analyzing all library interactions with adolescents however is that because their library related information needs are often imposed by other people such as parents or teachers they have no deep interest in what they are looking for and the rule expecting them to appear interested may seem to them to be either irrelevant or downright silly what is being communicated from their perspective might be construed less as intentional disregard for the librarian and unwillingness to help themselves and more as intentional rebellion against rules of conduct meaningless to them in the first place the librarian may perceive a mere lack of deference when she is actually being confronted with an insurrection goffman says to be pointedly refused an expected act of deference is often a way of being told that open insurrection has begun this may be a way of teenagers claiming their own category for themselves on their own terms as opposed to how adults prefer to define them for such adolescents the reward for rebellion  their deviance from the behavior of the desired type of library user  is the withholding of service justified by the librarian assessment of and imposition of sanctions for their behavior this is a perfect example of how lipsky client control routines work how categorization worksthe representation example in the mayjune  issue of public libraries a feature article entitled managing the problem patron appears with a thematic cover illustration related to it on the cover underneath the name of the journal and the title of the article there is a stylized picture of an angry cursing teenager who is shredding a library book an obviously blaring radio is in one hand and a spilled soda can is seen at his left foot the cover illustration choice is particularly noteworthy because noisy teenagers is listed within the article itself as only one of thirteen types of problem patrons ranging from bathroom habitues to people who tear or scissor library materials on the cover though the teenager has a pair of scissors sticking out of his waistband so it might be surmised that he is representing two problem subcategories as well as the larger problem patron category despite the distinctions made in the text nowhere on the journal cover does the word teenager appear only the highlighted title of the article is juxtaposed with the image of all the thirteen subcategories of problem patrons listed in the article which also includes loud drunks vandals drug users and thieves only the category of noisy teenagers is represented on the cover ironically while the article illustrated by the journal cover does categorize teenagers as problem patrons the author advice in the text to ignore the stereotype that all teenagers in groups are gang members to realize that they lack self confidence and to treat them with humor as individuals is much more sympathetic than the responses that might be invoked by the instantly recognizable cover illustration the question that has to be asked is why this illustration was chosen by the designer and then in turn by the american library association ala graphics staff assuming other choices were available when it directly contradicts the author advice in the text since neither the designer nor the volume  number 
young adults os problems  ala graphics staff may be presumed to be professional librarians but were delegated the responsibility for designing the journal the cover image becomes more interesting because it draws on the stereotype of teenagers already available within the larger culture with this stereotype embodied within the represented image it can easily be invoked by librarian viewers of the image even if it also is representing a different concept that of the problem patron as hall notes representation is the practice of embodying meanings within a symbolic form that evokes and reproduces shared interpretations within particular cultures in representation social reality is not directly experienced but evoked through how it is interpreted by those who hear or see symbolic representations of it many of these meanings are tacit that is they are implied or understood visually without the need for words the choice of the representation of the teenager for the public libraries cover obviously made without consultation with the author of the article who is much more sympathetic to the age group represents tacit knowledge within the profession as much as it represents the teenager as problem patron the cover thus functions simultaneously to evoke knowledge already there and simultaneously to reproduce it regardless of the image and how it portrays adolescents the issue of why noisy teenagers are problem patrons needs to be examined further the rationales for the problem patron categorizations presented by curry in her article include societal changes beyond the control of a librarian or board ease of access and user comfort replacing security concerns user demands for priority service legal and organizational regulations and staff frustration and embarrassment without in any way discounting the seriousness of these issues to those involved with them these rationales function communicatively to justify the rationing of services to users in the categories they create this is exactly the process lipsky calls constructing the client described previously when the text is juxtaposed with the cover illustration however the stereotype of a rowdy teenager is reinforced without ever having asked the question who has the problem here as hall points out stereotypes get hold of the few imple vivid memorable easily grasped and widely recognized characteristics about a person reduce everything about the person to those traits exaggerate and simplify them and fix them without change or development to eternity stereotypes symbolically fix boundaries around individuals and make them unacceptable and stereotyping tends to occur where there are gross inequalities in power with the stereotype directed against the powerless group the power here is symbolic through categorizing and representing adolescents this way they are ritually expelled in hall terms through their classification as deviants information shorthand selection and categorization are basic to perceptual processes in that they provide a means of coping with too little information within a limited amount of time and attention this sorting process helps to provide relevance and meaning to social experiences but as gutek points out can lead to stereotypical assessments on the part of time stressed service providers in increasingly anonymous interaction contexts librarians are not immune to the almost constant negative media barrage about teenagers so when adolescents appear for help in libraries but do not behave in an expected ideal way it becomes much too easy for librarians to winter 
 journal of education for library and information science attribute troublemaker status to them this is particularly true when inferences are drawn from appearance alone even before any suspect behavior is actually observed as gutek suggests despite the fact that encounter providers often attempt to personalize an encounter customers can easily be and often are stereotyped on the basis of their dress race sex and so on because the broad and visible social categories to which customers belong offer the only real basis for making inferences about them for example the librarian above suggests in her e mail that teens repeatedly avoid using the opac or asking her for help using it and that they prefer instead to crash the system to annoy her for their own amusement she also comments that they really do not need the library for legitimate uses rather than address the complicated issues that she herself suggests are significant enough that the behaviors seem to be presented repeatedly  ie avoiding opac use asking for help using the opac and hanging out to wait for rides etc  she writes them off as troublemakers who fall outside some ideal standard legitimacy and stereotyping thus are intertwined for her she does not appear to realize that neither are preordained but rather are socially constructed realities that fly in the face of recent lis research nor does she realize that she could do something about them neuman among others documents the problems adolescents have with online databases  prior knowledge of the subject spelling database syntax etc  all of which are amenable to information literacy instruction thomas in an examination of library environments comments that libraries do not encourage social interaction or even plan for it architecturally implying that the normal social needs of adolescents are guaranteed to frustrate both the young people and the librarians coping with space planning that ignores normal adolescent behavior implications for us education and practice students and practitioners need to understand that the way they talk about and represent users matters far beyond superficial discussions of political correctness because discourse is itself a form of social action that produces and reproduces their understandings of professional reality communication is not just a transfer process but rather a powerful constitutive force in everyday professional life which draws on discourse readily available in the larger culture within which library services reside as such it has the potential to marginalize certain users by assigning them to stereotypical and stigmatized categories which in turn create a reason to ration services to them categories always function conceptually as a means of comparison with other categories often invisible and out of consciousness assigning someone to a prejudicial category has consequences not the least of which is to perpetuate bias and marginalization lis educators might consider asking students to engage in analyses of professional communication this would sensitize them not only to the negative categorization process how it works and is perpetuated but also to the unstated comparison categories embedded in the category assignment so that they do not continue perpetuating it unconsciously once they leave school professional electronic discussion groups and images in professional journals offer many examples for analyses the communicative construction of the mythical ideal user within the work setting as well as the power of the socialization toward this myth that occurs there should become as imporvolume  number
