on community justice and libraries   workable intellectual positions for lis both concepts bear some examination if the cfps goal of greater scholarly attention to the interconnections between libraries information values ethics and human rights is to be critically grounded and serve democratic purposes the article will briefly review the differing positions taken within political theory on both concepts and conclude each section with we will argue the strongest social intellectual and political position for lis research and institutions on community derived from communio the latin word indicating something shared together wallacavage and gruters   community has been viewed through many theoretical and political lenses and is therefore more complex or differentiated than one might initially suspect mara   this ambiguity certainly appears in libraries as a recent article illustrated libraries as community institutions means they must adopt the normative standards of the community presenting all sides of an issue as having equal moral weight is engaging in moral relativism and may not reflect the normative standards of the community library donors and benefactors tend to bring or impose a perspective to the collections and services they underwrite for the receiving community the class perspective of the librarians informs their decisions on how to serve their communities and public funding for libraries implicates the local regional and national political climate jaeger et al  as does tuition it is not difficult to see real political complexity for libraries in the concept of community democratic political theorists who are concerned with the conceptcommunitarianstend to imply different concepts of community each with particular insights and drawbacks for lis four political concepts of communityeach increasingly plausible for liswill be reviewed in order traditional community in terms of historical development organic communitysmall homogeneous villages with deep shared traditions and histories characterized as gemeinschaft by tonnies in  requires that human association occur within a distinct physical space wallacavage and gruters   thus gemeinschaft came later to characterize political and social identities which were spontaneous and prerational like nationsplacing traditional community ties at the core of nationalism stargardt   classic sociological perspectives fleshed out the traditional concept to include association social interaction one or more shared ties and  the differing conceptions of community and justice presented are not hermetically sealed rival theories and the emphasis here will be practical and not on technical philosophical disagreements miller    broadly this article follows the overlapping consensus between christensen and levinson  xxxvi kymlicka   and brint  on the types of community implied by political thinkers concerned with community communitarians and sandel  lebacqz  and konow  on the basic divisions of political conceptions of justice
  the library quarterly importantly an expanded idea of shared space almgren   robert nisbet gave a modern maximal definition suggesting that community is characterized by a high degree of personal intimacy emotional depth moral commitment social cohesion and continuity in time    community is a fusion of feeling and thought of tradition and commitment of membership and volition it may be found in or given symbolic expression by locality religion nation race occupation or crusade quoted in baltzell   traditional ties of community have resulted in a continuum of political outcomes elite political leadership depended on a palpable sense of shared common culture and fate between peasantworker and aristocratbusinessman for hundreds of years it is their separation or dissolution that has been politically alienating de grazia  sennett  it has been manifested where political and economic power are co extensive for instance when corporate leaders serve on local hospital boards or as trustees of universities and the tax revenues of their businesses form a significant basis of municipal budgets sennett   last in eastern europe democratic and communal social relations were given a prominent role in the late twentiethcentury shift to democracy and coming full circle rebuilding national identities brint   common culture virtue and community the individual begins her social journey in the family and broadens her social network to the neighborhood school village city state and nation implying that as the framework community broadens not everyone will be the same a common culture can embrace controversy and difference where there is no established religious tradition nor unity on the provision of basic needs for people but the question then becomes what is the social fabric that would hold individuals together bellah   for these communitarians what holds community together is expressed in a continuum of ideas about common culture the need for a moral basis for    sharing combined with the idea of and the need for commitment to the common good sandel   the common good is that which serves all members of a given community with community basically a major common good in itself characterized as some commitment to a core of shared values norms and meanings as well as a collective history and identityin short a particularistic moral culture providing informal social controls etzioni   while at the same time maintaining the sacredness of individual consciencea near religious and political ideal to be prized and nurtured bellah  the more overtly political direction taken by these communitarians posits that communities are interdependent and citizenship must be fostered free democratic communities depend on mutual responsibility and    rights without obligations are ultimately not sustainable  the question of whether or not community can be achieved virtually is a hotly debated issue simply calling something a community does not mean that it provides its members with the same benefits that earlier less technological forms of community have providedcertainly the case within the political framework adopted here christensen and levinson  xl see also winner  ellis oldridge and vasconcelos  coll 
on community justice and libraries   barber and battistoni   a common element implied by this continuum is the requirement and the nurturing of virtue mutual responsibility a moral culture and a commitment to the common good that requires depending on the communitarian a range of virtues from the moral to the civic the point is that good politics in a democracy inherently relies on good people and the political and cultural forms that contribute to human flourishing mara   because when politics goes well we can know a good in common that we cannot know alone sandel   thus communitarians give traditional community a civic and more inclusive inflection while retaining clear ties to it community as social capital this form of community is conducted through religious civic and other types of associational groups and refers to features of social organizations such as networks norms and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit putnam   this view of community is strongly rooted in alexis de tocquevilles observations on democracy in america in the s nothing in my view deserves more attention than the intellectual and moral associations in america quoted in putnam   thus the erosion of associational membership has resulted in the decline of social capital and community explanations include  the increase of women in the labor force which does not permit them to participate as actively in organizations like womens clubs  mobility requiring time for those who have moved to put down roots and then subsequent uprootings  demographic changes to the american family such as the decline in marriages and children more frequent divorce and lower real wages and  technological domination of leisure time encouraging more individualized experiences rather than more active personally involved engagement that brings people together in a common physical space civic engagement in contrast is commonly conducted by those who are stable married middleclass parents putnam   the unsettled nature of communal bonds in situations of geographic marital and social mobility results in uncertainty in the inherited beliefs and ways of community political mobilitya more independent more volatile electorate results in institutional instability particularly at the local level where political organization once served to reinforce communal ties walzer   these communitarians explicitly oppose the economic disruption of local communities factories moving big box stores hollowing out downtowns and voice concern for the displacement of politics from smaller forms of association to more comprehensive ones sandel  gutmann   long standing problems with communitarianism and an institutional focus for community the dangers of traditional community are clear and well known generally they are manifested in varieties of intolerance severe restrictions on individual freedoms and expression
  the library quarterly routine and strong enforcement of conformity creating deviance an outside to foster cohesiveness on an inside and outright prejudice brint   at its worst community becomes religiously and ethnically exclusive with murderous results the communitarians bland and uncontroversial idea that man is a social animal does not necessarily justify the modern and highly controversial conclusion that warm and solidaristic social order is morally obligatory holmes quoted in brint  or politically healthy there is no question that the theorists reviewed here wish to surmount these problems and for community to become variously inclusive when members of a society have settled roots and established traditions they will tolerate the speech religion sexual and associational preferences of minorities they claim gutmann   but to simply assume that the historical exclusion of certain groups    was just arbitrary so that we can now include them and proceed forward is highly problematic kymlicka   to illustrate communitarians have focused a great deal of attention on the proliferation of diversity and fragmentation in society and framed these developments as problematic mistrust grows out of suspicions that ones fellow citizens are too fragmented in their value orientations and dont share an understanding of the common good mara   this implicitly if not always intentionally fosters some of the forms of intolerance noted the more neutral social capital model toggles between the instrumentality of mutual benefit and entangling itself with traditionalism by raising doubts about the increased role rights and mobility of women in combination with an emphasis on shared space but the problems go further joshua cohen  focuses on the problem of the shared emphasis of the communitarians variously values commitments the common good and so on people share these for a variety of reasons genuine support or belief fear lack of interest self interest lack of alternativesa set of diverse values and ambitions lie behind their decisions thus we cannot assume a common and coherent set of ideas or values in support of a political or social action cohen    the communitarians smother this diversity of reasons under concepts such as shared or common ends thus lacking an account of internal diversity the pacifist in a society at war or the atheist in a society of believers alternatively as cohen suggests when there truly is a consensus of coherent values    it is conservative   social and political change seemingly must set their face against community with community only belatedly absorbing those changes it is these very problemsinherent exclusion creating an outside or others a smothering uniformitythat lis presumably would wish to avoid in its institutions and practices but when ala kniffel  claims that libraries break down boundaries value the individual support families return high dividends and sustain democracy and build communities we can see from even this brief review that some of those claims conflict or imply outcomes not intended nothing is purely neutral but lis would be on more solid ground if it conceptualized and committed to a more neutral concept of community to be fostered there is a
on community justice and libraries   strain of communitarian thought that guides us in this direction to begin michael walzer  does not believe that the factors militating against community have moved us so far apart that we can no longer talk with one another  and that is key because democracies work better when there is mutual commitment and familiarity they can slip into exclusion to avoid this will require negotiation and creative compromise between peoples who have to or want to live together under the same political roof taylor a  see also taylor b  democracy obliges us to show much more solidarity and much more commitment to one another in our joint political project than was demanded in societies of yesteryear and for this to occur decisions fostered by deliberation and exchange are required implied is a cohesiona willingness to listen to one another to understand one anotherthat is core to the community libraries wish to foster taylor a  john dewey suggests that this cooperative coping is enhanced by the good democratic state and he notes that it renders the desirable association solider and more coherent quoted in walzer   institutions can be the carriers of a powerful common culturea point made by a variety of political theorists cohen  bellah  paulsen  the concept posited here is different institutions are sites at which individuals actually encounter the structures of the wider society pawley   meaning on the ground entities such as schools universities and libraries these institutions can be places of social and legal relationships which will best promote a mature and responsible neighborliness appropriate to an urban bureaucratized and rational rather than local and patriarchal social order baltzell   amy gutmann   notes that new institutions such as citizen review boards in areas such as health care education and community development have increased interest in democratic participation fostering communal political values in the process likewise librariesthe collections services and spaces they provideare an often overlooked but key site for the kinds of cooperative coping including investigation inclusion local and democratic guidance common space and conversation that democracies rely upon to function and libraries foster often as a matter of course it is this political vision of communityone that puts conversation inclusion and democracy at its core rather than tradition solidarity and affective bondsthat makes the most practical sense for lis to promote and it avoids many though not all of the pitfalls of other versions of community having reviewed concepts of community and made the case for its institutional locus we will see some affinities with differing political concepts of justice as the article reviews four varieties with the preferred version presented last  political theorists tend to use this term to connote the basic structures of society such as major institutions such as the political system and constitutional arrangements arneson   in contrast if democratic political culture    plays a constitutive role for democratic societies and their functioning then community is key and institutionsas we mean the termhave a role in fostering it mara   see also   gutmann 
  the library quarterly on justice if there is any political concept even more varied than community it is justice let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream amos  justice is the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due justinian quoted in miller   down to the modern witty and irreverent injustice is relatively easy to bear what stings is justice mencken quoted inwebsters  the observations on what it is and is not and why we seek it or not are a constant theme of reflection and expression in the broadest terms we come together in communities and societies for the purpose of living in justice for protection safety in our homes and possessions a certain amount of predictability in our conduct of life wide observation of the laws and enforcement of contracts wolin     thankfully within that very broad context political conceptions of justice have over the long run tended to fall into roughly four broad groupings though who belongs in what grouping tends to shift according to perspective the descriptions that follow are of course necessarily foreshortened equality the first most primitive and probably oldest notion of justice is equality konow   from simple early communal ideas of share and share alike through christian charity both with affinities to traditional community some versions of marxism and theories of progressive taxation and social justice the preferred solution is the one with the most equal distribution of the goods which are to be distributed olsen   see also lebacqz  konow  a contemporary variant elevates the equality of gender and other forms of identity along with the freedom to pursue a variety of plural individual identities as core to democratic justice now connelly  young  the good to be distributed in this case is self respect and the freedom from the normalizing pressures of society in support of selfrealization the cases against equality are classic from the greeks to jefferson to tocqueville only equal power is true equality which now equates to equal wealth and media access the powerful are always privileged and people are naturally and always unequal they have innately different levels of talent and interests and conversely true equality can be stifling and hegemonic with its affinity to the critique of traditional community buschman  utility utilitarianism provides a set of simple core tenets to define justice policies rules or laws are to be judged    in terms of    the best consequences doyle   best consequences being the greatest possible balance of good over bad where good is understood to mean  john rawls   is helpful here the goods are not necessarily commodities or cash though they can be but rather social primary goodsliberty and opportunity income and wealth and the bases of self respect

  the library quarterly appear conceptually of a piece with the constraints of bare nature because the market is the institutional form proper to human nature levine quoted in lauder   critics point out that this is an economic theory of justice and elite democracy reliant on a passive citizenry and reductive of politics to competitions for economic goods effectively making real politics disappear mara   these critiques point to affinities with the more instrumental side of social capital socially and politically realized forms of justice are de facto ruled out and at the same time the common culture values and habits communitywhich underwrite the stable economic order soughtconstitute a blind spot    because the market economy is the only visible part gray   see also buschman  fairness rawls reimagined the social contract directly challenged the long standing dominance of utilitarian understandings of justice and single handedly revived anglo american political theory his theory dominates contemporary debates not because everyone accepts it but because the alternative views are best understood in terms of their relationship to rawls kymlicka   see also arneson  in concert with the view of community we have put forward rawls brings an institutional focus to justice he holds that just institutions distribute primary social goods fairly arneson   and further that political institutions    can generate a just society and not the other way around very much affecting what we regard as justice collective identity belonging trust and solidarity rothstein   in other words rawls is a powerful advocate of the idea that what libraries and other educative institutions do and how they do it in a given community is meaningful in a democracy rawls  xxv xvii attempts to give us an answer to the question what are the fair terms of social cooperation between    free and equal citizens profoundly divided by reasonable though incompatible religious philosophical and moral doctrines so that all affirm the political conception of a constitutional regimea compelling question at this point in history his system of thought tries to capture moral ethical content but does so in a way that avoids the drawbacks of communitarianism such as the sectarian foundations that have caused so much havoc in history accepting the inevitability of pluralism and the value of democracy as mutually reinforcing rawls  xiiilx  in other words rawlss justice represents a kind of middle path to democratic purposes for the library as a public institution a thorough summary is not necessary here to illustrate the value of his work and there are already many excellent precis available rather the focus will be on some core concepts and thought  for instance the renewal of communitarianism and the neoliberalism of nozick are direct responses to rawls young   see rawls    and arneson 
on community justice and libraries   devices and his conclusions which lis can draw upon without doing too much violence to the coherence of his thinking for rawls  justice is the first virtue of social institutions as truth is of systems of thought  in other words justice is social and publicnot the product of moral reasoning based in a religious or philosophical doctrine but before we get to justice and how he reestablished it in a novel way society must be defined and have a basis a self sufficient association of persons who in their relations to one another recognize rules of conduct as binding    since social cooperation makes possible a better life for all than any would have if each were to live solely by his own efforts in spite of inevitable differences and conflicts of interest rawls   justice for rawls is famously fairness a society arranged as a fair system of cooperation meant to produce in addition each participants rational advantage and reciprocity   his reimagining of the social contract gives the content and controversy to justice as fairness how are the fair terms of social cooperation to be determined are those terms the product of an outside authority or god or recognized as required by natural law rawls   all are bases that have caused considerable historical conflict as noted justice and fairness as the basis of the social contract are the fair terms    agreed to by those engaged in it and to achieve this rawls seeks some point of view removed from and not distorted by    bargaining advantages of the everyday interests and concerns of persons and the advantages and accidental influences from the past   under such circumstances people would truly be free and equal to set social rules his solution was an ingenious and controversial thought experiment the social contract tradition broadly posited different theses that society exists to prevent violence and ensure safety hobbes  to realize freedom in a complex society within the general will rousseau  or out of consent to protect property locke  in contrast rawls asks what would be the conditions under which we would form society to which we could all assent it would be a bargain that is fair rational and mutually disinterested    conceived as not taking an interest in one anothers interests and avoiding introducing into it any controversial ethical elements as the basis of principles it would be rational to adopt    it should be impossible to tailor principles to the circumstances of ones own case rawls   this then is the original positionthe neutral stage for negotiating social rules and the social contract the device to achieve this is the veil of ignorance constructed in order to bracket those things that are irrelevant from the standpoint of justice for example if a man knew that he was wealthy he might find it rational to advance the principle that    taxes for welfare measures be counted unjust if he knew he was poor he would most likely propose the contrary principle    one imagines a situation in which everyone is deprived of this sort of information one excludes the knowledge of those contingencies which sets
  the library quarterly men at odds and allows them to be guided by their prejudices    together    these conditions define the principles of justice as those which rational persons concerned to advance their interests would consent to as equals when none are known to be advantaged or disadvantaged by social and natural contingencies rawls   in other words we would set fair terms and rules if we had no idea where we fell in the social and economic spectruma situation rawls freely acknowledges as nonhistorical    from this rawls  draws two principles of justice each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all and social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both to the greatest benefit to the least advantaged within reasonable limits inheritance is not unjust with offices and positions    open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity  it follows that racial religious or economic discrimination would be ruled outthey would be unfair and an irrational bargain since we would not know beforehand if we were in the minority or poor when we were negotiating the rules and institutions are to foster the virtue of justice and to discourage desires and aspirations incompatible with it rawls   such institutions are to be distributiveor redistributiveof primary social goods specifically ensuring a certain fair equality of opportunity especially in education and training and the fostering of public deliberation    for a reasonable constitutional regime and specific institutions and arrangements    to be laid down to support and encourage it rawls  lvii clearly there are affinities here with the deliberative community sought through institutions outlined earlier there are many philosophical disagreements with rawls arneson  but two practical critiques are of note here michael sandel  calls the inhabitants of his thought experiment unencumbered selves mythical people standing apart from their values aims ambitions and identities for him this is not merely implausible but socially freighted in unacceptable ways sheldon s wolin  argues that rawlsian justice and politics generate quiescence strongly supportive of a very unequal economic and political status quo there are certainly more activist stances within democratic theory that point lis toward more progressive goals buschman  but in response rawls    states clearly that he wants to make explicit the implicit in the public political culture of a democratic society and continuing public discussion when shared understandings of lesser generality have broken down rawls situates and justifies what lis stands for within the realm of justice to be open to all in the community and beyond to share resources to meet needs to meet all needs within reasonable limits to equalize resourcesand therefore opportunityand to set up an infrastructure to realize these goals in an age of political polarization such a neutral conception rooted in justice appears at a different point in the political spectrum of contemporary democracy shifted as it has so far to the right the goal is a society in which an
