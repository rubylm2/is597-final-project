children and youth are important users of the public library system howard a and in recent years libraries have employed systematic efforts to boost in particular the participation of children and youth in library programming jones and waddle  rothbauer walter and weibel  in part these efforts respond to research findings suggesting that youth use of the public library is relatively low with estimates indicating that about one third of youth visit the library only one or fewer times in a given year howard a investigating how and why children and teens use public library services has been identified as an important focus for library research walter  although some work has been conducted on this topic eg walter and markey  howard a there is still little known about characteristics of children and youth who do and alternatively who do not elect to participate in library based programs as the data typically collected by public library systems tend to be restricted to general program outputs eg the number of youth who sign up for various programs the number of youth who complete a given program despite pressure from external agencies for institutional accountability over the past decade to expand outputs to include user outcome data collection measures howard b lance et al  the more defining characteristics of those served still need to be examined for instance it is not clear whether the children and youth who elect to participate in public library programming are those who are highly motivated to read or perhaps are more capable readers than children and youth who do not participate results of a recent survey of canadian teens n   perceptions of the public library did suggest that youth who made little or no use of the public library few if any visits over a year tended to be less active readers than youth who used the library more often walter and markey  howard a findings such as these as rare as they are in the library sciences literature suggest the importance of learning more about the children and youth who do elect to participate in public library programming the purpose of the study reported here was to further our understanding of the characteristics of children and youth who elect to participate in library based programming focusing our efforts on one of the most common library based programs the summer reading club src literature review srcs are particularly useful to study as they not only are one of the most ubiquitous library programs available to children and youth but also are intended to provide an important mechanism for boosting reading achievement among american children and youth offering a resource for maintaining or improving reading activities within the summer months when school is out of session at present despite the implementation of numerous efforts to improve reading achievement among american children and youth about one in three students cannot read at even very basic levels according to the national center for education statistics nces  these data show that children in the united states do not generally fare well with respect to reading and that some subgroups of children are particularly disadvantaged for instance about  percent of black and hispanic fourth graders do not read at basic levels as compared to  percent of white students fourth graders who scored below the th percentile on this national assessment of reading were likely to be poor  percent received freereduced lunch at school research on how public library programs can be used to promote the reading achievement and activities of children and youth is a welcome complement to research on reading programs implemented within public schools to date very few if any school reform efforts have been able to address the problem of summer learning loss or the summer slide which refers to the well documented decline in reading achievement that occurs during summer vacation borman and boulay  in general american youth spend about three weeks less on average in school as compared to their international counterparts which makes summer learning loss a uniquely american issue wiseman and baker  community based summer reading programs such as those offered in library settings referred to as srcs in this article warrant special attention for their potential to stem summer learning loss by increasing children and youth participation in reading activities over the months of summer there is little doubt that srcs are a valuable community resource as shown by the large number of participants in these programs nationally balsen and moore  however there is little scientific evidence showing that srcs do in fact exert their intended positive impacts on promoting children and youth reading achievement and reducing summer learning loss that is while there have been some recent attempts to investigate the impact of summer reading programs there are many anecdotes and overly stated findings in the literature related to the importance and effects of such programs eg roman carran and fiore  celano and neuman  lyons  as few if any carefully controlled studies of srcs have been conducted that permit causal inferences to be made regarding effects several recent experimental studies have sought to determine whether summer reading programs do have positive impacts on children and youth but all of these have involved school based programs developed and tested by researchers not programs implemented by public libraries in such programs students typically do not choose to participate rather their caregivers consent for them to participate in the larger research activity that involves intact classes or grades of students thus the characteristics of children and youth in these studies and their reasons for participating in such summer programs are possibly quite different from library based summer reading clubs nonetheless findings from such works are relevant to consider the studies by james s kim and colleagues kim   kim and white  kim and guryan  involving in total about  first through fifth graders have experimentally tested the effects of summer reading programs in which students received one book per week over an eightor ten week program programs were implemented in students schools just prior to summer vacation in all studies the reading attitudes activities and achievement of students participating in the summer programs were compared against those of students randomly assigned to a control condition delayed treatment in which the program was implemented later in the fall although this body of work suggests that participation in summer reading programs improved students reading activities those in the program tended to read more than those not in the program none of the studies showed a positive effect of summer reading programs on students reading achievement moreover these studies generally focused on high risk children and youth who do not wholly represent the patronage of library based srcs empirical research that improves our understanding of summer reading programs including study of who accesses these programs and why is very limited the research described above by kim and colleagues represented experimental summer reading programs implemented in public schools and their programs differed in important ways from those available within libraries for instance the children studied by kim et al were in select grades largely first through fifth grade participants in library based srcs represent a much broader range to serve infants through adults an additional distinction between library based srcs and the school based reading programs studied by kim and colleagues is that participants in srcs self select into such programs they must enroll independently visit the library on their own to select books and track their own reading activities for young children it is possible that primary caregivers may be the ones electing to enroll a src participant however in such instances the childs caregiver is electing to enroll a child in the src which would not likely be the case for a school based reading program given such features of srcs we might expect that the children and youth who elect to participate in these programs exhibit certain characteristics that lead them to select into such programs for instance the children and youth who participate in srcs might be very motivated to read andor may be particularly good readers at the same time they might live in homes in which reading activities are prioritized nonetheless it is important to point out that for srcs to have their maximum impact it would be ideal if they also elicited participation of children and youth who are not particularly motivated to read and who may need practice reading because they struggle in this area this study was conducted to improve our understanding of who participates in library based srcs as well as why they participate as research findings have shown only a minority of youth visits the public library often howard a and we might also presume that only a minority of children and youth elects to participate in srcs who are these youngsters and what motivates them to take advantage of this important community resource to address this question we sought to learn more about the children and youth ages birth to seventeen years who enrolled in a src available in the public library system within a large urban midwest community with a well established src with respect to learning about more about who participates we purposefully select two sets of characteristics regarding children and youth to examine namely basic demographics and home environment for the formerdemographic characteristicswe examined children and youth with respect to their age gender raceethnicity caregiver educational attainment as an index of socioeconomic status home language and perceived reading competence each of which has been shown in prior research to be associated with reading achievement andor reading activity among children and youth eg mckenna and kear  nces  for the latterhome environmentwe examined three features of childrens households caregiver expectations home atmosphere and literacy environment our focus on these three features of childrens households was motivated as follows first caregiver expectations are considered one of the most important features of the home environment with respect to childyouth academic achievement caregiver expectations refer to the manner and extent to which caregivers communicate their aspirations regarding their childrens academic performance and educationally related future outcomes eg participation in postsecondary schooling there is strong evidence showing that high caregiver expectations are associated with improved academic achievement among children and youth fan and chen  second the home atmosphere refers to the overall patterns of a household in terms of predictability and organization homes are considered chaotic when routines are unpredictable disorderly and disorganized and such household patterns are associated with underachievement in reading among children johnson et al  third the literacy environment of the home refers to the extent to which literacy related materials eg books magazines are available within a childs home and how often these are used by children and adults frijters barron and brunello  the home literacy environment is particularly influential to the early reading development of young children under age seven as children at these ages are not participating in formal reading instruction and thus typically rely on home literacy resources to facilitate their early reading skills with respect to learning more about why child and youth elect to participate in src we also selected several characteristics of children and youth to study related to motivation the impact of youth motivation and reading attitudes on their reading achievement petscher  coupled with the fact that reading attitudes tend to decline significantly from the elementary grades into high school mckenna kear and ellsworth  has challenged researchers to better understand how motivation might elicit more participation in reading activities by children and youth in this study we examined children and youth participating in src using expectancy value theory as a framework expectancy value theory eccles  wigfield and eccles   explains that motivation to complete a task is driven by two internal forces the belief that one can achieve the goal expectancy and how much successfully completing the task is worth to them task value a student with high expectancy for success or a high value placed on the task will theoretically be more motivated to engage in the activity we also looked at other possible motivational reasons for engaging in reading in particular extrinsic motivation stimulates participation because of a tangible reward generally external motivators can have strong negative effects on reading attitudes and achievement while extrinsic motivators can lead to a short term outcome eg paying a child to clean her room these do not typically change behaviors over the long term eg upon cleaning her room the child is not motivated to continue keeping her room clean in the long term as there is no intrinsic value to the task on the contrary intrinsic motivators can lead to long term changes in behavior as an individual is motivated to engage in a task because it is internally satisfying and rewarding allan wigfield and john t guthrie  provide a detailed discussion of how intrinsic and extrinsic motivators are tied to literacy outcomes many schools and libraries use extrinsic motivators to promote youths participation in reading activities as a way to boost achievement however there may be other reasons why students participate or options for enticing participation we thus sought to learn the reasons for children and youth participation in src the study setting and participants this descriptive study was conducted during the summer of  as part of the columbus ohio metropolitan librarys cml summer reading club columbus is the largest city in ohio population of about  and the state capital according to us census data it is a racially and ethnically diverse city with  percent of the population white  percent black and  percent of latinohispanic descent  percent of households speak a language other than english it is also a relatively educated city with  percent of adults having a high school diploma and  percent holding a bachelors degree the cmls summer reading club is one of the largest and longest continually running programs of its kind and is an established part of the columbus metropolitan community in the year prior to the study year about  children and youth participated in the club which is a no cost voluntary eight week self reported reading program that began in  to participate persons register online by a specified date or in person at any one of the twenty one local branches of cml once registered through a local library each of the participants receives a reading record that features a game board with twelve circles the participant earns spaces by spending time reading once the participants have read for an hour they can fill in one of the circles and receive a sticker each circle represents one hour of reading at specific intervals four hours eight hours and twelve hours participants reflect on their reading by answering a question and this earns tangible prizes the participants visit the local library to receive their prizes it should be noted that enrollment in src does not necessarily constitute active participation or completion of the program the cml like some other library systems tracks participation through a proxy system associated with the collection of the prizes because of the sheer volume of participants in the cmls src across its twenty one branches we purposefully selected five branches of the library  percent of branch locations in which to embed this study the five branches were selected to provide a representative subset of locations from which findings could adequately generalize to the larger cml organization and ideally to libraries across the nation in selecting these five branches the following procedures were followed first the main library was included as it is the flagship of the organization and serves a large number of children and youth from the inner city core eg nearly  childrenyouth participated in the  summer reading club second additional sites were selected to capture a one suburban branch b one urban branch and c two mixed branches to select these sites each cml branch was coded as suburban urban or mixed sitting between the urban core and suburbs administrators within the cml were consulted to ensure the accuracy of these typology designations after establishing typologies for each cml branch the additional four branches were selected in the following way for the suburban branch of which there are four in total the branches were rank ordered based on the number of persons who participated in the  summer reading club we then selected a branch at the th percentile in terms of numbers served for participation in the study for the urban branch of which there are seven in total sites were similarly rank ordered and a branch at the th percentile in terms of participants was selected finally for the mixed branches of which there are nine the same procedure was followed to select two branches all of the five branches selected for participation agreed to implement the study activities during implementation of the  src participation restriction to one large metropolitan library system also served to help control for some of the known variations in src programs that exist across the country such as differences in the quality or quantity of reward incentives or the amount of reading expected procedures the primary study activity employed in this research was collection of a comprehensive intake questionnaire by participants upon registration for the summer  src at one of the five branches selected for involvement administration of the questionnaire was implemented in a two week registration window within which the majority of src participants self enroll at the start of the summer program although participants are permitted to enroll prior to the official start and can continue to enroll for several weeks for the purposes of this study we only solicited study participants during a fourteen day period to administer the questionnaire the following procedures were employed by public library staff first completion of the study questionnaire was solicited only from persons enrolling in person in the src at a targeted branch location persons who enrolled in the src via online processes were not candidates for this study as we elected for library staff to discuss in person the questionnaire with potential participants those eligible were between the ages of birth and seventeen years for the birth to seven year old registrants caretakers were asked to complete the questionnaire on behalf of their children whereas those registering who were between the ages of eight and seventeen years were asked to complete the questionnaire on their own second completion of the questionnaire was solicited only from persons following completion of the initial standard src enrollment procedures this procedure was followed so that completion of the questionnaire was considered to be discretionary upon the registrant and not a requirement of enrollment to solicit completion of the questionnaire children and youth or the caregivers of those seven years and under were asked to consider completing a questionnaire so that cml could learn more about those who elect to participate in the src tracking of those declining to participate in the study was not collected by the libraries those who agreed to do so were provided a paper version of the questionnaire or were able to complete the questionnaire online contingent upon a librarys computer availability the number of questionnaires completed online versus on paper was not tracked however based on feedback from senior library personnel a shortage of computers across library sites resulted in the majority of the questionnaires being hand entered postadministration following data collection the two age band preand postquestionnaires were exported into excel comma delimited files and subsequently spss analyses of the data for the present purposes were approved by the universitys internal review board measures the primary measure required for this research was a questionnaire developed from extant sources to examine the following characteristics of children and youth demographics age gender raceethnicity caregiver educational attainment home language and perceived reading competence home environment caregiver expectations home atmosphere and literacy environment and motivation task value and reasons for participating two parallel forms of the study questionnaire were generated one to be completed by caregivers of children between the ages of birth and seven years and the other to be completed by children and youth ages eight and older the former questionnaire completed by caregivers had several items related to the home environment that were excluded from the latter questionnaire for reasons discussed below demographics the questionnaire included seven items focused on age gender raceethnicity caregiver educational attainment five categories ranging from did not complete high school to attended graduate school for both the mother and the father home language and perceived reading competence the latter included to represent participants perceptions of their own reading abilities which could not be directly assessed was measured by two items childrenyouth or their caregivers were asked to respond to the statements how good are you is your child at reading and compared to other studentschildren how well do you expect your child to do in reading next year based on a five point scale   not at all good   very good for the first item   much worse than other students   much better than other students the items were drawn from an established measure designed to capture children and adolescents values and motivation related to reading and achievement eccles and wigfield  home environment five items related to the home environment were included on the questionnaire completed by those eight and older as well as an additional seven items for those completed by caregivers of younger children caregiver expectations regarding their children and youth were assessed using three items drawn from prior research by sharon e paulson  on parental involvement the childyouth or caregiver statements eg my primary caregiver thinks that getting ahead in life is important were responded to on a five point scale   never   always home atmosphere was addressed using two items drawn from a well validated questionnaire that examines the extent to which a home environment is orderly versus chaotic matheny et al  the childyouth or caregiver responded to each statement eg the atmosphere in my house is calm on a five point scale   definitely not true   definitely true finally the literacy environment of homes was examined using seven items these were included only in the caregiver questionnaire completed for children between birth and seven years enrolling in the src the literacy environment of the home environment is influential to young childrens literacy growth until the time they enter school at which time the environment of the school becomes more influential for these items caregivers were asked to respond to one item indicating the approximate number of books owned by the child  books        or more as well as six questions about specific home literacy activities eg how often does a family member read a book to the child on a frequency estimation scale    hardly ever   once or twice a month   once or twice a week   once a day and   two or more times a day that were adapted from the literacy habits measure paris et al  motivation eight items related to the task value of the expectancy value theory motivation were included on the questionnaire completed by those eight and older with seven of these same items included on the questionnaire completed by caregivers of younger children three components of task value motivation were measured using items adapted from eccles and wigfield  two items measured intrinsic interest eg how much do you does your child like reading on a five point scale from   not very much to   very much three items measured attainment utility eg how important is it to you to your child to get good grades do well in reading on a five point scale from   not worthwhile at all to   very worthwhile and either one or two items measured extrinsic utility how useful is reading to your childs life when not in school on a five point scale of   not useful at all to   very useful with the second item how useful is reading for what you want to do after you graduate on a five point scale of   not worthwhile at all to   very worthwhile included only on the questionnaire completed by those eight and older an item asking students why they signed up for src was also included childrenyouth or their caregivers were invited to select all applicable reasons from a list that included enrolling to get the prize enrolling to practice reading enrolling due to parental encouragement enrolling due to school encouragement to sign up and fulfilling a school requirement this item identified possible extrinsic motivators results who participates

library trends released by the institute of museum and library services imls in october of  based on  findings indicated that public library visits totaled  billion with  billion in circulations of library materials about one third of circulations involved childrens materials indicating that children are active constituents in public library programming miller et al  moreover for communities that receive library services these data indicate that the total number of childrens program attendance for fiscal year  was  per  of the population miller et al  these library patronages circulation and other aggregate information outputs pertaining to libraries while important to documenting and informing policy still leave a significant gap in the library science research literaturenamely our understanding of the defining characteristics of communities families and children who are served by public libraries for example according to the american library associations january  harris poll conducted by telephone within the united states there was an  percent net agreement among the  adults age eighteen or older that the public library is important to their familys education ala  while the  poll does not provide additional details related to how the library contributes to a perceived level of importance public libraries have historically supported literacy and education through children and youth services programs eg after school homework centers book clubs and summer reading programs the collection of library inputs or the quantification of a librarys raw materials or potential to meet user needs and outputs actual use of library services and collections will be substantially enriched with findings from research investigations that collect more user and defining user information through a collaborative partnership between researchers at a land grant university and the public library recipient of the  national medal for museum and library service award this study contributes a unique and expanded understanding of the characteristics of children and youth who elect to participate in library based programming namely the summer reading program findings of this work suggest that children and youth who participate in srcs tend to like reading or being read to value the effort needed to become advanced readers and hold a belief that reading is important the children and youth also tend to reside in homes in which their primary caregiver has high expectations for their future and hold a belief that getting ahead in life is always important in addition the majority of the participants find it easy to get to a library enjoy attending summer reading club and definitely anticipate going to src next year finally the participants largely seem to elect to participate because they value reading and the opportunity to practice reading over the summerand not the extrinsic motivators they receive as part of participating consequently the findings suggest that provision of special rewards and materials to participantssuch as prizes and certificatesmay not be particularly crucial for attracting children and youth to summer reading clubs such data provide us the opportunity to draw inferences about children and youth who are participating in summer reading clubs across the united states and at least tentatively so about those children and youth who are not electing to participate in such programs and thus might be targeted through special enrollment activities before making such inferences we do want to note that these should be interpreted with caution regarding the first inferencegeneralizing our findings to those of the broader population of children and youthwe must point out that not all participants in the targeted src elected to complete our questionnaire it might be that the children and youth who completed the study questionnaire differed in important ways from the larger population of children and youth enrolling in this src while employing a representative subset of the columbus metropolitan library locations permits these findings to be adequately generalized to the larger cml organization there may still be unique characteristics related to participants who self selected to participate in this study for example perhaps the willing participants had a higher degree of reading confidence and motivation that influenced participation because the library system involved in this study does not have defining data on the population of children and youth who participate in the src with respect to raceethnicity socioeconomic status ses and other variables examined in this study we cannot ensure that our findings appropriately generalize we note this as a limitation of this study at the same time using our data to make inferences about who does not participate in srcs also presents some limitations to learn about children and youth who do not elect to participate in srcs would involve wholly different methods than those used here and would present a special set of challenges however because there is a good deal in the extant literature about some of the variables investigated in the present study we can make some reasonable inferences first with respect to gender there was an overrepresentation of females  percent among the youth who participated in the src in the united states there are  males per  females under eighteen years of age us bureau of the census b thus it appears that males are underrepresented among youth who participate in the src which is aligned with other research showing that males may be less motivated to read than females wigfield and guthrie  second about  percent of the children enrolling in the src came from low ses households based on maternal education household in which primary female caregiver has high school as highest level of education in the state of ohio in which this study was conducted about  percent of children under eighteen years of age reside in low ses households these data suggest that children from low ses homes may be adequately represented in src programming us bureau of the census a third the vast majority of children and youth enrolled in the src perceived themselves to be good readers yet about one third of children are characterized as poor readers based on national estimates nces  suggesting that good readers may be overrepresented and the level of reading proficiency may be overestimated among participants in src this is one of the risks of using self reported data finally not all caregivers have high expectations for their childrens future fan and chen  yet the children and youth in this study came primarily from homes in which their caregivers had very strong aspirations for their future thus we might speculate that children in homes in which caregivers hold high aspirations for their children are overrepresented among src participants obviously our speculations are not particularly surprising to participate in a src involves effort and interest and as such it likely attracts participants who are motivated to read and who are good at the task these motivated reading characteristics are also in keeping with a recent pew library project report of library card patrons age sixteen and older having more engaged reading characteristics zickuhr  a great challenge for public library programs is ensuring that children youth and families who might not characterize the typical participant have the opportunity and interest to participate expanding participation would be particularly important if srcs are to help stem the summer learning slide experienced by children and youth who may be less motivated or have less home support to read or otherwise focus on literacy during the summer months indeed while findings from this study reflect that prize incentives were not the primary reason for src participation this may not be the case for poor readers as libraries systematically explore ways to bring src to all children and youth and not only those particularly motivated or equipped to participate collaborative research studies such as this may help launch conversations that inform programming and policy decisions related to youth services there are several key limitations of the present study that present some important directions for future research first it is unclear whether results can generalize beyond the type of src studied and the community in which this work was conducted a larger scale study that looks more broadly at child and youth participation in srcs of various types and in numerous locations would make a compelling contribution to the literature second as we noted the present work does not necessarily help us learn about who does not participate in srcs rather it tells us to learn more about children and youth who do elect to participate libraries desire to broaden access to their programs and materials and to reach those who might most benefit from their services alternative approaches for learning about who does not participate in srcs should be considered in future work finally the present study did not examine whether children who enrolled in the src completed the program as intended this is a very interesting endeavor for future research as important as it is to learn about who does and does not enroll in srcs across the nations libraries it is also essential to ensure that these programs have their desired effects on children and youth to provide them access to reading materials over the summer months and ideally to enhance their reading skills and motivation to read
