 journal of education for library and information science experience in recent years in courses for the information science professions provided by the school of computer and information science at ecu has shown that if participation in forums is offered as an optional unstructured and purely social means of overcoming their isolation a few will take up the opportunity with enthusiasm more may try if prompted by the tutor but few sustained conversations and very little regular participation will result it is clear that beginning online students need a powerful incentive to overcome their reluctance and participate constructively in online forums thus a strategy has been devised whereby discussion forums are used as a vehicle for structured assessment students are provided with three problems or issues that they must first research for themselves write an initial contribution of approximately  words and post that to the forum for their group on a particular date then they are asked to participate in constructive discussions and feedback to other students asking questions endorsing opinions adding information they have found at the end of the semester students are assessed on a collation of their initial postings for each problem together with what they consider to be their two best responses to other students for each problem the comments that follow are taken from those reflections provided by a group of students undertaking one of their final units called documenting the corporate memory which covers issues in and standards for archival description and provision of public access to archival records these comments are extracted with permission from a reflection required as part of their assessment on whether the process of using forums has enhanced their learning in the unit it is interesting to note that at this stage none mentions problems with managing the technology it seems such problems have been overcome and are no longer an issue this strategy of assessment through discussion forums is used in four of seven units in the archives and records discipline area full time postgraduate students in these courses will be in their second semester when enrolled in the last unit that employs forums to facilitate online studies many students in these courses complete their studies part time and have worked online for four six or even more semesters by the time they reach their final semester they are seasoned users of discussion forums by this stage and their comments are particularly interesting for they offer insights as to whether working online becomes easier undergraduate part time students are working through the equivalent of three years full time study student endorsement for online discussion strategies there is a strong consensus that the assignment forums provide a stimulating experience and broaden students knowledge drawing on shared research and experience anna a postgraduate student put it very well the forum discussions allow me and other students to benefit from the knowledge of others through the discussions it became clear that some students have a good understanding andor a background in information technology it was useful to read their interpretations of the issue and gain a greater understanding of how pp networks
supporting first year e learners   work forums served a useful purpose they allowed students to share and further their knowledge and to see issues from new perspectives by expanding discussions into areas that the individual student may not have considered through their own study judith a seasoned undergraduate student wrote research of these topics uncovers a wealth of information about the exploration taking place in national and international archival communities the process of sharing the sources of such information leads to a greater understanding of the topics donna reflected the topics that were covered in these problems were often quite complex and it was difficult to fully grasp some of the concepts that were presented in the associated readings    however as in the past these online forum discussions have been an extremely helpful means to condense and absorb the concepts the level of analysis of the topics that is required to write an initial posting assisted in providing a fairly in depth understanding of the problems reading and discussing other points of view on the topics helped to form even stronger opinions and ideas on the issues    unfortunately the amount of time required to write responses didn allow me to participate in discussions as much as i intended to however overall i think that the process of reading other students opinions and interpretations enabled me to gain a broader understanding of the issues particularly the posts from those who were able to relate real life experiences from working in a records related field lee also an undergraduate student explored these views in more depth knowing that my peers will make constructive comments gives further impetus to producing the best work i can in the time frame available i do not feel able to give any opinion on a problem unless i have grasped the concepts in depth it is very interesting to see the breadth of sources used by other students and the differing conclusions reached the same basic information can be viewed from a number of different angles it is enlightening and thought provoking to consider others insights which may be complementary or opposing to my own whilst i find the research stimulating the challenge lies in considering other interpretations and responding constructively at times i have been impressed with the lucid grasp another seems to have of the subject with which i have struggled alternatively i may find another impressions to be so at odds with my own that i feel compelled to persuade that person to the contrary point of view based on evidence i have found    the interaction with fellow students has built camaraderie and enabled us to find support within the group over time i have warmed to the idea of the discussion group and now view it as a vital learning curve in my quest for knowledge and understanding of the subject loretta believes her participation in the forum discussions has contributed to successes in the workplace overall i firmly believe these exercises have contributed directly to my confidence in the rofessional discussion arena in the workplace for example i recently successfully negotiated the inclusion of a separate business unit records unit to come under the reporting structure of my records unit these negotiations took place with two senior executives and involved my presenting a list of pros and cons followed by
 journal of education for library and information science a credible and convincing argument where i could see was making a positive impression as i spoke i could not have achieved this a couple of years ago and attribute these skills directly to the forum postings and the course overall continuing anxiety in online students all of the above add up to a strong endorsement for requiring participation in online discussions to overcome feelings of isolation and increase student satisfaction with online studies however let us return to our concern with student anxiety although there is consensus among the students that the forum discussions have been beneficial two in a group of nineteen students all with significant experience of online study and forum discussions indicated this style of assessment is still accompanied by significant anxiety or reluctance to participate linda a part time undergraduate student reports i enjoyed reading all the other postings and i did learn more and more from the others but for my answers i felt that they were not very good at all as i struggled with the understanding and then struggled with answering other peoples comments over all i did learn more than i would have just from reading the readings i learnt from the other postings and the research they did as i found some different sites that i had not found but overall i did struggle with the whole concept of being out in front of the other students  i found that when the other students answer with so much depth it makes me feel very inadequate linda suggested progressive feedback from the tutor on postings before the assignment is complete would help to allay these fears no doubt she is right because linda work on the forums displayed a sound methodical approach to topics she knew little about at first and some reassurance may well have helped build her confidence in her postings to the second problem she worked logically through the definitions and issues and in so doing helped make the topic clearer for herself and for others in problem  her approach paid off again conveying to fellow students in straightforward terms what pp networks are and what the inherent problems might be as well as the advantages in other words she needed confidence building rather than assistance with her approach to the set problems but anderson et al note on forums set up for discussing specific problems the tutor should not intervene unless inaccurate or misleading information is posted students are encouraged to manage their own discussions to encourage each other and to maintain a professional standard intervention by the tutor runs the risk of being seen as the ight answer which might then stifle the discussion there is a real danger that intervention by the tutor will interrupt the flow of conversation more importantly it runs the risk of reducing students ownership of the conversation and their understanding that it is their responsibility to support and encourage each other by maintaining the flow and to constructively evaluate and build upon others contributions if it were done at all it would need to be private formative feedback provided
