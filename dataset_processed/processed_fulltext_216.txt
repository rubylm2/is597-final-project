organizations of employees with especial reference to library personnel orme w phelps in this discussion i arrive at the conclusion that the library profession would be benefited by the establishment of a national association of library personnel authorized and able to speak for the profession as a whole the conclusion is not revolutionary in fact it is hardly individual since it is derived from the experience of occupational groups in this country during the last one hundred and fifty years however if it thereby lacks the quality of drama it enjoys the virtue of obviousness which in the present context is the more desirable in arriving at the conclusion just stated my opening argument and certainly my most difficult one because of its intangibility is the usefulness of organizations of employees in the maintenance of the morale of the working force the pragmatic evidence of this fact lies all about us in a world which professor t v smith has described as overorganized and in which the demands of employee organizations of all types have become more insistent with each passing decade a more recent development however is the growth of a body of analytical data concerning employee attitudes and their effects upon co operation and productivity in these studies the drive for and impetus of employee organization is a constantly recurring theme when combined with the professional character of library administration these propositions produce a secondary conclusion to the effect that vigorous employee organization should be supported and encouraged by library managements out of pure self interest several intermediate steps are involved in moving from the question of staff morale to the verdict of a powerful centralized fraternity of library professionals employee organizations have advantages and disadvantages and the thesis is strengthened if these are balanced against each other before a commitment is made institutional requirements are not uniform and it may be said for some more than for others that employee organization will show a decided profit it is well also to pay more than lip service to historical tendencies and current practice within the employing unit employee association is a growth sometimes rapid more often slow and it usually builds upon earlier foundations the appropriateness of a given type of organization to the requirements of employees is a fairly complicated problem of analysis simplified only where the varying needs of the staff economic social professional etcpoint in succession to the same type of agency it is submitted in the following comments that the desirable form of organization for library employees can be laid down with considerable assurance and that its outlines should prove attractive to administrators as well as to staff our first step in that project will be to expand the meaning of the word organization  this article constitutes a chapter in the forthcoming publication personnd administration in libraries ed loweh martin chicago university of chicago press  
organizations of employees  formal and informal employee organization in this connection i think it will be useful to distinguish between two important types or species of organizazation one of these formal organization whether of employees or of management has for a long time been the subject of clinical examination and its theory and practice comprise an extensive literature its counterpart which i shall call informal organization after one of its leading theorists while hidden between the lines of many a treatise on formal organization has only recently become a subject of investigation in its own right at least with respect to its contribution to the functioning of purposive groups now however the advance of current research into the patterns of social groups and their significance for society and industry is promising to explain modes of conduct hitherto incompatible with the formal theory of management the minimum obligation of the student of administration would seem to be to incorporate these findings into his conception of organization to the extent that matters previously regarded as extraneous have been shown to affect morale and production as a matter of fact this has been done one writer who has discussed the subject in a very broad and suggestive fashion is chester i barnard in his treatise on the functions of the executive to which i shall refer again there is no necessity of reviewing here the characteristics of formal organizations but it might be helpful to summarize the features of informal organizations in the sense that the words are used in this paper the term and the description are both taken from barnard book under the heading what informal organizations are the author says it is a matter of general observation and experience that persons are frequently in contact and interact with each other when their relationships are not a part of or governed by any formal organization the magnitude of the numbers involved varies from two persons to that of a large mob or crowd the characteristic of these contacts or interactions is that they occur and continue or are repeated without any specific conscious joint purpose the contact may be accidental or incidental to organized activities or arise from some personal desire or gregarious instinct it may be friendly or hostile but whatever the origins the fact of such contacts interactions or groupings changes the experience knowledge attitudes and emotions of the individuals affected the persistence of such effects is embodied in states of mind and habits of action which indicate the capacities of memory experience and social conditioning as a result of these capacities some of the effects of contacts of persons with limited numbers of persons can spread through very large numbers in a sort of endless chain of interaction over wide territories and through long periods of time by infornal organization i mean the aggregate of the personal contacts and interactions and the associated groupings of people that i have just described though common or joint purposes are excluded by definition common or joint results of important character nevertheless come from such organization the functions of informal organizations listed by barnard are three i the facilitation of communication  the maintenance of cohesiveness in formal organizations through regulating the willingness to serve and the stability of objective authority and  the maintenance of the feeling of personal integrity of self respect of independent choice now while barnard was writing as an executive and for executives an examination of the functions ascribed to  cambridge mass harvard university press  see esp chaps ix and xv  pp i is  p i
 the library quarterly informal organizations indicates their extreme importance to personnel at all levels and no one who has read the book carefully can fail to be impressed with the breadth and inclusiveness of its generalizations a healthy informal organization is a prerequisite to good morale of executives professionals or rank andfile which brings us to the relationship between formal and informal organizations it is unnecessary for our purposes and would probably be meaningless to attempt to establish a hierarchy of importance as between formal and informal organization certainly the latter is the more pervasive large numbers of groups of varying size and at least semipurposive in character for example families many partnerships etccome into existence operate successfully for many years and pass out of the picture with little or no formal organization throughout their history a more profitable line of inquiry might be the division of procedural jurisdictions here it is observed that formality is relied on in the fields of policy authoritarian direction and appeals supervision and control and the selection of leaders on the other hand operations the carrying out of policy directions and orders is an informal matter especially at the final step of contact between employee and customer employee and materials employee and employee in the absence of the most rigorous motion study and supervision the method tempo approach attitude and personality of the operator are matters of individual choice and are conditioned by the many elements described by barnard and others it is an oversimplification but i believe a useful one to say that informal organizations get things done and it is a function of formal organization among other things to facilitate informal organization i come now to a full statement of the purpose of this discussion it is peculiarly true that formal employee organizations in general have only indirect functional relationship to the objectives of the parent association the library the firm the governmental unit or the school this has resulted in criticism and opposition which frequently has extended to controversy and conflict it is respectfully submitted that an understanding of the requirements of informal organizations and their essential importance to operating units provides a clue to the usefulness of formal organizations of employees and a basis for analyzing their appropriateness in a given situation appropriateness is a complex term in this connection involving not only the structure function and methodology of the operating unit but also the purposes attitudes ideologies and backgrounds of the employees in the light of these observations it is the purpose of this paper to examine the contribution which formal organizations of library employees might be expected to make to the needs and purposes of the unit of which they are members and to draw some conclus see burleigh gardner human relations in industry chicago richard d irwin inc  elton mayo the human problems of an industrial civilization new york macmillan co  t n whitehead leadership in a free society cambridge mass harvard university press  and f j roethlisberger and w j dickson management and the worker technical vs social organization in an industrial plant business research studies no g boston harvard graduate school of business administration  the interlocking character of the process is indicated by barnard statement formal organizations arise out of and are necessary to informal organization but when formal organizations come into operation they create and require informal organizations op cit p 
organizations of employees  sions as to the type of organization most appropriate for the purpose types of formal organiezations organizations of employees are today the rule and not the exception wherever one looks he finds a professional association a trade union a technical society a staff clinic a labor management committee an employee representation plan an office club or some other designation indicating collective action on the part of personnel variations in structure seem almost as numerous the question naturally arises does this proliferation of form reflect a basic differentiation in substance and function the matter has been argued violently by management trade unionists economists and legislators and a decision has been reached with regard to one fundamental point of divergence an employee organization initiated sponsored maintained supported or assisted in any way by management is not a bona fide employee organization for purposes of collective bargaining the conclusion is embodied in the wagner act and similar state legislation and is now supported by one of the most remarkably unbroken lines of court decisions in our judicial history the issue there decided is instructive for employee groups of less militant character the wagner act spelled the death of company unionism in private industry a term which stood for employee representation limited in scope to the employing unit and barred from co operation with outside groups if any single point has become accepted in the economics of collective bargaining it is that independent local employee organizations may perform social recreational and welfare functions but are practically without influence upon wages and conditions of work in establishing or enforcing standards of entrance into the occupation or in imposing sanctlons upon nonconformist administrations this is as true of a professional society as of a trade union with this primary difference disposed of let us examine the similarities among employee organizations there has been a tendency for likenesses to be concealed as a result of the controversial position of the labor movement especially in recent years and the special pleading for and against certain types of association upon impartial examination however we find at least three important characteristics which appear in all formal aggregations of personnel first we find an extension of the principle of industrial democracy popularized by the webbs which implies some measure of popular sovereignty on basic issues and in the selection of leaders the leaders may be nothing more than committee chairmen and the issues may be restricted to personnel matters but the employees have more voice in the matter with organization than without it second employee organization is always accompanied by the opening up of new channels of communication to management the complaint the grievance or the suggestion so often smothered or believed to be smothered in the past in its transmission through line officers is passed along a private wire so to speak by individuals who consider it a major responsibility rather than incidental to their jobs third the employees are introduced to  throughout the remainder of this paper the term employee organization will be used in the customary sense as meaning formal organization  see harry a millis and royal e montgomery organized labor the economics of labor vol iii new york mcgraw hill book co inc  p  for a discussion of the variety of titles developed in connection with industrial employee representation plans or company unionism
 the library quarterly the idea of self help through organization the results range from credit unions to beer parties and from community opera to dental clinics co operation has spread widely through economic social welfare fiscal recreational and vocational activities with an influence in the aggregate which no one can measure employee organization may originate with management or with employees or may result from an outside stimulus whatever the source its persistence and spread are indicative of a felt need which requires to be served managerial advantages and disadvantages of employee organizations like the tariff employee organization is a local issue it comes to a focus upon certain employees members of a certain employing unit in a given locality the all important factor external to the group is the reaction of management this categorical statement may be justified by the observation that without recognition employee organization cannot survive and it is management that decides whether or not to recognize and what recognition means in the past managerial response has run the gamut from initiation and sponsorship to active opposition while the personalities and immediate circumstances of each case have always been influential a fairly consistent distinction may be drawn between the attitudes of proprietors of profit seeking and not forprofit institutions the former frequently and understandably have been much more opposed to any relinquishment of authority than the latter the explanation of course is no secret to anyone even moderately familiar with business and institutional practice it lies in the exigencies of competition the constant imminence of bankruptcy and the clarity and directness of opposition of interest the managers of nonprofit institutions on the other hand are only rarely confronted with vigorous direct competition their budgets are often independent of their revenues and it is uncommon that an increase in the share going to employees means a reduction in their personal incomes this explanation is by no means exhaustive many other factors have been involved the temper and limitations of the employee organization concerned conditions of employmentparticularly the matter of uncertainty background and training of both parties ignorance and misunderstanding of purposes etc one observation may be made with assurance during the past decade there has been a remarkable increase in managerial curiosity concerning the advantages and disadvantages of organizations of employees let us see how these balance off certain spokesmen for industrial management to the contrary notwithstanding i believe that it is fairly well agreed by now that there are definite observable gains to administrators from employee organization of even the most militant type in large part these benefits are indirect but they are there and more and more administrators are realizing them in all cases they must be weighed against the disadvantages which are just as real and often much more obvious though perhaps not for  opposition of interest is not a settled issue but its scope is much too large to be debated here for the purposes of this discussion it will be sufficient to state that i agree with millis that the theory of collective bargaining implies opposition of interests which concept in the form of inequality of bargaining power is stated in the preamble to the wagner act see millis and montgomery op cit pp  
organizations of employees  that reason necessarily more important in either the short or the long run again without attempting to be exhaustive a few of the principal gains and losses will be detailed first on any list of profits from the collective action of employees would be improved morale or the strengthening of informal organization how does it come about i am not sure that anyone knows for certain but the theory has been advanced that the employee gains status from his membership and participation his increased contacts and sympathies and his at least supposed greater importance when speaking through his group than as an individual his self respect is improved his power of initiative strengthened and his capacity to co operate enlivened these qualities are intangibles of a high order however few supervisors are unaware of them or their consequences benefits closely related to the preceding have grown out of the creation of new lines of communication for the handling of grievances and in some cases employee suggestions the establishment of grievance procedure has two counts in its favor first it provides an emotional release for the employee by satisfying him that what he considers an unfairness will certainly receive a hearing accurate measurement of the amount of future trouble thus avoided is impossible however as an employee for five years of a large industrial establishment with no grievance procedure whatever my personal testimony would be that nothing is more important to good relations the second count favoring grievance procedure is the removal of the mass of complaints accusations and misunderstandings with their high emotional charge from the functional lines of communication whose principal responsibility is to get the day work done this incompatibility of temper in communications alone it seems to me is sufficient explanation of the breakdown of adjustments in large highly formalized establishments employee suggestions for the improvement of practice and method are as valuable a potential source of assistance as employee grievances are a hindrance they run to the technical side and hence seem well adapted to the standard lines of communication however the throttling or appropriation of employee suggestions has at times turned out to be a major grievance and some well run suggestion systems have produced a startling output of ideas which seemed at least indicative of previous interference here the explanation seems to lie in the proprietary attitudes of individuals toward their jobs and the improvements that they can devise for doing them many instances have been uncovered of employees refusing to make known special methods or devices which they had worked out and which enabled them to excel even though the advantage was not reflected in their pay it is notable that some of the most successful suggestion systems have appeared in the presence of formal employee organization of one form or another we shall mention two more features of employee organization in both of which the gain to management is more direct one is the assumption by the employee group of certain staff functions which would otherwise require special attention and personnel for their discharge induction training and indoctrination are commonly so assigned employee manuals and house organs have been pre suggestion systems really fall within the purview of incentive compensation
 the library quarterly pared in this manner welfare activities with recreational financial and educational objectives are commonly recognized as obligations of the union the committee or the council since some or all of the foregoing are accepted as responsibilities by some or all managements their transfer to employee groups is a direct saving of time and effort finally but by no means least in importance there are examples of organized employee assistance in external affairs notably in the lobbyist activities of aggregations of public employees and the support given to institutional administration by professional societies such as the american association of university professors recognizing that a stronger and more comprehensive case can be made for the credit side by a true believer let us turn to some of the more obvious disadvantages which accompany formal organizations of employees they exist and they deserve equal attention with the advantages high on the list with administrative officers and not to be passed over too lightly by the observer without responsibility is the placing of limitations upon or the loss of sovereignty which to the manager means the right to make rapid unchallenged arbitrary decisions this can mean a serious loss of short run efficiency and perhaps of long run effectiveness it is altogether too true of many activities that the institution is only the lengthened shadow of a man in competitive situations the reduction in flexibility may easily be fatal it is worth noting that those organizations with the simplest objectives for which efficiency is the highest goal i refer to the armed services have never permitted the slightest modification of authority in dealing with subordinates and no one expects them to some employee organizations today present the paradox of the most authoritarian and arbitrary dictation upon the part of their leaders while at the same time demanding industrial democracy from their employers leadership is the subject of an extensive literature none of it too explicit whatever its components may be it is an intangible of equal potency to employee morale and perhaps tampered with at equally as great a cost following close upon the heels of limitation of managerial authority another drawback of employee organization is the almost unavoidable blurring of lines of authority which accompanies the multiplication of channels of communication you will recall that barnard considers formal channels of communication and lines of authority as practically synonymous and executives as primarily centers of communication the current controversy over the unionization of foremen and the many discussions of the troubles of middle management are directly related to this redistribution of managerial prerogatives for that is what it amounts to in this respect also equity is probably paid for at the expense of efficiency though it is possible to  the extent to which this has occurred among industrial managements during the past few years of rapid unionization is illustrated by neil chamberlain article the organized business in america journal of political economy lii june i  iii  particularly in the industrial sector american institutions have been undergoing a rapid rearrangement and redistribution of power for more than a decade those who are interested in a careful and competent account of analogous russian industrial experience during the trial and error period from  to  should read g bienstock solomon n schwarz and aaron yugow management in russian in dustry and a griculture london oxford university press i although magnified many times or perhaps because of that the analogy to american experience is instructive
organizations of employees  argue in the reverse from premises stated earlier another weakness arises from the institution of grievance procedure through special agencies a forum is automatically supplied for the agitator the troublemaker and the perpetually dissatisfied the comfortable assumption that every staff is composed solely of well balanced normal individuals who need only an opportunity for self expression and an equal chance to bring out their essentially co operative tendencies needs only to be stated to be rejected the formal employee organization no matter how paternalistic is a political unit and the rhetoric of politics is the traditional language of collective bargaining the cooperative and level headed employee is not always the articulate one one extremist on a committee has been known to disrupt the whole process of joint action what is more the delicacy of the situation often makes suppression of even the most excessive claims inadvisable in this respect it is possible for the public relations function of the employee organization to become distorted until it is a serious liability as the last on our brief list of disadvantages there is the loss in time and energy from conferring dealing bargaining and discussing with employee groups in their various capacities firsthand investigation of personnel matters makes it hard to avoid the conclusion that simple pressure for time has forced official after official to put off staff conferences cancel committee meetings delegate representative functions to subordinates and generally neglect contacts whose importance they would not deny solely because of their time consuming nature undoubtedly the wartime emergency has aggravated the detriments arising from this source but they were felt before and will remain after it unfortunately the staff or committee meeting is rarely dramatic it often resembles a discussion group and seldom radiates the impression of getting somewhere to busy executives who have more demands on their time than they can possibly meet it frequently cannot help seeming a waste and goes far down on the list of priorities the recognition of employee organizations implies dealing with them and dealing takes time it is one of the costs of a step whose advantages may not seem either immediate or certain employee organizations in libraries our next step is to relate the gains and losses just enumerated to a specific class of institutional managers librarians while the generalizations which follow will probably not fit all cases i believe they can be defended as typical the library director operates a nonprofit institution frequently under governmental auspices which offers a professional service under noncompetitive conditions his staff contains a high percentage of professional people who are subject to the usual neuroses of that class hence staff morale is a major concern his budget is customarily set for him and his own rate of pay is fixed in the same manner as that of his subordinates economic conflict of interest is therefore at a minimum his organization deals almost solely in ideas which means that the intangible factors in personal service are of major importance a professional organization contains more than the usual proportion of staff personnel and staff functions em staff is here used in its customary sense as differentiated from line authority in the chain of command
 the llbrary quarterly ployee organizations have been shown to be well adapted to such responsibilities public relations are highly important to libraries the usefulness of employee groups in insuring public support has been proved in closely related fields for example education under customary budgetary procedure and in the absence of vigorous direct competition the short run demands of library management appear to require less of rapid flexible arbitrary decision and lend themselves more to persuasion and co operation on balance it seems to this observer that the advantages of employee organization considerably outweigh the disadvantages to library officials from the standpoint of the employees the benefits are even more obvious it is not surprising to discover a growth of formal employee organizations among library employees and an interest upon the part of library managements in the subject let us then proceed to a consideration of the appropriate type of formal organization for library personnel we shall operate on the assumption that the forms of organization which have developed in the past have borne some reasonable relation to the purposes and needs of employees served by them and that the many differentiations of structure and function were an outgrowth of a process of natural selection and survival of the fittest we shall also assume that it is possible to survey a particular type of employee and his surroundings in relation to the various forms of employee organization which have already appeared in that environment or which might reasonably be expected to develop and to say with some confidence that a particular kind of organization is better adapted to his requirements than another however persuasive the statement proves to be it may or may not affect his choice that is a different matter but in the case of library personnel i believe that we can be rather specific with a good deal of confidence the practical choice in the past and currently for library employees seems to lie between a trade union and a local staff association or whatever it may be called with the latter far more widely adopted thus far library unionism has been a negligible portion of the submerged tenth of the american tradeunion movement with about a dozen locals scattered from butte montana to washington dc the monthly labor review for june i reported the unionization of clerical and professional workers as totaling i ooo about one tenth of all union membership and one eighth of the employees in those classifications however a majority of the iooooo were government employees and the great majority of them were in the postal service outside the postal service and the government only a little over  per cent of the clerical and professional workers were unionized the future of white collar unionism was just as bleak according to one experienced observer and confirmed trade unionist staff associations on the other hand have had a steady growth since their origin in ii and have increased rapidly since their  this statement will be recognized as a modification of the one best way assumption of the early scientific management theorists is merlyn s pitzele the outlook for whitecollar unionism management reviewv xxxiii june z i  see also bernard berelson library unionization library quarterly ix i  io for an exhaustive report on library unions here and abroad

 the library quarterly fall and the remuneration of the catalogers will rise likewise a glut of librarians or and this is important of persons deemed competent to do library work relative to other occupational groups means that librarians will suffer in salary and perquisites no short run program of amelioration will be very effective so long as the boundaries of the profession are poorly defined standards are low and the general public remains uneducated to the need for trained and competent personnel in the acquisition housing management and distribution of the accumulated knowledge of the race what is equally important no long run program of amelioration is likely to progress far unless sponsored and led by a tightly integrated nation wide organization capable of speaking authoritatively for the profession as a whole the economic function of an employee organization cannot be discharged effectively by independent groups even when they are working for the same end the conclusion is just as appropriate to grievance adjustment as when applied to more basic issues of terms and conditions of employment witness the experience of the aaup the medical and bar associations and the railroad unions another important gain is achieved through co ordinated rather than independent action it is probable that managerial dictation is less arbitrary in library affairs than in some other forms of institutional activity and much less than in private enterprise for reasons which should be fairly evident by now and which i shall underline explicitly i should expect library managements to inaugurate and nourish formal organizations of their employees on grounds of prime self interest nonetheless the experience of trade unionism and the lesson of the wagner act should not be forgotten organizations of employees whether professional clerical trade or labor should not be dominated by managerial representatives the more successful employee representation plans in private industry flourished in an atmosphere of employer co operation but outright managerial domination and direction were conspicuously absent a large number of such groups have been certified as bona fide independent unions by the national labor relations board and no one to my knowledge has accused the board of trying to legalize employerdominated bodies a national organization of library employees even though it included administrative officials as qualified members would be far less likely to reflect exclusively the administrative point of view and would have a much freer hand in the investigation of grievances or other alleged departures from approved managerial practice librarians are not numerous in total numbers they are a negligible proportion of even the professional population which at last report was about  per cent of the civilian labor force their economic weight is small enough at best if economic problems have an important place in the concerns of library personnel the conclusion seems inescapable that they have not as yet evolved the type of formal organization best suited to their needs an amalgamation or extension of the staff association to a professional society on a national scale would be a long step in that direction none of the other activities social representative or professional would be weakened by the move and many of them would be strengthened thereby in view of the limited numbers of library personnel in the aggregate i should also respectfully suggest the con
organizations of employees  sideration of alliance with other groups of similar backgrounds and aims this affinity could be anything from casual and informal contact to formal federation it would be in the best tradition of co operation between like minded trade and professional groups and in the past such compacts have yielded important strategic gains perhaps a word of apology and one of warning are called for at this point the apology consists of a brief justification of employee organization which has thus far been presented mostly in its negative aspects of protection ethically the defense of an occupation is justified in the same manner as the defense of anything else namely in terms of its usefulness to society if the members of the library profession feel that they are performing a socially valuable service it is my conviction that they are justified in using all legitimate methods to bring that fact to the attention of either the general public or specially interested parties it has certainly been demonstrated again and again that no one else will take the trouble if the result is an improvement of the position of the profession so that it can render a better service the gain is social it is freely granted that advancement of the group can be pushed too far and may rest on too limited a basis that is for the group and society to decide in the case of librarians i doubt that they have yet overreached themselves in the matters of power and position the warning is more serious nothing could be further from my intention than to imply that a national professional association of librarians or a national association of library employees would automatically solve the personnel problems of library employees or administrators i am convinced that it would be a step in the right direction or to put it another way that steps in that direction would be beneficial and help in solving many problems at the same time they would raise problems of their own the associational advancement of personnel of any type is a job of considerable delicacy and poses many difficulties for its initiators and supporters agreement upon objectives is often easier than agreement upon methods of reaching them the organization of library employees is a problem to be worked out through time by library personnel and administrators within the existing institutional framework and with due regard to the peculiarities of the profession in many ways the situation is one of unusual complexity involving as it does degrees of professional competence the individualities of governmental procedure and civil service requirements as well as the exigencies of the general labor market it would be impertinent for an outsider to do any more than generalize from the experience of other employee organizations which have met in their various ways the same types of problems which library personnel face and to attempt to indicate the factors which have spelled out success or failure the relevance of these remarks to library administrators is twofold in the first place library officials are professional people and the welfare of the profession is their welfare if the profession gains in esteem and vitality they rise with it if the opposite occurs theirs is the greatest loss a vigorous formal organization representative of the profession could hardly fail to improve its position with the public and with particular elements of the public whose decisions are crucial to the success of its work in the second place whether they
 the library quarterly admit it or not library administrators are concerned with the informal organization of their staffs one of the functions of formal organization is to assist and facilitate a healthy informal organization formal organizations of employees could hardly be as prevalent as they are today if they were not catering to a definite need on the part of their members if this conclusion seems reasonable and it is supported by a considerable body of analytical evidenceit is submitted that managements are serving themselves as well as their subordinates if they help them to realize their ends summary to summarize briefly this analysis rests upon the belief that formal organization contributes to the success of informal organization and that the latter is a principal ingredient of morale the many varieties of formal organization among employees have several basic features in common the extension of the principle of popular sovereignty within functional groups the opening of new channels of communication and the principle of employee self help through organization their differences represent adjustments to the individualities of background purpose and method of occupational groups their advantages appear to outweigh their disadvantages for librarians the current practical choice of library personnel is between a trade union on the one hand and a local staff association on the other for reasons outlined in some detail it is doubted that trade unionism is the appropriate form of organization for library personnel or that it will develop much more attraction for them in the future than it has in the past the staff association as now constituted has the fatal weakness of independence if it is to play a significant part in the development of the profession the chief recommendation contained herein is for amalgamation or extension of local staff groups into a national organization qualified and able to speak for librarians on matters of special interest to them in addition it is suggested that librarians consider the possibility of alliance with other groups to overcome the numerical weakness of their profession finally it is submitted that it is to the interests of library administrators to assist their employees in the development of formal organizations suitable to their needs
