the relationship between the library and collegiate objectives r b arragon aquarter century of membership in a college library committee has given me as a layman coming before a conference of professionals some assurance and much caution i have been close to problems of book budget and departmental allocation of reserve books documents shelving staffing and of the blueprint for a library wing at least close enough to recognize their complexity and to respect the difficulties of those who have to deal with them day after day year in and year out i am hesitant therefore about putting my topic in the form of hat are we college professors now asking of the college library suspecting that perhaps it had better be nvhat opportunities do the curriculum and the extra curricular interests of students now offer to libraries may we on either side of the professional line try to answer both questions at once changing collegiate objectives or at least changing methods of achieving these have given or offered the library an increasingly strategic place in the education of the undergraduate this has not been primarily because of the development of programs in general education with their aim to provide a broad and common intellectual experience at the college level or earlier but rather because of the efforts to engage students actively in learning for themselves lectures textbooks and examinations have been supplemented and though seldom entirely replaced have been in many curriculums overshadowed by methods of challenging students to take a large share in their education if in the natural sciences this has long been sought in the laboratories when not reduced to routine in the humanities and social sciences it has more recently been encouraged by transforming recitation or quiz section into group discussion discussion requires something to be discussed something which students can try to understand for themselves raise questions and hazard answers about and point to as evidence for or against these answers what serves on the group conference table as an object of discussion can often be equally the object of individual interpretation in essays or reports usually this object is a book or part of a book other ossibilities will be referred to later not one that needs only be memorized like many textbooks but one that calls for imagination and inquiry a poem drama or novel a history an essay in criticism or in philosophy a treatise in one of the social sciences when the purpose is the cultivation of sensitivity and reflection of analysis and judgment rather than the inculcation of information and ready made conclusions the teacher and student can indeed must cut through the devices that protect them from thought and emotion and have recourse to books that encourage them to think and to feel for themselves they go to the sources primary and secondary where they may encounter originality in ideas and in expression the return to the sources is par
the library and collegiate objectives  ticularly noticeable in the humanities for original written works are among their characteristic objects of study generalizations as formulas for the understanding of life or of art are not their aim or at least their primary aim nor is it the classification and summary of writers and writings these staples of textbooks when useful are so as helps for approaching the works not as substitutes for them introductory and other essays by sensitive and critical scholars essays which are themselves objects worthy of humanistic study will contribute more than will outlines and commonplaces the aim of the humanities is the engagement of the feeling and thought of the student in the written or other word before him it is upon this that his appreciation and understanding are focused and through this that they are developed the humanistic emphasis upon reading and interpretation applies not only to works of poetic and prose fiction and of literary criticism but to histories and to all written evidences both iterary and documentary of particular events persons and situations in the past it applies to the works of a philosopher to the exposition of a theory in the natural sciences and to an essay or systematic treatise in the social sciences all these may be studied for themselves as humanistic events that is as particular expressions of men thought emphasis upon the use of books other than textbooks is not confined however to the humanities philosophy and the social sciences as fields that aim at generalization and systembuilding can challenge their students to imaginative and critical inquiry by confronting them with examples of such inquiry here as in the humanities it is by analysis and interpretation of particular creations of human thought that the student in group discussion and in writing essays and reports under guidance educates himself no longer dependent upon a handy manual which with some lecture notes will assure passing examinations and getting a grade in a course the student must have access to a wide variety of printed materials the number and range of these may be illustrated in an extreme but not untypical form from the humanities course at reed college the poetic works used in this two year program include epics as diverse as the odyssey lucretius on the nature of things the song of roland and the divine comedy a romance of chretien de troyes some of the canterbury tales and lyrics ranging from the seventeenth century to the twentieth dramatic poetry from the greeks to goethe has an important part the novel is introduced or anticipated with don quixote and is a major concern from stendhal to kafka philosophy especially as political social and ethical theory has representatives from plato to dewey specifically christian writing is drawn from the new testament augustine thomas aquinas luther pascal and others the works of herodotus and thucydides are matched by those of modern historians these which offer the background of institutional history for the major phases of western society are varied special volumes and chapters wherever possible those of thoughtful specialists are preferred to chronological surveys the range is not so wide in most programs in the humanities and the social sciences but the practice is often similar and is becoming increasingly so especially in the introductory and general courses the resulting problem for the student of getting hold of so many and diverse works is serious he can scarcely
 the library quarterly be expected to buy all or a large proportion of them a common solution is to find or to put the materials into a volume or two anthologies published for the general reader as well as for the student are likely to contain whole works and in consequence to be limited to special kinds or periods of literature discursive subject matter such as political theory and art criticism can rarely be represented in anthologies with complete treatises but long and continuous sections from a few authors may serve well the inclusion of selections from many works necessarily cuts down the excerpts from each work to the point where they are likely to illustrate what the editor wanted them to say rather than how the author developed his thought continuity is better than spotty coverage a full chapter than paragraphs from several chapters a sequence of chapters than isolated ones much depends of course on the nature of the work poetry is difficult to cut even in the case of epics though there may be sections that have enough structural distinctness to be usable alone with the aid of lectures or introductions suggesting their place in the whole the divine comedy is at least a debatable example lyric poetry and drama are denatured by cutting novels sometimes may be reduced without too much loss witness putnam editing of the portable cervantes but not to the extent required for anthologies short stories would be better for this purpose histories lose much if read in short sections unless we want only speeches from thucydides or tales from herodotus for modem historians the alternative of selecting short historical articles from journals or of commissioning special essays for a collaborative volume has not yet proved a definite success at least in our experience documents charters laws letters etc can be anthologized though cutting is a delicate matter it may as with other kinds of materials doctor the evidence a similar distortion may result from an introduction to the excerpts chosen from any author more frequent and therefore more serious is the hindrance to the student reading of the passages for himself that may result from telling him in advance what he is to find he often needs some background but how definitely directive should it be recent collections of documents have been organized so that the materials could be used to throw light on particular historical and theoretical problems and even to answer specific questions posed by the editors such organization provides a unifying frame of reference that sharpens and narrows the students interpretation of diverse selections like laboratory experiments and mathematical problems it trains in certain skills of analysis and has its place along with other methods of handling original materials but it may especially outtside the purely documentary field so limit self directed and openminded exploration as to do more harm than good indication of relevant points of view or of alternative and controversial meanings may on occasion encourage a student to vary or to enlarge his own perspective when we want to do more than to train specific skills the indication of a documentary problem like the introduction to selections from literary historical or philosophical works should be suggestive rather than prescriptive opening up rather than foreclosing the issues anthologies at their best usable for specific purposes do not solve the general problem even if a course staff can make its own collection and what staff can be satisfied with that of some other
the library and collegiate objectives  college and has a wide margin of tolerance as to length of fragments an anthology cannot be inclusive enough works that are to be read in full will bulk too large and others will be too few for an extensive course or too scantily represented attractive translations will be protected by copyright moreover even one own anthology constrains the flexibility of the program inhibiting the innovative enthusiasm of a teacher or a staff for fresh and more fruitful materials anthologies of various sorts may be used to supplement one another and to supplement the use of separate volumes containing one or a few closely related complete works upon which as far as possible reliance should be placed these are to my mind the best solution one that has become more practical with the multiplication of series several of them inexpensive of literary historical and philosophical classics and of contemporary writings in the same and related fields they are a boon to the teacher and the student and to the college library for the library has been and is likely to continue to be primarily responsible for providing the duplicates necessary in courses that do not rely on textbooks and anthologies and seek to take the student to original works in as close to the original form as possible the duplicate reserve collection is older than programs m general education even older than the attention begun about thirty five years ago to great books any required or attractive course that strayed occasionally beyond a textbook or two in its assignments needed a reserve but the popularity of the use of primary materials combined with the movement for general education has forced the extension of the number of these collections and their expansion in size and scope i wonder however whether even now they are adequate to the needs actual and potential in so far as they are not so the reasons are obvious the difficulties are probably at bottom largely financial one to four or five is certainly not high for the ratio of copies to students even when many members of the class buy a considerable proportion of the works assigned the ratio might advantageously be made better than that for a book that alone comprises the reading for a single week to spend any part of limited book budgets on duplicate copies when it might go toward increasing the new resources of the library seems well nigh criminal to librarians and professors alike and i share this feeling special funds are preferable either granted from tuition receipts or what comes to the same an over all book fee charged to each student perhaps as part of a broader incidental fee covering laboratory materials as well rental with private purchase as an alternative for the student will also cover costs in several years but seems of doubtful practicability except for a few volumes to be read steadily over a number of weeks or months and to be kept on the assignment lists until paid for a collection does not have to be bought all at once but it should never be considered as completed funds must be available for continued experimentation with new books to fill gaps to replace unsuccessful readings to put in better translations better editions and more up to date secondary works and in general to effect changes in the pattern and emphasis of the course the available reading must not be frozen if the course and its staff are to stay alive book purchase as i need not tell you is only the beginning of the problems the cost of cataloging and of removal may be kept down by accessioning only

the library and collegiate objectives  there are many technical factors involved in the problems of open stacks and open reserves that will occur to librarians more readily than to a laymanbudgets staff organization pattern of library space both for shelves and for reading size of student body and of collections reshelving by staff rather than by students and the like reserves may be open and not the stacks or vice versa a reserve reading room may have open shelves with a checkup on students leaving it as a practical compromise between freedom and security though this goes against the grain of my educational principles special departmental rooms may be made available to the undergraduate majors or by special permission to undergraduates engaged in a reading or research project small colleges have to my mind a distinct advantage in the practicability of making their collections open to all students the effectiveness of free use of the stacks and of the reserves can be heightened by tables and cubicles to facilitate browsing and study reference advice can suggest where and how to find books on one subject and what books and articles may possibly be helpful but not usually i should think exactly what to read special guidance is obviously needed in the location of materials in public documents careful introduction of entering students is particularly important introduction to the layout of the stacks and of the reserves as well as to the card catalog circulation practices and reference shelves these services are in line with the general educational policy of encouraging students from the beginning to know and to use good books in spite of the difficulties and costs the reason for having a college library is the furtherance of student self education and the college should recognize the relevant services as a necessary charge upon it for making possible the kind of education that it believes in and promises to offer undergraduates are no longer simply pupils and the possibilities for intellectual initiative which indeed should begin before college should not be postponed to the graduate school or even to the senior year before examining further the nature of the collection on the open shelves and the purchase policy that determines it we should have in view another aspect of the contemporary trend in college programs beyond general education and the more specialized seminar like advanced courses lies undergraduate research perhaps the most recent evidence of this concern is in the establishment of undergraduate grants in the behavioral sciences through the social science research council for the summer after the junior year independent or individual reading done under supervision through private conferences and written reports might be added as a fourth category but the relationship of this practice to the service of the library is not different from that of the upper class course unless it is so focused on a particular problem that it becomes in effect a project in research research by the undergraduate whether done for a serious paper in an advanced course for a special project or reading course for honors work or a bachelor thesis required of all graduates is intended to further some of the same ends as class discussion based on challenging reading materials in a more specialized and individual way it should encourage critically responsible inquiry and the capacity through analysis to formulate and to support conclusions it must necessarily relate to a particular topic usually in a special departmental field and connected with a major program but this
 the library quarterly does not make it unsuitable for liberal education unless it is done as a technical exercise that does not stretch the mind and give it the sense of discovery inquiry directed at a particular problem may be more liberalizing than an unimaginative though broader course undergraduate research however reinforces the demands made by the seminar type of advanced course in major fields upon the specialized resources of the college library the standard works good recent monographs novel and fruitful interpretations and scholarly editions of basic texts make essential contributions to many a class and provide the necessary background also for the pursuit of a problem in research a few specialized journals should be on hand for occasional articles and more important for book reviews and bibliographical surveys the student should become at least familiar with what these are and how they can serve both in exploratory reading in a field and in specific inquiry thus far i can probably go without much question in spite of the cost of a purchase policy that would insure even a modest approach to such an ideal we may grant that we ought to try to achieve this even when we fear that we cannot adequately do so i have however mentioned only secondary sources and basic original texts literary philosophical historical and other classics occasional supplement to the library collection of these works may be made when necessary for a particular project such as a senior thesis by interlibrary loan or by special purchase but what of primary materials other than the texts of classics do we need and can we afford in the library of a small college documents statistical data letters old newspapers and other sources that challenge the inquirer in a way that the comparison of secondary authorities however useful this may be cannot do students of literature philosophy historiography and social theory may at the undergraduate level find good annotated texts sufficient for their projects but inquiry into institutional history economic behavior political and sociological problems and biography and related fields will be deficient in its value even as a trial run without opportunity to interpret at least a sample of firsthand data such an opportunity cannot be offered in every part of every field but perhaps the need can be met by the gradual purchase of some key materials in special areas history sources for example might be collected for one or two english centuries for a period in american diplomatic or constitutional history for local or regional history care on the part of faculty and of library staff in planning and in watching for opportune purchase of sets will make small funds accomplish much over a number of years in carrying out a modest program for the social sciences united states documents are a mine and fortunate is the library that is a selective depository even though this good fortune brings its problems carefully planned selection continuous checking of what is received against what is published listing and filing search in aid of a student or of a faculty supervisor of a student project and so on i need not demonstrate that these tasks require at least one full time well trained and experienced librarian as a member of a division of history and social science i can assure you that in the service given to undergraduate research he is worth the cost microfilms and microcards will increasingly add to available research materials though they too require special techniques equtipment and space for handling
the library and collegiate objectives  books in foreign languages outside of the language departments offer a controversial issue for small undergraduate libraries one that is probably more and more decided in the negative the choice is in effect between a good work in english and a good perhaps a better one in french or german less usually in italian spanish or russian the original may sometime be translated but when will this be and may the work not in some cases be vital now few students and they may be becoming rarer can and fewer still will read it some may note it on the shelf and wish that they could read it i continue to think that the library and the faculty should do something for the few if only as a protest against our national monolinguality but i suspect that we can do little more than set an occasional example of a principle only university libraries can make a rule of maintaining fully satisfactory collections of significant secondary works to say nothing of source materials in modern european languages at least outside their literatures in the maintenance of a good collection faculty members are likely to have themselves as well as the students in mind as for instance in the purchase of books in foreign languages if they are not also afflicted by inability to read them self interest is a danger when it is narrowed to a specialty but if the faculty know and like worth while books and have broad interests they may be ordering to help both themselves and the students to keep abreast of what is being done in the variety of fields that they may touch in departmental and interdepartmental courses in a small college the steady and wide use of imaginative and thought provoking books as instruments of education should we hope direct the interest of undergraduates beyond the completion of the assignment if curricular and library services encourage firsthand acquaintance with creative and scholarly works through group discussion and individual inquiry and through open shelves and convenient arrangements for reading in and out of the library we should anticipate if we are doing these things well not only an increase in ability to read perceptively imaginatively and discriminatingly but also curiosity enjoyment and excitement in reading and in having books to read concrete evidence of habits of reading and of book purchase derived from such instruction rather than simply from textbooks and anthologies of fragmentary source materials and from lectures and examinations are hard for me to come by i can make only a suggestion or two a college bookstore may be a barometer of the amount and character of student purchase thus at reed a student body of  of which about  are freshmen bought this spring  portable cervantes when this was put on the reading list for the course in freshman humanities the student purchase was in the face of the library purchase of fifty copies but was apparently as much because of as in spite of the duplicate reserve upper classmen and freshmen decided that they wanted their own copies of an attractive book it could not indeed as i have already said have been put on the required list for so general and inclusive a course without library provision from many years experience we have concluded that library service does not dissuade students from building up their own libraries the reverse is the case in courses in which the student is not required to buy books the sale of literary philosophical and historical classics is large and steady it is highest for fresh
 the library quarterly men and seniors the score of the latter who buy more books than does any other class and that of juniors too is enhanced by standard scholarly works and up to date monographs this happy situation would not be possible without the enterprise of the manager of the bookstore but his enterprise is in the way he takes advantage of the emphasis of the curriculum and collaborates in purchasing for the library as well as for the store how much students borrow from the library for other than course reading i do not know the  volumes taken by  students each year in the regular four week circulation exclusive of the natural science libraries is probably in considerable part connected with courses and research projects though a wide variety of books from the general collection is reserved from time to time for the use of advanced courses there are signs however that in spite of the pressure of assigned reading students are attracted by the open shelves to look for other books to become familiar with the resources of the library in various fields and to charge out some of the books they find do curricular and extra curricular reading habits continue after college a study made by the reed librarian nearly a quarter of a century ago when present methods were in use at the college though not perhaps so intensively as now suggests a favorable response i wish that i had a more recent one for the college and had been able to search for comparable studies made for other institutions fifty per cent of the graduates responded to the questionnaire not quite equally divided between men and women with an average including some nonreaders of over ten hours per week of book reading for both professional and personal interests others can perhaps supply more convincing figures the test would of course not be just how many and what books college graduates read but how they read these books and newspapers and periodicals as well without our forgetting the results that ought to appear in how they think and feel and on what they base their interests and attitudes my discussion of the library provision of books for curricular purposes has alluded to policies and facilities for their use in particular in regard to access to and circulation of reserves and books in the main collection i have assumed general or special reading rooms ample for the daytime pressure and the possibility of relief by a oneor two hour checkout for use outside the library before the time for overnight withdrawal i have emphasized open shelves and suggested the pros and cons of self help research also needs to be thought of in terms of convenience key sources for an individual project have to be kept together for several weeks or months and related materials as well as dictionaries encyclopedias and other reference tools should be easily accessible desks in the stacks and rooms set aside for research such as a senior thesis room are normal answers though sometimes forgotten in the planning of small libraries devices for encouragement of extracurricular reading also have been common browsing rooms with shelves of standard and recent literature or loungelike comfort in a wing of a regular reading room and strategically placed shelves for new accessions or for a rental collection of contemporary fiction drama poetry and essays are examples that come readily to mind conveniently placed shelves or stands for current journals or i nell unger reading interests and habits of reed college alumni reed college bidletin vol x no  january 
the library and collegiate objectives  attractive and accessible periodical rooms may also further casual reading and the pursuit of special interests other methods as well are being tried on the initiative of librarians to lure undergraduates away from course assignments but not from books a diversion to be applauded if it is effective in moderation whether it has been too successful or not successful enough and by what measure we should judge i cannot say what more encouragement than facilities for getting books into the hands of students can libraries and librarians offer can they do anything on their own initiative to assist or to stimulate the faculty to make the library the center of study and of educational resources at least in the humanities and social sciences i am not in a position to resolve the problem presented in the natural sciences by the power of laboratories to draw books away from the central library into special libraries librarians surely can collaborate with teachers in improving the book collections they can make suggestions of purchases that will give better balance between areas in a field or will further departmental long range plans for source materials or standard sets they can call attention to new editions and translations and to new journals to encourage the making of plans and to take some initiative in carrying them out may often be a delicate matter it may take even greater tact to try to move a faculty and curriculum toward more reliance on the library and less on textbooks the college librarian has more immediate acquaintance with the students use of the collections than have most of the faculty members but of greater importance for his influence is the rapport that he has established through his work with the faculty library committee and with individual teachers he is clearly in a stronger position if he is a member of the faculty and of faculty committees as seems desirable and stronger still if he does some teaching in any case with readiness to take advantage of local curricular studies and revisions which have become numerous librarians may be able to bore from within i have been speaking of books the staple of libraries more than books may however be expected of libraries now that programs in the history and interpretative analysis of art and music have become common attention is given to provision for the firsthand acquaintance of students with works of the visual arts and of music libraries and art and music departments are natural alternatives and perhaps rivals for this responsibility firsthand acquaintance may be considered euphemistic in two senses many students bring to the study of aesthetic objects little if any direct experience with the materials and tools of artistic creation but this problem is scarcely one for the libraries closer to their concern is the normal need of substitutes for the originals either as visual objects or as performances modern technology has provided increasingly effective means of reproduction convenient for demonstration in lectures and for study by student groups and by individuals after steel engravings came photographs and slides in black and white and after these have come color prints and color slides the last step is not recognized by all art historians as an advance but in spite of the vagaries of color reproductions it seems to me that they awaken in the student at least an awareness that the qualities of painting are not limited to linear design and the plasticity of light and shadow in music there is not the same degree of doubt that phonograph records are an improvement over
 the library quarterly the rolls for player pianos and that recording has improved whether or not everyone is agreed that long playing records are more convenient for detailed analysis in class than the  we shall evidently soon have to rely entirely on them with the important exception that tape recording is developing as a competitor for certain teaching purposes teachers and librarians are not likely to overlook the place that recording has already taken also for presenting drama and poetry collections of reproductions are not in themselves enough records need machines for playing them and scores and reference books for consultation the presence of scores suggests the usefulness of a piano for some students histories of art critical studies and other works of reference are normally the accompaniments of a collection of photographs and prints in the visual arts and i can imagine the value of a small projector and screen for more than lecture purposes these facilities obviously call for special music and art rooms the problem of where these rooms should be located and under whose control arises from the several ends that they may have to serve in a small college students concentrating in the fine arts or in music will be constant users of the reproductions and of the reproducing machines as will also the faculty of these departments this active concern will attract the collections and equipment and at least some of the books to the departmental building or rooms students in nonspecialist courses in the liberal arts or general education program including humanities courses will be best served by central location and broad handling of the resources in art and music equally important are the interests of those who wish to study and to enjoy paintings and music out of course to serve them may seem at times to conflict with the convenience of both general and special courses and to warrant college supervision through the library these various services should be viewed as supplementary rather than competitive and the same view applies to the alternatves of departmental and library provision and management attribution of responsibility to one or the other or to both would depend on the capacities and attitudes of the respective staffs the available room space and the chances for increasing it the convenience of location for the college as a whole and the traditional strength and degree of success of the existing arrangement the college is fortunate that has a library building of the size and plan that enable it to provide music and art rooms the latter are i suppose more frequently housed there than are the former for acoustical if not for other reasons but it would seem wise in any case for the library to have some responsibility and supervision over what have become common resources for college education for circulation of art and music materials among students for private appreciation and study the library appears to have definite advantage it is better equipped than the average small department for charging out color prints records and scores framed color prints loaned by the term have proved popular at some institutions a small rental charge has enabled us at reed to purchase and to frame a growing collection the long playing record offers a similar opportunity perhaps on a subscription basis for revolving short loans when as with prints regular funds cannot be spared for additions and replacement
the library and collegiate objectives  the library is to be viewed as a storehouse of men work of the past and the present or rather of the various records of that work this includes creation in stone and in steel in pigment and in clay in tone and in rhythm as well as in words in the books with which this paper has been largely concerned to help to make all these available is the challenge to the college library offered by the broadening scope of college programs and at the same time by the endeavor to focus the attention of the student upon the original sources artistic scholarly and documentary from these it is hoped the student may draw not simply some knowledge of human experience but practice in those sensitive imaginative and rational skills through which he may inquire into and interpret what men have said and done and what they continue to say and do
