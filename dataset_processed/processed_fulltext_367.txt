printing in nineteenth century belize roderick cave after an initial period in which the printing needs of the british settlements in central america were met from jamaica printing was introduced into belize in  the settlement first press was unusual in being bought with public funds and controlled by the magistrates subsequent printing developments in belize were closer to the norm for british colonies in the west indies with government contractual printing and newspaper publishing forming the mainstay of most printers businesses in the nineteenth century printing for two other former british areas the bay islands and the mosquito coast is also discussed the article is based on a variety of sources principally the belize archives and the sets of belize papers preserved in the british library handlists of belize printers and of belizean newspapers published in the nineteenth century are included as appendices although the spread of printing in the british settlements of north america has been thoroughly chronicled as to a lesser extent has that in the sugar islands of the west indies the origins and early development of printing in the english speaking areas of central america have remained shrouded in obscurity of these areas the only one remaining in the commonwealth is belize officially called british honduras until  still a british colony belize is a subtropical country bounded on the north by mexico on the west and south by guatemala and on the east by the caribbean sea dotted with many islets and cays about twice the size of jamaica its small but rapidly growing population  at the  census is composed of many different racial and cultural groups in the early nineteenth century these were mayan indians caribs european settlers and their negro slaves plus a free creole element the troubled state of the central american republics and from the late s the caste wars of yucatan led to a considerable influx of  thanks are due to mrs narda dobson the staff of the national library service belize and particularly miss a gibson and miss t fairweather ms irene moran bancroft library f e leese rhodes house library d h simpson royal commonwealth society and clinton black jamaica archives without their help this paper would have been much more tentative in nature library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved 
printing in belize  spanish speaking peoples particularly in the northern part of the country after  there was also some immigration from the defeated confederate states  pp   though there were considerable settlements of baymen the british logwood and mahogany woodcutters and their negro slaves by the end of the seventeenth century the constitutional position of the british on the spanish main was by no means clear indeed the problems of sovereignty over british honduras which was described in a parliamentary act of  as a settlement for certain purposes in the possession and under the protection of his majesty but not within the territory and dominion of his majestyhave always been very complex the settlement was regarded in london as being a place where british subjects had the right to cut timber but which nevertheless was under spanish sovereignty however fitfully and ineffectually that was exercised through the captains general of yucatan not until  was the first superintendent in the bay of honduras appointed as crown representative by the british governor in jamaica not until  did britain officially create british honduras a colony  pp     the principal barrier to the country independence today stems from this old constitutional problem guatemala claiming by the doctrine of uti possidetis that she inherited spanish sovereignty over the area and that belice is a department of the republic of guatemala  pp   in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries control over the affairs of the settlement was divided between the superintendent and the local settlers the superintendent powers were not great and his authority could not be increased while the authorities in whitehall persisted in denying that the british had anything more than usufructuary rights in the bay as late as  a colonial office memorandum described the superintendent as not much more than a looker on and who supplies the want of authority by dexterity and address in acquiring and using influence over the general meeting and the magistracy real power in the settlement was vested in the public meeting of the settlers the qualifications for membership varied at different periods but it is roughly true to say that it represented the monied section of the community including free men of color and was a lot closer to athenian ideas of democracy than most other modern governments for most practical purposes the power of the public meeting was delegated to the seven magistrates who were elected from its members  pp   in the very small british settlement at the town of belize there was little call for printing at an early stage the government and the trade of the bay settlements came through jamaica and one may safely assume that if standard printed proformas for such things as laborers agreements and bills of lading were required in the settlement they would have been provided from jamaica as late as  when a number of the more powerful settlers in belize were incensed by a report to parliament by colonel arthur an exsuperintendent who had criticized their position over slavery they had to
 the library quarterly have their defence of the settlers of honduras against the unjust and undefended representations of colonel george arthur printed for them by alexander aikman jr in kingston jamaica for subsequent distribution to members of parliament in london it may be speculated that it was as a result of this special order for printing from jamaica with the difficulties and expense caused by having the work done at such a distance that the need for a press in belize was felt to be urgent in colonel arthur evidence to the house of commons the settlement had been described as the most detestable spot on the face of the globe  p  this was not the best publicity for a territory anxious to encourage immigration and the early productions of the belize press were certainly designed to show that the settlement was better than arthur had suggested in the west indian islands under british rule printing was introduced in a number of different ways in the eighteenth century in jamaica where robert baldwin started printing in  the impetus seems to have come partly from the house of assembly but above all from the governor sir nicholas lawes who was of the opinion that a press there would be a publick convenience and advantage to commerce baldwin was induced to come not only as a printer licensed to the governor to undertake official printing on a contractual basis but also as able to undertake private ventures on his own behalf as well  in barbados on the other hand david harry set up office as a printer in  as a normal commercial venture  and this was to be the more common pattern in most of the larger and more prosperous island colonies although in some like tobago in  it was only the inducement of public support which made the introduction of printing a reasonable venture to undertake  in belize the situation was closer to that in jamaica a century earlier with printing starting not because a printer arrived but because local pressure caused a printer to be sent for no doubt the guarantee of official support was necessary to persuade a printer to come to belize at all for in  ten years after the first introduction of printing the total population of the settlement including slaves was under   p  and the commercial prospects for a printer were not very promising local pressure came from some of the magistrates of the settlement who had begun to plan for the new press in belize by the fall of  on december   at a meeting of the magistrates it was ordered that a printing apparatus should be procured without delay so that the records and laws of the settlement could be printed  p  no records survive to show what kind of printing apparatus was thus procured with public funds there seems little doubt that for letterpress work it was an iron press of the stanhopecolumbianalbion variety imported from britain the presswork of the earliest productions is excellent bearing comparison with good english provincial work of the period and in general far superior to that prevailing in belize later in the century the choice of types was such as would have been made by an english newspaper cum

 the library quarterly are characteristic of such compilations a historical account of the settlement calendar list of superintendents of sovereigns of europe of the civil and military establishment in belize conversion tables directions for mariners navigating to the coast of honduras and so forth the last  page section deals with the honduras society for the propogation of christian knowledge which had been established in  and i suspect that it was also issued separately from the almanack its production costs being underwritten by another source the plates are an unsigned chart of the private signals of the merchants of belize and a view of st john church this and the engraved title were both signed a  s sc the paper is an unwatermarked wove the text types typical scotch romans of the period and evidently new as early as december   the secretary of state for the colonies had requested that two copies of the almanack be forwarded to him each year  the superintendent letter of transmittal was dated march    eight days before the date of publication named in subsequent issues of the almanack the  almanack was also printed by cruickshank and advertised by him for sale on february   at  copies of the  volume being offered at half price the same engraved title leaf suitably corrected in the plate was used there was also a fresh folding plate of the merchants private signals and as frontispiece a further copper engraving of the manner of trucking mahogany in honduras signed a bayntun del the text of   iv  iv pages shows considerable change from the previous issue including a long and useful account of the methods used in the timber trade there was also an editorial request that addenda and corrigenda should be notified to the office of the keeper of the records or to the residences of john waldron wright or thomas pickstock some  subscribers to the volume are listed andrew bayntun keeper of the records was a public notary and assistant to the clerk of the courts both wright and pickstock were merchants and magistrates together with william walsh the public treasurer it seems almost certain that they formed the editorial body to which the public meeting of march   expressed appreciation according to the account given in the honduras gazette of march   resolved unanimously that the thanks of this meeting be given to the gentlemen who have hitherto conducted the compilation and publication of the honduras almanack and they are hereby requested to accept the same accordingly and should the subscription not be adequate to the expence that this public should make good the deficiency i have not seen a copy of the  almanack the only copy traced lacks title leaf and prelims but has one plate an unsigned lithograph of the courthouse of belize  copy in the british library  in the royal commonwealth society london

 the library quarterly and nothing shall be left undone on our part to accomplish the object the editors continued by enlarging on the advantages of a newspaper stressing their intention to be impartial after a request that their venture should be patronized they went on we feel satisfied that our present endeavour humble as it may be will raise us in the scale of the british colonies it will preserve our rights encrease our commerce and improve our rising generation let us therefore ever remember that the liberty of the press is the palladium of all the rights civil religious and politicalwhich nations or communities enjoy the honduras gazeyte will be published weekly at eight dollars per annum payable in advance or lsd belizean currency each number subscribers residing in the interior may have it delivered to their agents in town the paper will be issued every saturday morning advertisements or other matter intended for insertion can only be introduced if sent on or before the preceding thursday advertisements will be inserted once at the rate of fifreen shillings for twelve lines or less and for greater lengths in proportion payment of the first year subscription will be received during the present week by william walsh esq the content of the paper the normal issues of which were of  pages approximately   x   inches each of  columns was very similar to that of most west indian papers of the period shipping intelligence overseas news culled from the english american and west indian papers brought by the latest vessels to call at the settlement merchants advertisements government proclamations some literary matter and local news because of the very close interest the baymen took in the decidedly unsettled affairs of the neighboring central american republics considerable attention was devoted by the gazette to reports received from guatemala el salvador and honduras this was to be a continuing pattern for belize papers on several occasions subscribers received free of charge supplements to the regular paper usually these contained proclamations and other government matter plus additional advertisements squeezed out of the regular edition but on occasion the supplement was of foreign news just received in the settlement that for august   for instance contained a list of candidates in the forthcoming parliamentary election in britain at the rather high price charged for the honduras gazette its circulation in the settlement cannot have been very large but with a substantial income derived from advertising it probably paid its way some copies no doubt  the sum of  belize equaled s sterling unless otherwise stated all references are to belize currency which until stabilized in  was liable to fluctuate considerably as did the mongrel currency common to the other central american states which also circulated in belize  because of local currency fluctuations it is very difficult to compare with other colonial papers but writing in  simmonds  quoted subscription rates of   for weeklies in the eastern caribbean  s d for jamaican dailies in jamaica a high cost colony
printing in belize  circulated to the british settlements in the bay islands and on the mosquito coast that there was a demand for the paper is shown by the fact that in the issue for march   cruickshank was offering  each for copies of some  different issues he needed to complete sets for subscribers in england and the united states undoubtedly from the earliest days of the honduras gazette cruickshank had some part in its editorial production but he was quick to take refuge behind authority when it suited him as on july   to correspondents aul pry who informs us he should just like to pop in and take a eep at our printing office is informed that by doing so he would greatly ntrude as no person whatever can be admitted to the interior except on special business without an order in writing from the magistrates government by committee is bad enough editorship by committee an abomination and particularly so in a small community where the editors can be made accountable by those who dislike their editorial direction in the report of the public meeting of march   given in the issue for march   cruickshank recorded that mr coffin    desired mr westby to read the notice of his motion in regard to the printing establishment which enables us to supply the public with the information and in consequence of the proceedings that followed we are not sory to say is no longer a public but a private establishment but we shall be most happy at all times to employ it in the manner which may be most conducive to the public weal    esolved that the public will not from this time be liable to any further charge of or expense arising from the printing establishment of this settlement except the contracts already entered into but that the present printer shall be allowed the use of the printing press during the pleasure of the public the motion was seconded by mr maskall and carried unanimously the first period of belizean journalism with what was in effect a statecontrolled newspaper was over the settlement seemed to be moving closer to the pattern of the west indian islands with a printerproprietor in sole charge of a paper direction interference with the liberty of the press was of course common enough in the other colonies in some printers could be chased out of the colony for criticizing the governor too freely in others printers were harassed by the house of assembly for breach of privilege or by overfree recourse to libel actions more subtly papers could be killed or brought to heel by the withholding of government advertising cruickadvertisements of moderate length cost s per week or s for a month insertions in the weekly papers in the turks islands a similar rate was charged in the s the charge in belize therefore seems distinctly high  as happened to two bermuda printers edmund ward dismissed by governor cockburn in  and charles beach ousted by governor lumley in   pp    the fate of several jamaican printers   pp    in st lucia the press was stifled for nearly five years   by these means  pp  while in the turks islands in the s both papers were at different times disciplined by this method 
 the library quarterly shank who was allowed the use of the belize press during the pleasure of the public was in a peculiarly vulnerable position and as pickstock records did not enjoy this right very long the intemperence to which pickstock referred was not of course drunkenness few officials would have lasted long in the west indies one gathers had this been regarded as serious but rather an outspokenness which was found objectionable by enough members of the public meeting to have him removed from office after the issue of the honduras gazette of november   the new series of the paper at first bore the imprint printed and published at the honduras gazette office for the editor later this became printed and published by henry whitney pickstock set of the newspaper ceases with the issue of june   which may have been the last issue published cruickshank other work as well as printing the almanack and the gazette cruickshank was a jobbing printer from time to time advertising the usual range of blank proformas for bills of lading powers of attorney manifests laborers agreements and the like he also published a comprehensive interest table advertised on november   for publication on saturday next price d the gazette of february   contained an advertisement for two responsible lads as apprentices it is tempting to see his successors at the printing establishment whitney and lindo in these apprentices like most printers in pioneering areas cruickshank business interests were diversified he was a binder a stationer and a bookseller advertising stock in both english and spanish who attempted to attack the feminine market by importing the ladies magazine and other suitable reading he had an interest in a hotel and in the running of the olympic theatre on april   he advertised that he intended opening a well supplied newspaper and general reading room on liberal terms provided he receives adequate encouragement gentlemen therefore wishing to patronize it will oblige him by sending in their names there is no evidence surviving as to the success of this venture which would no doubt have been the first subscription library in belize nor after his loss of favor later that year is there any evidence for cruickshank later career later printers in belize as in all the west indian colonies the printers of british honduras for a long time were dependent upon the production of a newspaper to provide a backbone for their business apart from newspaper printing and contract work for the government there was little chance of great commercial success in the declining state of the colony in the second half of the century even then it
printing in belize  was a meager living and many of the later newspaper proprietors were also merchants or hotel keepers from files of belizean papers which have survived it is possible to create a reasonably complete list of the printers of the settlement given as appendix i henry whitney cruickshank successor in producing the honduras gazette seems to have enjoyed a monopoly of printing in the settlement throughout the s on september   he commenced publication of the belize advertiser a weekly paper which peter l simmonds who had a good knowledge of the west indian press described as likely to last in a paper on newspaper printing which he read to the statistical society of london in   but at the time simmonds delivered his paper there was already a rival paper being published in the settlement the honduras observer which had started publication on november   there can hardly be room for two papers here was simmonds observation and a correct one some time in  the belize advertiser ceased publication and whitney went out of business it may have been succeeded by the belize gazette a weekly published by e cramond which started soon after the honduras observer john m daly the printer of the observer was the longest lasting of belize printers in the nineteenth century though like many of his contemporaries elsewhere he was associated with several different papers at different times as early as november  daly had fallen foul of the superintendent by attacking the local government in the columns of the observer superintendents had much less power than governors of colonies and superintendent mcdonald was unsure what action he could take against the paper in the absence of everything in the shape of a law authority here he wrote rather plaintively to the secretary of state for the colonies asking advice on how to deal with these attacks and enclosed copies of the offending paper and also of the belize gazette  vol  p  the reply when it came eighteen months later reflected a more liberal approach to criticism than many colonial governors would have liked  april  jamaican governor to superintendent i entirely concur with sir charles metcalfe in recommending a disregard of false attacks in the newspapers unless they be so serious as to render legal proceedings unavoidable however annoying it may be to faithful public servants to find their actions and motives misinterpreted and however considerable the temporary inconvenience which the public service may sustain from such false attacks i am of opinion that a recurrence to forcible measures of repression has a tendency to produce evils of greater magnitude nor can i doubt that justice will ultimately be done to those who exhibit forbearance and maintain a calm and dignified demeanour under such inflictions ibid only the first few volumes of the honduras observer were both printed and published by daly in march  henry gunter became the paper proprietor with daly continuing to print it as before but by november of the same
