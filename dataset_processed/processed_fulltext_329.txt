cost accounting for libraries acquisition and cataloging robert a miller m t  any types of facts have value in the administration of an enterprise of the many types however cost facts are most commonly needed for the determination of costs in industry and business the specialized techniques of cost accounting were perfected these techniques have been adapted to the peculiar problems of cost measurement in nonprofit enterprises notably municipal government and education libraries no less than other types of educational and nonprofit institutions require facts for purposes of management while service statistics have been collected by libraries for many years there has seldom been any attempt to express these services in terms of cost or to measure service against cost or quality or any other criterion standards of library service and performance that do exist have been the subject of criticism within and without the profession these experts     consider them inadequate for the purposes which they are intended to serve they insist that these standards do not reveal the exact unit costs of different activities that they cannot be used effectively in measuring efficiency of operation and that they do not greatly aid the library administrator in shaping and directing the policies of his library or in understanding the interests and meeting the needs of individuals and special groups furthermore they say they do not enable the taxpayer to know whether the services provided through the library are worth what they cost what they actually mean is that libraries do not have devices at present by which they the trend in municipal service has been well summarized in t h reed municipal government in the united states new york appleton century co  pp   techniques of cost accounting in institutions of higher learning are illustrated in the national committee on standard reports for institutions of higher education financial reportsfor colleges and universities chicago university of chicago press i and in many studies of which j d russell efficiency in college management bulletin of the school of education vol vi no  bloomington ind indiana university i is an excellent example i
 the library quarterly can accurately measure their administrative effectiveness or social significance the next ten years will witness the development of a body of costs and measurements for various types of library service which will meet these adverse criticisms and enable the library to justify its support upon a basis of substantial facts rather than of unproven assumptions to a philosophy of action and specific objectives will be added accurate measures of performance all of which are essential to sustained progressive achievement yet questions on the cost of library operations and library services have been of continuing interest to the library profession if one may judge from the attention given to questions of cost in library periodicals and reports from this attention one infers that cost data can be of use to the library administrator if the data are exact and sufficiently analyzed the librarian is better equipped therewith to plan and review the financial program of his organization he enjoys a clearer view of the relative expenditures for each part of the library plant and consequently can more clearly appraise the value of each part to the whole and compute the proportionate financial outlay the advisability of contemplated changes in practice or the merit of a given policy can often be better understood when the essential facts of cost have been determined in planning future programs or the coming year work as in a budget the librarian should find analyzed costs helpful for they will enable him to predict the financial burden that each cost examined operation will carry in reporting annual progress he will be able to use unit costs for brief comparisons because they offer a convenient statement of financial data and history and are as easily understood as stated efficiency demands that the library organization be well planned that functions be well organized and that operations be grouped as to function each process or series of operations will necessarily be routinized to a large extent in the typical library it is common to find that this has been done to one who would seek to know the organization thoroughly it would seem proper to inquire next if the costs of the routinized operations had been determined and if they had been totaled into a cost for an entire service or for the complete function with  l r wilson the next fifty years library journal lxi  
cost accounting for libraries i cost of the operation or series of operations determined it would be pertinent to inquire if maximum efficiency in the performance of the operation had been reached not until maximum efficiency has been reached or indicated can a complete evaluation of the operation be made measurement is thus of two kinds the first being antecedent to the second unless an operation or service has been measured in terms of cost the cost of the operation or service cannot be measured against a criterion of quality or other standard libraries are generally lacking in both kinds of measurement this investigation is concerned with the former or cost measurement for not until this type of measurement has been established can the more critical judgments be made a demonstration of a cost finding technique to cover all items of cost for all library operations is not attempted in this study this has recently been done by mr rider the unit costs that he and earlier investigators have reported however have been so inclusive as to obscure the differences in process and in type of material that demand measurement and comparison in other words analyzed costs promise to be most useful professional catalogers recognized this fact in i when they brought forward a plan for a cost determination of cataloging in its different processes the main purpose of this investigation is to prove that the analysis of costs is feasible in undertaking this study it has been necessary to impose certain limitations which may be briefly stated the technical processes acquisition and cataloging excluding all binding operations were selected as significant in point of cost and process cataloging costs particularly have been the subject of much interest and speculation the routines for the technical processes especially in reference and research libraries are complex and if they prove susceptible to analyzed cost determination there would appear to be reason for an extension of costaccounting techniques to other library routines as mr rider has indicated labor costs appear to be the crux  fremont rider library cost accounting library quarterly vi   i   plan for an investigation into and report on the cost of cataloging bulletin of the american library association xix   
 the library quarterly of the entire cost question it is only necessary to maintain proper records and employ proper arithmetical and accounting practices to distinguish the other items of cost material and overhead because the procedures in calculating material and overhead costs have been well established in industrial cost accounting and because the mechanics of the distribution of these costs to total library costs have been illustrated by mr rider they are omitted in this study to arrive at the detailed costs of the technical processes in any library it is necessary to routinize the operations completely by doing so the significant points of cost and process can be discerned the development of time sheets on which to record labor time at these points logically follows the time expenditures cumulated on such sheets can be totaled and divided by total output to give unit times time expenditures can also be translated into labor costs and expressed in terms of unit costs in brief then this is the procedure followed in this investigation applied specifically to a large university library hereafter called the test library which is assumed to be typical on the basis of evidence at hand organization of the technical processes in the test library and significant points of cost aicquisitionacquisition activities were centralized in the order department of the test library for all types of book acquisition except exchange and for much of the work connected with serial continuation and document acquisition the departments for serial and document service aided in acquiring their respective types of material by checking the order for duplication and by supplying trade and bibliographical infor mation the routines for receipt of serials continuations and documents were complicated in some instances because both order and service departments maintained checking files to understand therefore the interrelationships of the departments sharing in acquisition processes it proved convenient to routinize the work as to type of material namely book serial and document differences in routine also appeared as to meth

si  the library quarterly the cost of ordering a document to be purchased the cost of receiving a purchased document the cost of ordering a document received free the cost of receiving a free document interesting as these costs would appear to be it proved impractical throughout the test library to separate acquisition time according to types of material thus while time spent in the service departments for the acquisition of serials and documents might be charged directly to the acquisition of a single type of material in the order department the work was not organized in such a way as to separate labor time by type of material handled it was assumed that cost differences occasioned by differences in material were not significant the same assumption was applied to the differences in the method of acquisition in other words all units of work book serial or document purchased or free were regarded as requiring equal attention in the order department there were nevertheless significant points or groupings of labor time in the order and receipt routines examination of the routine for purchased books the base routine revealed five suggestive categories order card received order card stamped preliminary order card marked by department activities order card placed in preliminary file unchecked order cards alphabetized order cards checked against catalog order cards checked against orders out file checking order cards checked against orders received order cards checked against ready to order order cards prepared bibliographically order cards filed in ready to order order cards sorted as to agent order cards typed into order letters ordering order letters revised and mailed order cards stamped and filed

i the library quarterly how much does it cost to discover duplication in total what burden does the library assume because of the book selector lack of acquaintance with the library collections and from what quarters does the burden arise even more pertinent are the questions that arise concerning the cost of preparing the order with the bibliographical information that will aid the agent in locating the exact title desired and in some instances assist the cataloger in her work the policy of the test library was to check all order cards carefully as to the information they carried in at least one other university library this check is not made it being assumed that the selector has correctly transcribed the author and title of the book together with such trade and bibliographical information as was available to him how much therefore does the test library pay for this painstaking search how many duplications are found later in the cataloging processes for in the test library the cataloging routines showed that much searching and checking of a similar nature was done segregation of time spent by catalogers in this type of activity provided evidence of duplication of effort while the grouping of operations and the recording of time on each group do not answer these questions completely they serve as a starting point for what would appear to be interesting studies information of this type should be helpful in the efficient administration of the technical processes any analysis or isolation of cost offers needed insight the separation of these two groups of operations from the others that constitute the whole of the ordering process naturally defined the remaining activities into two groups the preliminary activities and the concluding activities the latter being termed herein ordering receiving activities were considered as a whole a time sheet constructed to furnish the order department personnel with a form for the recording of time spent only in the five categories of acquisition operations would omit many other allied activities not only for the convenience of workers in the allocation of their time to a specific object but also to

cost accounting for libraries  ing technique isolate points of possible difference comparison is facilitated by such an analysis the third operation suggested for separate calculation was the establishment of difficult editions much that has been said above with respect to main entries is pertinent to editions although with libraries of the same type and approximate size it is likely that policy and costs will show some agreement with respect to policy and cost of analyzing another point of possible difference was emphasized libraries differ greatly on policies pursued in relation to analytics and the extent to which they are employed the isolation of time spent in analyzing was repeated under the cost examination of added volume serial work assigning classification numbers and subject headings appeared as one of the main dinvsions in the cataloging process perhaps the cost of no single group of operations within the entire cataloging process has been the subject of so much conjecture some large libraries have gone so far as to make a division of labor at this point establishing a subdivision within the cataloging department for assigning classification numbers and subject headings to items whether such an organization is more economical in dollars and cents than one in which one person carries the item through all operations cannot be answered concretely until the costs are determined for both types of organization in a strictly controlled experiment it is clear of course that where one worker carries the item through all cataloging operations there is difficulty in defining closely the time that is given to classification and subject heading operations and to no other activity for in examining the book for one purpose other information comes to light nevertheless the approximate labor time and labor cost promised to be useful as a fact in library management an extraneous operation the preparation of added entries was included in this grouping of operations as a local convenience the group of operations summarized as completion of cataloging brings together the concluding activities in the catalog
 the library quarterly ing process excluding revision these operations ordinarily formed a compact piece of work following the cataloging process proper came two types of revision each of which was separate in point of time from the main operations and thus conveniently isolated revision of cataloging was undertaken in the test library by designated workers who devoted consecutive time to the task time records therefore for the labor cost of cataloging revision were simply kept it would have been desirable to secure at the same time a record of the time spent by catalogers in correction a possible objective measurement for the evaluation of the efficiency of the individual worker difficulties in keeping the time however prevented this record being kept in the test library the second revision operation the revision of card work was undertaken in the test library by the cataloger originally responsible for the work because of its separation in point of time from the cataloging process and because this type of revision was customarily done on a quantity of cards in a single period of time it was set aside for cost determination the mechanics of reproducing the operations established above on a time sheet and the method for subdividing them into categories for new books new serials recataloged books and recataloged serials may be seen in figure  each time sheet has columns for the six work days of the week each of these is further divided into columns headed new and recataloged because each worker was to keep her own record and because no cataloger in the test library dealt with both types of material book and serial there was no confusion in distinguishing between book and serial time records had one cataloger dealt with both books and serials it would have been necessary for her to have kept separate time sheets one for books and one for serials analysis of the other processes of cataloging was not carried out on the time sheet beyond separating them from the routines just analyzed thus a single heading sufficed for short form cataloging because certain operations in the different processes

 the library quarterly the weekly totals varied with the expected weekly total in the time charges therefore this meant that overtime was being charged to the exact category of work on which it took place but that undertime was not being recorded a separate account was established in the tabulation therefore for overtime and undertime for purposes of adjustment undertime including added vacation time for illness and conference privileges was considered an administrative charge and was calculated in the operating costs undertime in the form of regular vacation was not an administrative charge under the method employed in determining the hourly rate of pay in the accounting overtime was considered a correction item on undertime the specific amount of administrative charge for undertime was thus total undertime less regular vacation accounts less overtime as with other time segregations net undertime was expressed in dollars and cents few difficulties were experienced in the final tabulations as it was not the purpose of the study to present cost figures which might be interpreted as standards only a few of the resulting totals will be given tables i  these totals are intended to testify only to the effectiveness of the records employed it will be noted that unit times as well as unit costs are presented for cataloging costs the one was as easily computed as the other unit times are perhaps less meaningful than unit costs at the present writing but there is reason to believe that they will assume importance in any comparison in which salary differences must be adjusted the possibility of expressing accurately in terms of a single unit the cumulated costs of all acquisition work proved to be remote because of the differences arising in the different types of material acquired table i shows that in the order department the cost of receiving a piece was  the service department for documents received  free pieces at a labor cost of  per piece but only  pieces were forwarded to the order department the service department for serials received  pieces at an approximate labor cost of  per piece but only  serial pieces were received in the order de

 the library quarterly ment there is however at least one reference library so large as to have subdivided its cataloging organization into two sections one for the cataloging of books having library of congress cards and the other for the cataloging of books lacking library of congress cards direct labor times or direct labor costs with salary differences equated gathered over an extended period of time and for strictly defined operations in organizations of this type would aid in a definitive answer to the question a final answer however must take into account and equate the differences in the difficulty of the books cataloged by each method it is likely that differences in subject content and language will make for cost differences in the cataloging of new books such a differentiation was not approached in this investigation comparative studies which will be discussed below may be dependent upon differences of this kind the consolidations of operations necessary to the construction of the time sheets employed in this investigation may also be made the subject of an intensive study as pointed out the technical operations are composed of many work elements each of which is sufficiently distinct in character to be studied albeit by the stop watch method the techniques of time and motion studies might be profitably adapted to the examination of the most efficient method for the performance of specific work elements this line of thought carries one into the larger field of scientific management a field in which little has been done for libraries and for their peculiar problems studies are needed on fatigue physical and mental the suggested benefits of the interchange of personnel from department to department and from task to task need description and validation that the traditional organization and planning of the technical processes may not be entirely effective has been suggested specifically in this study with respect to the searching activities the needs for facts on cost are not limited of course to the technical processes service operations require careful cost determination and study the proposals concerning time and mo
cost accounting for libraries  tion studies and other problems of management may be extended to any library activity all of these problems come to a focus in the need that exists for standards of cost that measure performance one of the objectives of the early cataloging test was the establishment of a standard cost figure since that time the temptation to use published figures as criteria has been obvious despite the fact that the figures may have been compiled under definitions and conditions that make comparison bootless only when conditions and procedures of work have been carefully described so that legitimate comparisons on this score may be made between libraries and when the quality of performance is much the same can the differences in cost be used to measure the efficiency of the organization and of the personnel comparisons of cost figures are frequently made in the fields of municipal service and education in the latter field attempts have been made to establish criteria of quality and standards of reasonable cost for certain functions russell in a study of effective and ineffective expenditures in colleges devised a technique that is highly suggestive for the establishment of a standard cost for any library operation to illustrate the technique let it be assumed that a standard unit cost or a standard unit time for the cataloging of new books is desired if unit costs and unit times strictly defined and tabulated were collected for a sample of libraries assumed to be or limited by being similar in type and function these facts could be arranged in a distribution by libraries ranging from highest time to lowest time from highest cost to lowest cost if over against this distribution a ranking of the libraries on the basis of excellence in cataloging was made and unsatisfactory performance indicated for those libraries doing poor work a standard could be set up by noting the lowest unit cost or unit time at which satisfactory performance was possible libraries having higher figures would be f w reeves and j d russell the measurement of college excellence bulletin of the bureau of school service vol  no  lexington ky university of kentucky college of education i  russell op cit
 the library quarterly charged with ineffective expenditure libraries with lower figures would not be producing a standard grade of cataloging the dependence of this technique upon a criterion of satisfactory performance indicates that a needed preliminary would be the definition of performance excellence in cataloging or other library activity may rest upon objective features that will define performance but it seems likely to draw a parallel from education that these features cannot be validated except by expert subjective judgment if there is to be any practical value from comparative studies certain precautions governing the execution of the studies and their use may be emphasized the failure of unit cost studies   may be due in part at least to the following facts first the lack of an adequate and accurate procedure in conducting the studies second the failure properly to interpret cost figures third and perhaps of most significance the failure to realize that merely the determination of unit costs does not solve financial and administrative problemsxo so national committee on standard reports for institutions of higher education op cit p
