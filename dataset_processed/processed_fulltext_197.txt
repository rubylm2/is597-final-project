broadening concerns for intellectual freedom everett t moore perhaps we librarians pragmatists that we are have not been very successful at defining intellectual freedom we have been concerned largely with the practical problems that face us when our policies of book selection or our principles of access to books and libraries are questioned from without perhaps we have appeared to react hypersensitively to such questionings and to be too ready to consider them attacks on our professional abilities or prerogatives perhaps we have been touchy over the question of where book selection ends and censorship begins perhaps we have seemed self righteous and lofty when we have stood on our rights and quoted the library bill of rights as our scripture whatever the causes for such an image as may have developed in the public mind this is a good time to consider how we may overcome it not by seeking to change our visage in madison avenue fashion but by probing more thoroughly into what our concerns are wherever they touch on our intellectual freedom does the expression intellectual freedom offend is it snobbish when we use it does it wall us off from many of the very people to whom we want to endear ourselves are government officials legislators community leaders put off by such a high sounding term we have asked these questions among ourselves and among our friends over and over they have bothered some of us deeply for there is no question but that the very invoking of principles of intellectual freedom has offended some of those people whom we should be doing everything in our power to reach and so there have been frequent urgings that we come down to earth and give up referring to our intellectual freedom as if we were some superior breed and that we employ the language of the market place as more fitting to our interest in serving all manner of people not just the intellectuals if we are worried about censorship then let talk about censorship and not beat about the bush why wave the red flag of intellectualism in the faces of some of our best friends commendable as it is to call a spade a spade this is far from the mark for we are of course not concerned only with censorship but with a broad range of matters affecting our freedom to act and to fulfil our responsibilities as librarians according to our lights we need to look more fully into what ought to be included in our concept of intellectual freedom because keeping the printed word is the main business of librarians we are naturally and properly perturbed about any placing of power in the hands of officials to restrict our freedom to select books and other materials for our libraries the wielding of such power is censorship as traditionally defined and a healthy fear of the censor is something we like to think has been bred into us not only as librarians but as good citizens true we are sometimes advised that every time we select or reject a book we exercise censorship it does not 
 the library quarterly satisfy those who so advise to say that our intentions are not to exert moral or political judgment over what our library should or should not have but to select within the limits of our budgets what we believe will best serve the needs and broadest interests of our readers too much it may seem is left to our human judgment frail as it sometimes is but once confidence has been imposed in us by those who employ us is there any other way reasonably to fulfil professional duties where confidence is lacking the urge to censor takes hold it is true also that in an earlier time some of our library leaders saw themselves as censors as guardians of morals and therefore as having an obligation to reject whatever appeared harmful for readers to read that was the position of the president of the american library association arthur e bostwick in  when he said that the librarian must shun the books that distinctly commend what is wrong that teach how to sin and how pleasant sin is not all subjects he thought were fit for fiction though the french seemed to have been acting upon such a thesis mr bostwick had been wrestling with the canons of decency of his times and had had some sleepless nights over them not only because they are so frequently confounded with canons of morality but because  they are arbitrary and variable for some time now we have rejected any thought that we should exercise moral judgment in the selection of books quite representative of our dominant viewpoint today is the statement made to the press by a librarian defending her recommendation not to buy norman mailer novel why are we in vietnam she had to explain carefully that it was not because of the author use of obscene language or his political views but because she considered it a very poor book    badly written boring repetitious and of no discernible literary or social value this librarian did not shy away from exercising judgment on literary grounds she disowned any intent to judge on the basis of possible offense to moral sensitivities or political viewpoint certainly this is not the view of every librarian in the united states there are those who feel that the library profession in general and the ala in particular have gone astray in their stand on intellectual freedom they do not believe that librarians should give young people free access to certain materials in the library they do not welcome the broadening of the library bill of rights to read that the rights of an individual to the use of a library should not be denied because of his age race religion national origin or social or political views as was accepted by the ala in  the question of whether some materials may be harmful to readers particularly to minors is still an open one and is even now undergoing official study by the commission on obscenity and pornography created by an act of the ninetieth congress the viewpoint of the dissenters is given some support by the ruling of the us supreme court on april   upholding a new york state law that regulates the sale of harmful books magazines photographs and other materials to minors under the age of seventeen the power of the state to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the scope of its authority over adults justice william j brennan said speaking for the majority but justice william  douglas a dissenter from the decision believes that the court has set

 the library quarterly whose confiscation of a copy of paris review from the library was a kind of gesture of contempt that accompanied his systematic harassment and intimidation of the library staff and his obstructing of all plans for development of the library it is tragic that librarians should be so involved in this kind of wasteful struggle when the times demand more and more involvement in efforts to solve the serious social problems that face the country the most severe test of our commitment to intellectual freedom is likely to come in the near future if it is not already on us when libraries will surely become concerned more than ever with the issues of the social revolution we are undergoing those who fear social change already fear the library but it is usually a vague uncomprehending fear of ideas a feeling that people in general cannot safely be turned loose in this jungle of dangerous thoughts this has been demonstrated mainly in the denunciations of librarians by rightwing extremists for what they consider deliberate favoring of left wing viewpoints in their book selection policies with a propensity for reducing political and social concepts to simple black or white the right wingers have condemned librarians in communities from the atlantic to the pacific for selecting the writings of liberal authors over those of conservatives for failing to give a fair hearing to the ideas and principles of free enterprise as opposed to those of socialism or big government ism they have suspected that librarians have been captured by the left wing forces which gain a better hearing because they control the big city press the major publishing houses and most of the national magazines of news and opinion major battles fought along this line in a number of communities have illustrated the fears that build up in people minds when they believe a library is deliberately refusing to represent their viewpoint in the books and magazines they select perhaps the most thorough answer to this charge of bias was given in the case of the long beach california public library where the librarian was able to demonstrate in public hearing to the satisfaction of the city council at least that a conscientious policy of attention to a broad range of interests and viewpoints from left to right liberal to conservative nonconformist to conformist or whatever pairing of poles one may propose had been followed in selecting materials no one claims this to be an easy task robert h muller has recently shown in his publication from radical left to extreme right how extensive and diverse is the periodical literature of protest controversy or dissent in the united states john n berry had previously found through questioning  public libraries a striking lack of representation of a sampling of extremist publications in their collections and an apparent unconcern for making them available to their readers he concluded that public libraries were clinging cautiously to the middle of the road in their selection policies with respect to these out of the ordinary publications both mr berry and mr muller point out the obligation librarians have to provide such materials if the library is truly to be a forum for dissenting views muller bibliography meticulously and  robert h muller ed from radical left to extreme right current periodicals of protest controversy or dissent usa ann arbor mich campus publishers   john n berry iii demand for dissent library journal october
