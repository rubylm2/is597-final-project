thematic mapping data mapping and geocoding techniques  figure  thematic maps shades graduated symbol and dot density maps show ranges of data here census block groups are shaded based on their total population in the next example figure  map  graduated symbols are used to show three levels of population size the point symbols dots increase in size as the underlying population data increases in a block group dot density maps are commonly used to show population density in this case the block groups are filled with dots and the number of dots within a block group depends on the size of the population depending on the particular mapping software there are other thematic mapping methods figure  left illustrates how pie charts can be used to show the male and female population distribution by block group in this example the size of the pie chart indicates levels of total population so that two dimensions sex and population size are combined in one symbol finally it is possible to plot individual values such as the responses to a survey question in figure  right responses to a categorical survey question asking how often the respondent visits the library are plotted for each respondent the color of the dot indicates the specific response eg red means several times a week and blue means about once a week the resulting map shows not only the dispersion of respondents across the geographic landscape but also shows clustering if and when it is present fall

thematic mapping data mapping and geocoding techniques  literacy to reiterate preparing thematic maps that reveal correct unbiased information is a difficult task and not one to be taken lightly data maps demographic analysis for the purpose of library planning is one possible application of gis techniques in  this author constructed a series of planning maps for a county library that were intended to define service areas for branch libraries and to provide maps and raw data on census data felt to be of importance to local branch heads historically the branches of the county library have used data that were tied to municipal lines some attempts were made to use census tract information to provide more detailed analysis but these were usually abandoned due to the difficulties in summarizing the information without the use of computers it was felt that the capabilities of gis could be used to explore planning at the micro level by utilizing census data at the block group level  the level of greatest detail for a wide variety of variables in this instance each branch head seventeen in all defined a service area by employing ordinary road maps the branch heads were encouraged to think not about municipal lines but about where people lived  that is at the neighborhood level the boundaries they established were then transferred to computer maps if a boundary established by a branch head crossed through a census block group area the branch head was asked if he or she wanted to include or exclude that block group further if a branch head changed his or her mind about the initial map generated the boundaries could be changed with relatively little effort once the boundaries for a service area are determined all the block groups within those boundaries can be identified as belonging to that service area this can be done rather easily by the mapping program it involves invoking a formula that requires one to select all from within the specified boundary census data can then be joined to these selected block groups via a relational database approach where the census file and the map file contain a common identifier in this case the common identifier was a number constructed from the county census tract and block group numbers the maps of the block group polygons can be purchased privately for a county or assembled from the census bureau tiger files the process of constructing polygons from tiger files can be difficult but specialized software is available to simplify the process in the branch service area study twenty seven demographic variables were collected from the us census stf a report each variable was selected by the library staff on the basis that it revealed information about certain planning assumptions the mapping software was used to construct a demographic summary for the entire county figure  then a map was prepared for each branch chosen service area showing the service area boundaries figure  the software quickly calculated the demographic summary data the next step was to plot the actual numerical data for each demographic variable on a map of block groups figure  in all a total of twenty seven maps of the demographic variables were made these data maps were prepared for five regions of the county to isolate the data for a given branch service area transparency overlays fall

thematic mopping data mapping and geocoding techniques  given the intent of the planning study the software allows the computation of correlation and regression measures but these features were not used in this study the maps and data were only intended to be used locally in the practical task of developing master plans for presentation to local groups since the statistical sophistication of the local users is not great analysis was kept to simple description geocoding geocoding is the process of assigning longitude and latitude coordinates to records these records can be the home or office of a library patron the street addresses of churches social agencies or businesses or the center of a region such as a zip code or municipality gis software has automated a great deal of the work of geocoding although as discussed below there are still difficulties to overcome street address geocoding offers many opportunities for research and investigation placing pins on maps to show where people live has long been a useful technique computerized mapping makes this more accurate  accurate to within feet of its location  and can handle greater numbers of cases than a paper map with pins combined with thematic mapping techniques and distance computation geocoded records are a valuable set of data data from a survey of library patrons can be used to illustrate some of the opportunities that geocoded data afford the researcher and planner these data consist of registration records from the library circulation control system a count of the number of borrowing transactions by survey respondents from june  through february  and the responses of these individuals to a four page questionnaire mailed to them in the summer of  street maps that originated with the us census tiger files were used to locate ie geocode library patrons home addresses the result is a series of points on a map that can be manipulated in various ways figure  is one example of how this type of data can be viewed each dot represents the home address of a survey respondent the color of the dot indicates the home branch of the respondent ie where that person obtained his or her library card the size of the dot indicates one of four ranges of circulation data the class breaks were set using relatively similar numbers of cases in each range among the many things that might be learned from viewing this map are  each branch seems to have at least a few people in the heaviest borrowing group  people registered at the main library live farther away than do other registrants  several people live great distances from their home branch a fact only apparent when the map is viewed in color it is also possible to calculate straight line distances between two points to test hypotheses about distance and borrowing at least one gis system permits the calculation of distances by tracing the route from point a to point b following the major roads rather than line ofsight geocoding can be a time confall
