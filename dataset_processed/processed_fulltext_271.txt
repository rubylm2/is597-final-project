 the library quarterly introduction the girl scouts an organization founded in  for young girls usually conjures up images of cookies uniforms and camping trips historical scholarship on the girl scouts often associates the members with upholding victorian gender norms bringing to mind notions of housekeeping and other traditionally female activities however closer scrutiny of the early girl scouts reveals a different picture an organization that was a composite of domestic instruction and independent motivation child care advice and career opportunities entertainment suggestions and lifesaving techniques the original girl scouts founded by southern reformer juliette low participated in activities that stressed accomplishment of personal goals and individual independence while maintaining strains of traditional feminine activity the literature produced by the early girl scouts between the years  and  provides important clues as to the kind of advice their leaders felt necessary to impart to these girls and the types of activities the organization promoted girl scout handbooks novels and periodical literature provide insight into the degree to which the girl scout organization promoted gender equality expected women spheres to be expanded outside the realm of children the home and morality and encouraged women to display their independence either surreptitiously or overtly the girl scouts evolved within a context of significant change for women social and public roles in the late nineteenth century southern women began to expand their spheres of influence through participation in women clubs and other organizations this activity usually began within a religious framework but quickly advanced into the social and eventually political realms the women christian temperance union wctu exemplifies this development from religion to politics as early as  southern women in the wctu under the guise of removing the sins that accompanied alcohol also asserted themselves as social reformers attempting to alleviate the social ills of the postbellum and increasingly urban south women literary clubs founded to promote intellectual growth soon followed the wctu and shortly thereafter southern women became active in the suffrage movement by the twentieth century southern women had carved out for themselves a public role within this atmospherejuliette gordon low began her organization for the youngest of women  for more on girl scout history before world war ii see the girl scout home page at wwwgsusaorg see also the attached bibliography for a listing of selected literature used to produce this article
american girlhood  the appearance of numerous women clubs and organizations at the turn of the century illustrated the relatively rapid development of the southern women movement some of these associations were southern specific such as the women campaign against lynching although others like the national american woman suffrage association were simply southern annexes of established northern organizations a few organizations were actually initiated in the south and eventually became national in scope and popularity the girl scouts of america was one such organization founded with sixteen members the organization spread rapidly throughout the south and the nation the life ofjuliette gordon low spans the half century evolution of the southern women movement low was born in  the same year the nation elected lincoln to his first term her life parallels the south emergence from an agrarian planter society to a modern region characterized by its industrial social and political activity low and the girl scouts mirror the development of the region women from relative isolation to a flourishing and socially proactive community juliette gordon low the early years ofjuliette gordon low the founder of the girl scouts are essentially a study in paradoxes a short sketch of her experiences before and during development of this movement illustrates the transition from traditional woman to new woman that many women underwent at the turn of the century although her family raised her within the strictest southern social traditions juliette low proceeded along a path that deviated far from what was expected of her martha saxton in a biographical account of the girl scout leader writes that low never felt prepared for anything not for the elegant savannah society into which she was born nor for the civil war that rocked her family not for her disastrous marriage and not for her volcanic mother  this vulnerability did not stem from neglect for low was educated in the best schools introduced to savannah society as a debutante and sent to europe to cultivate her cultural vocabulary the gordon family groomed their daughter to become the perfect southern lady while abroad she met and married english playboy william low his wandering tendencies his long hunting excursions and their inability to have children left low increasingly alienated from her husband in  william low died leaving most of his estate to his mistress who according to the will was to distribute an allowance to juliette every month low contested the will and eventually received her fair share of the inheritance  p 
 the library quarterly historian charles strickland suggests that following this personal crisis low felt aimless humiliated and without purpose  her disastrous and childless marriage left her without the emotional stability and security her wealthy southern upbringing had promised again this sense of uncertainty affected low personal consciousness and her understanding of where women belonged in society low had followed all of the rules yet her failed marriage and failed sense of contribution left her disillusioned she began to focus on her painting and sculpting and continued to travel through europe in  she met sir robert baden powell founder of the british youth movement the boy scouts powell visionary organization encouraged obedience discipline and development of character through outdoor militaryinspired activities helping others following a moral code displaying honesty and maintaining a cheerful disposition were central tenets of the boy scout movement  low was inspired by powell philosophy particularly its emphasis on protocol and self sufficiency consequently she decided to try it for herself and while spending a summer in a scottish glen lochs she formed a female youth group and encouraged the girls to learn british history knot tying livestock care and wool spinning low new ideas about women activities and responsibilities had already begun to develop instead of focusing exclusively on domestic expertise low advocated activities like wool spinning and livestock care in an effort to teach the girls self sufficiency skills she wanted to provide them with ways to support themselves selling wool or chickens that would keep the young women away from the urban factories and the terrible conditions inherent in the manufacturing industry  p  low personal crisis also led her to an understanding that to succeed women needed a set of survival skills although she was unwilling to renounce traditional femininity she was able through this early experience to identify ways in which women could develop independent strategies for self sufficiency juliette low realized although perhaps subconsciously that the adolescence of the american women movement demanded an organization like the girl scouts to help guide young women through the conflicts that confronted them in this new era girl scout literature while juliette low life experiences suggest some of the reasons why she founded the more progressive american version of this female youth movement the literature produced by the girl scouts indicates how the organization actually envisioned itself and the roles of women
american girlhood  at this time this literature supplies an invaluable tool to help us further understand the issues facing women in the early decades of the s as well as providing a true picture of how the girl scouts struggled to reconcile their traditional obligations with their progressive desires the girl scout literature provides important clues as to the kind of advice their leaders felt necessary to impart to these girls and the types of activities the organization promoted girl scout handbooks novels and periodical literature provide insight into the degree to which the girl scout organization promoted gender equality expected a woman sphere to be expanded outside the realm of children the home and morality and encouraged women to display their independence either surreptitiously or overtly although the girl scout movement initially focused only on middleclass white girls it very quickly diversified beginning in  with immigrant troops in the overcrowded metropolitan areas like new york and chicago the organization expanded further to include africanamerican girls as early as the s however the exclusively white regional councils did not officially recognize many of these groups until the late s   the girl scouts membership also included troops made up primarily of disabled girls and also native americans because most troops were organized according to neighborhood girls from different ethnic and economic backgrounds often remained separate from each other in the case of african americans however segregation was standard throughout the south until  when the girl scout policy officially changed to promote integration  race was debated frequently within the national offices from the organization inception according to elisabeth israels perry  p  however what is most significant is that young women from many groups african american middle class white disabled and immigrant all participated in a single organization that made no distinctions for the individual groups the tenets of physical fitness domestic activity philanthropy and community participation appealed and were available to all of these girls although not addressed in this article it is likely these ideals did not necessarily have the same inherent conflicts for other groups gender ideologies as they did with the traditional ideals for young white middle class women perry study of africanamerican tennessee girl scouts found that josephine holloway who began the first african american troop in nashville felt girl scouting to be the very best influence for girls  p  regardless of the  for information about african amefican scouts see  for immigrant scouting information see   for information about disabled scouting programs see  for native american troops see  and the gsusa home page at wwwgsusaorg
 the library quarterly intended socializing nature the inherent paradoxes or the difficulties of establishing minority troops the girl scout message appealed to girls and women from a variety of racial ethnic and economic backgrounds by  low had registered five thousand girls in more than one hundred cities for participation in her program any girl could become a girl scout she only had to promise to earn her dues to obey the girl scout laws to be obedient and help other people and to follow the girl scout promise to do duty to god and country to help other people at all times to obey the laws of the scouts the premise of the girl scouts was to encourage the development of character and leadership among young girls through activities considered fun and instructive leaders intended activities such as camping to inspire cooperation achievement and development of sound minds and bodies the final goal was to produce the qualities in young women that would make them wholesome productive citizens  pp   to initiate the development of the girl scouts low began by advertising her organization in newspapers and magazines and by training women who expressed interest in leadership positions at the top of low agenda was the production and distribution of a handbook the original girl scout handbook how girls can help their country the handbook for girl scouts published in  was the first piece of literature produced by the organization  modeled after and quite often a verbatim replication of the boy scouts version the handbook for boys the girl scout handbook illuminates the strategy goals and ideology of the girl scout movement additional periodical literature produced by the organization such as the rally first published in october  a magazine for scout leaders and american girl which evolved out of the rally as the members expressed a desire for a publication geared toward the youth also reveals girl scout ideas about gender roles the rally popularity is evident by its circulation  copies were distributed in its second year and by   people received the magazine the rally contained articles about scouting activities regular features such as a mailbox column and troop news and editorials from the national leaders in addition fiction and book reviews were added to the magazine format a few years after its founding  p   throughout this text evidence of girl scout principles and ideology are pulled from both the  and  editions of the girl scout handbooks i use these handbooks interchangeably as there is virtually no difference between them the  handbook is essentially an expanded and polished version of the  edition the handbook tone did change however between  and  see 
american girlhood  independent authors also published children novels based on the ideals of the girl scouts many of these novels though about girl scouts were neither approved nor regulated by the organization although these books are not official publications they do highlight the popular perceptions of and reactions to the girl scouts one such book a girl scout of red rose troop by amy blanchard was part of a series produced in the early s a sort of nancy drew of its time  p  the appearance and subsequent popularity of such literature a mere five years after the conception of the girl scouts speaks to the books representation of the organization ideals a significant portion of the girl scout literature focuses on traditional notions of femininity the  handbook reminds young women that girl scouts should do everything in their power to make and keep their homes healthy as well as happy  p  the second girl scout handbook published in  explains that girl scouts are required to do a good turn every day because this is the spirit that makes the older scout into a fine useful dependable woman who does so much good in her community that she becomes naturally one of its leading citizens on whom everyone relies  p  a large component of this model of citizenship includes housework for the handbook continues to direct her household has always been a woman job in every century   the girl of today has to learn about these things in a scientific businesslike way in order to get it all done with the quickest most efficient methods we no longer believe that housekeeping should take up all a woman time and many an older woman envies the little badges on a scout sleeve that show the world she has learned how to manage her cleaning and her cooking  p  as much as the literature stresses efficiency little question remains that housework was still considered one of the woman central responsibilities girl scout materials also addressed this wish to help others help themselves in the realm of housekeeping a motion picture produced by the girl scouts in  exemplifies the combination of housekeeping and helping others the black and white silent film depicts a girl scout troop helping a soldier family during world war i this section of the film entitled the scouts as little citizens depicts girl scouts cleaning the front yard tidying the kitchen making beds bathing children and scrubbing floors in the hope that the daughter of the poor  i feel confident including these nonofficial books in this study of girl scout literature because they follow closely girl scout policy and often adopt identical language to the handbooks when describing girl scout activities and defining the organization goals in addition many girl scout supported repositories hold extensive collections of these books which further indicates their adherence to girl scout ideals
 the library quarterly family can continue this work the girl scouts instruct her on the elements of housekeeping at the end of the segment the girl scouts declare housework is not so bad when you do it for your country  housework was not the only traditional activity stressed by the organization the rally continuously addressed concerns and suggested activities that encouraged conservative roles for girls the magazine contained a monthly highlight entitled our party page the first issue to feature this page provided the following explanation all girls like to give parties and certainly girl scouts are no exception we have therefore decided to give every month in the rally a number of party suggestions  the party page administered advice on developing guest lists issuing invitations preparing food and choosing entertainment the rally also regularly offered advice on domestic activities such as sewing cleaning and gardening from the previous examples the movement appears to have promoted a traditional ideology of female domesticity however a complete reading of the handbook renders a different impression in fact all of the girl scout literature produced before world war ii contains a significant amount of material that challenges the more conventional feminine doctrine espoused at the time the girl scout literature encouraged girls to be strong educated self reliant and goal oriented rather than timid meek subservient and helpless female independence was expressed not only in the emphasis on efficiency in the housekeeping sections but also in a more deliberate manner throughout the literature one of the most persistent themes within the girl scout handbook is the notion of self sufficiency girl scouts were taught not only to help others become self sufficient but also were fully encouraged to do the same for themselves because traditional views of women particularly in the south implied that dependent or weak women were more desirable the girl scout emphasis on female self sufficiency appears particularly progressive the girl scout dues epitomize the attitude of self reliance promoted by the organization girls were expected to earn their own dues and to learn to manage money one of the laws of the girl scouts reads money is a very useful thing to have and the girl scout decides how much she can afford to save and does it so as to have it in an emergency a girl scout saves as she spends on some system did you ever stop to think that no matter how much money a man may earn the women of the family generally have the spending of most of it  p  helen and carol the two main characters in the scouting story a girl scout of red rose troop discuss the earning of their dues in an early
american girlhood  passage carol tells helen i delivered groceries for mr donovan he was short of errand boys    so i just ups and asks him if i couldn take the rush orders he gave me a quarter so i was five cents over and above the amount i needed  p  the original girl scout handbook further instructs girls that some of you are certain to become rich and some of you may die of poverty and misery and it just depends on your own selves which you are going to do  the girl who begins making money young will go on making it as a woman as a first class scout you have to have a certain amount in the savings bank before you can become entitled to wear a badge  pp  the girl scouts taught girls the practicalities involved in saving money and supporting themselves reminding them that by saving up  it enables you to keep yourself and not be a burden to others  p  part of providing for oneself included cultivation of the body through physical activities that further empowered girls by giving them a sense of a strong physical ability the scribe corner home scout news a section of the american girl relays troop activities to the magazine subscribers a troop from stonington connecticut reports during the summer of  we went on several hikes to the woods where we made fires and cooked our supper we also took several trips to fisher island where the us coast guard entertained us by giving an exhibition of their life saving drill afterwards we went swimming with some of the crew who demonstrated various strokes the girls have had instruction in rifle shooting and very helpful and interesting talks on first aid  in an article entitled physical education and the girl scout movement members of the girl scout organization and physical education experts alike applaud the physical components of the movement comments from leaders include hiking seems to me the most important physical part of scout work and camping seems to me the best physical feature of our work because it includes within itself many desirable forms of exercise and affords opportunity for wide and varied activities in this same article mary e gross the assistant director of physical education in cincinnati public schools wrote that the aims of the girl scout movement coincide with the best aims of modern physical education the girl scout organization aims to give the girl an opportunity to do the things that the girl naturally wishes to do  this understanding of physical fitness within the girl scout movement attributes a natural desire for outdoor exercise to young girls an innovative idea for its time  along the same lines of physical fitness and endurance the handbooks also encouraged activities specifically to develop strength such as skipping rowing fencing swimming tennis and handball 
 the library quarterly p  the  handbook includes an athlete proficiency test that required the scouts to be able to both play and coach ice hockey basketball and dodgeball  p  girl scout literature also encouraged girls to understand their own bodies in hopes that the girls would develop a daily physical routine the first handbook enumerates the daily exercises advising for example that girls make the heart strong in order to pump the blood properly to every part of the body and so to build up flesh bone and muscle exercise wimming and wrist pushing  p  the effort made to explain physiology not only contributes to physical health but also allows these girls to develop a sense of autonomy and control over their own bodies stemming naturally from its promotion of self sufficiency the organization advocated professional careers for women both the activities the girl scouts fostered and the actual career section of the handbook encouraged women to enter the work force the girl scouts were exposed to a multitude of skills that provided a solid foundation for whatever line of work they chose be it domestic or more public in nature the girl scout handbook did not merely imply that self sufficiency for women is important for it explicitly teaches if you ever had to earn your own livelihood there are many ways you could get it provided that your head is screwed on the right way  p  the career section shortly following this advice instructs young girls that to pursue careers previously inaccessible to women is admirable the section begins really well educated women can make a good income by taking up translating dispensing to be a doctor or in a hospital as stock brokers house decorators or agents managers of laundries accountants architects in the new libraries at deptford girls will now take the place of boys as assistants in russia the municipal fire brigade has been commanded by a young lady mlle yermoloff  p  this encouragement of women outside of normal realms and into professions such as doctor or fire chief indicates again the progressive nature of the american scouting philosophy the girl scout organization focus on self sufficiency and survival also manifested itself in the program emphasis on the development of research skills the requirements for almost every badge included some type of outside reading and research for example in order to pass the citizenship test the girls were expected to thoroughly research the laws of the united states even the athlete badge required a compilation of rules for sporting events the girl scout organization also promoted a strong familiarity with books the scribe proficiency badge was symbolized by an open book to complete the scribe badge girls were encouraged to read and expected to understand the different literary forms they studied drama novels and short fiction
american girlhood  and even memorized poems and biographical information about their authors  p  individual girl scout troops often participated in philanthropy at local libraries cataloging and reshelving the books this familiarity with research resources provided young girls with a means to answer their questions about the world and consequently encouraged the development of their intellect the organization itself provided women with many opportunities to hone their business skills the founding of the girl scouts national headquarters in  officially rendered the organization a business women participated in various promotional activities including advertising registering new troops submitting applications for patents fundraising and conference planning edith duncan johnston writes of her experience as the first national secretary she was responsible for press releases and publicity as well as for keeping the books and inventory she also forged relationships between the girl scouts and various other women groups such as the red cross and jane adams hull house  the girl scouts was more than a social club it employed a number of full time employees established an organizational protocol and arranged conventions in attempts to maintain continuity and to foster creative developments  pp   the troop organization also urged girls to explore leadership positions and fostered the development of qualities that would later allow girls to become good leaders the  handbook describes the organization of the girl scouts in the following way the ideal unit and the keystone of the organization is the patrol consisting of eight girls  they are a self selected and under the regulations and customs of the organization a selfgoverning little body who learn through practical experiment how to translate into democratic team play their recreation patriotic or community work camp life and athletics from one to four of these patrols constitutes a troop the administrative unit of the organization girl scouts are registered and chartered by troops and the troop meeting is their official gathering the troop has the privilege of owning a flag and choosing  its own personal crest and title  pp   girls were given the opportunity to run their own troops and many girls eventually joined the national staff of the girl scouts or contributed in other administrative capacities most girl scout leaders were once members of troops and many women found networks within these troops for collaboration on outside projects during the  publicity campaign the rally encouraged captains to get together with other captains and undertake community exposure efforts  the girl scout organization in its pursuit to develop young women potential also advocated the higher education of its members and leaders breaking from traditional philosophies that discouraged education
 the library quarterly for women the girl scouts not only promoted higher education but insisted its leaders obtain certain skills before assuming their positions the original handbook held up women such as marie curie and elizabeth garrett anderson described as a very clever lady doctor as models for girls who persevered in their studies according to the handbook when studying for the medical profession which no woman had then attempted to do she anderson had to go to france her great success and her zeal in starting the hospital for women in which all the doctors are women has been a benefit to hundreds of women and    a great encouragement to all girls  p  girl scout leaders were also offered opportunities for graduate study such as a boy scout work adaptation program at the university of wisconsin  additionally the rally reported in  still another great university has opened its doors to graduate study in scouting for girls the scholarship referred to in this notice consisted of a fivehundred dollar fellowship to be awarded for graduate study in social sciences at new york university  the girl scout organization further demonstrated its progressive nature by fostering meaningful friendships among girls rather than encouraging flirtation with boys traditional middle class socialization for young women in the victorian period included instruction in the art of coquettish flirtation culminating when women caught a man the girl scouts gave young women the opportunity to form relationships with other women providing them with space in which they could develop identities strengthen self esteem and stimulate intellectual growth the girl scouts created a constructive environment perfect for cultivating female bonds in a girl scout of red rose troop the scout patrol leader carol and her colonel helen experienced a friendship representative of this female bond shunning traditional flirtation with men carol informs her mother  like boys real nice boys but i don want to be foolish and that giggly whisper kind of foolish   p  she preferred instead her friendship with helen with whom she shares interests in gardening hiking and leading their girl scout troop carol helen and the girls in their troop work together as they encounter adventures for example saving a woman stranded in the woods with a broken leg and moral dilemmas for example confronting a fellow scout who stole from her troop because her family did not have enough money for food for carol and the young women reading this novel this sense of dedication to the troop and to her girl scout promise endorses the importance of friendship  elizabeth garrett anderson was the first british woman physician she was entered into the english medical register in 
american girlhood  in addition to fictional accounts emphasis on female friendship also can be found in the girl scout handbook one of the girl scout laws a girl scout is a friend to all and a sister to every other girl scout advises young women that women are said to be inclined to cliques and snobbishness and the world looks to great organizations like the girl scouts to break down their petty barriers of race and class and make our sex a great power for democracy in the days to come  pp   the girl scouts gave these young women a space in which they could operate with a moral code and could foster through shared experience a self identity founded on accountability and a sense of importance conclusion the girl scout organization intended to be more than a social club for girls their literature suggests a variety of activities aimed at preparing them both for domestic activities and more progressive roles as women began to participate in the public realm juliette low scouts prepared for a similar future the printed materials produced by the organization consistently emphasize physical strength professional careers healthy living and efficient housekeeping taken in its entirety the literature indicates that the leaders and the participants aspired to be more than mere representatives of the myth of true womanhood many of america new women began their path toward social activity and political participation under the guiding influence of the girl scouts of america these young women desired a forum in which they could express their independence take part in outdoor activities and provide help to others although the organization never explicitly asserted the equality of the sexes and continued to maintain certain conservative ideas the girl scouts did advance women place in the public arena and their right to lead strong independent lives through the girl scouts and its female centered environment young women developed sound minds strong bodies and a social consciousness that extended far beyond the traditional domain appendix additional listing of girl scout literature produced before world war ii brown p h the one and only band st nicholas  november
