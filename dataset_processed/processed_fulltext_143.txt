an approach to fiction through the characteristics of its readers jeannette howard foster probably the best introduction to the following study is an account of how it came to be made during the year i  there were in progress in the graduate library school of the university of chicago five different projects devoted to reading the reading done by some twenty thousand persons in and outside of libraries since each was concerned with the nature of material read some classification of printed matter was necessary for non fiction the accepted library schemes were available but as no public librarian will be surprised to learn o  per cent of all reading was done in fiction and thus distinctions in that field became imperative because the distinctions needed were qualitative and few in number the problem might at a glance appear simple librariians and other workers with literature possess a seasoned judgment adequate to the day demands indeed set a group down with the average run of best sellers and coincidence of opinion is likely to suggest no need of further criteria for literary quality but require the same persons to formulate the principles underlying their judgments so that unpracticed assistants can apply them or with a few qualitative categories adopted give the group a score of borderline titles to vote up or down without qualification the result will surprise anyone who has not tried the game the reasons are simple enough no generally accepted objeci a north central association survey to be published by the university of chicago press b leon carnovsky community stedies in reading ii hinsdale a suburb of chicago library quarterly v january i pp i o c louis round wilson and edward a wight county library service in the south a study of the rosenwald county library demonstration chicago university of chicago press i d lee wachtel study of du page county illinois unpublished e south chicago study unpublished 
an approach to fiction through its readers i tive criteria exist for excellence in fiction critical and aesthetic value theory is highly abstract and as diverse as the personal philosophies of its authors it also rests fundamentally on the conception of literature as an art whereas the great mass of popular fiction is written and readfor reasons other than its literary value and receives comparatively little serious critical attention in addition the inferior novel itself neither intellectual nor impersonal in tone seems especially prone to rouse personal reactions to its subject matter a factor which modern psychology recognizes as more cogent in affecting literary judgment even than matthew arnold thought when he voiced his familiar warning against it as evidence that the problem is not simple each of the five studies mentioned above undertaken independently developed a different system of classification for its fiction ranging from the twofold division of the north central survey to two quite dissimilar five category schemes employed by the rosenwald and the south chicago studies respectively from an abstract viewpoint all five were equally sound to be sure something of their variety was due to difference of purpose but mainly it resulted from fundamental differences in the bases of division on which the schemes were built thus any comparison of results was all but impossibly complex and as the integration of reading studies is indispensable to successful cultivation of the field the problem of unification assumed large importance the search for well defined criteria of quality had been pursued to exhaustion in working out these five systems critical theory specific book reviews library catalogs and other printed lists of good novels had all been tried and found helpful but finally indecisive the only recourse seemed approach from a new and more objective angle the nature of readers who choose given types of fiction treatment of reading data in all five studies showed that groups of people similar in sex age occupation etc tended toward similarity in general reading habits just as waples and tyler what people want to read about had  douglas waples and r w tyler whapeopk want to read about chicago american library association and university of chicago press ii chap iv
 the library quarterly indicated earlier with respect to reading interests thus it seemed likely that further analysis of fiction according to the nature of groups reading it might shed light upon the difficulty as has been said a large number of reading records had been collected the groups for which records were easily available for use in the present study are given in table i all data were collected between november i  and january  table i reader groups providing data for present study group number of readers residents of south chicago an industrial community of fairly low economic status and social organization   patrons of three branches of the chicago public library most from a residence hotel and apartment neighborhood distinctly superior to south chicago   residents of evanston and winnetka wealthy suburban neighborhoods   students in the upper three years of bowen high school in south chicago and of evanston high school   i atrons of the public library of hinsdale illinois a prosperous suburban town of  in the metropolitan area of chicago xo residents of morris county new jersey comprising both rural and town population no point in the county is strictly suburban to new york though much of it lies in the metropolitan area   total  i though this sample of readers conspicuously urban and centered about chicago cannot pretend to represent american readers as a whole it was considered sufficiently large and diverse to offer valuable material for study this judgment was interestingly supported by discovery later that the authors most read by these readers were also most read by canadian farmers in the fraser valley british columbia by farm women in the mississippi valley and by college students reporting from all unpublished data on community reading filed in the graduate library school of the university of chicago  lucille reynolds leisure time activities of a selected group of farm women unpublished dissertation department of home economics university of chicago 
an approch to fiction through its readers  parts of the united statess the personal characteristics of these readers were accordingly analyzed in relation to the fiction they had read the intention was to choose units of fiction for study which would adequately represent the whole field and would at the same time be read by groups large enough for statistical treatment the immediate problem became the definition of such units ideally single titles might seem desirable most novels however are sufficiently individual so that few principles could be safely induced from the study of any one of them whatever care were exercised in selecting typical examples moreover it appeared unlikely from a practical standpoint that groups of statistically reliable size would have read just those books which would serve as types thus the use of subject classes seemed more plausible large categories such as mystery adventure and romance however include such a variety as to defeat one of the main ends of the study the clarifying of qualitative distinctions and to the choice of smaller subject divisions almost insurmountable obstacles arose briefly examination of subject indexes of fiction in the various library catalogs showed that possible categories range from objective units of locality or occupation to very general aspects of psychological approach it also showed that frequently the same novel is indexed under two three or even four different small headings for the normal tale is not a single minded affair but touches on several phases of human interest hence setting up mutually exclusive categories on a small subject basis was hopeless practically then the only unit remaining was the single author that this choice is not ideal can easily be demonstrated by pointing to any single author whose work is diverse in both subject and quality a careful consideration of such internal differences however reveals rather less contrast in quality than one at first believes and seldom as great difference in subject matter as that between one author and another there was s letter from professor atwood townsend of new york university to professor douglas waples of the graduate library school may i
x the library quarterly moreover support for the choice in the success of a study already made of readers in new york public libraries in which consideration of a few highly popular authors of fiction and their readers had revealed consistent group interests accordingly authors were chosen as units for study since the obvious basis for selection of authors was the num ber of their readers it became necessary to decide what number should be required as a minimum statistical authorities consider forty cases as few as can be expected to yield good results in experimental work but this dictum applies to random samples whereas groups defined by common reading of an author were often fairly homogeneous as the reliability of group averages depends upon group range in the factors under consideration homogeneous groups much smaller than forty may show statistical constants with extremely low probable error notwithstanding the thousands of readers on record the adoption of forty as a minimum group would have reduced qualifying authors to about eighty in number with noticeable concentration in the fields of mystery western tales and happyending romance as is evident from figure i the number of qualifying authors increases almost geometrically as the size of the reader group is reduced variety in quality and subject matter also increases it was therefore desirable to set the group minimum as low as possible since there were many factors under consideration age education occupation amount and quality of reading etc it was evident that variations similar in direction however slight would reinforce one another and gain statistical significance after some computation therefore ten readers was set as a minimum though it was recognized that for groups of less than fifteen findings must be more suggestive than final and markedly heterogeneous small groups were disregarded the applica douglas waples and r w tyler unpublished study of reading in five branches of the new york public library  k j holzinger statistical methodsfor students in education boston ginn c i  p i the probability of significance increases as the square of the number of factors varying in the same direction

 the library quarterly treatment of data with authors chosen for study all readers of each were listed and their characteristics as a group studied information was available concerning their age sex education occupation reading done during a given two weeks and source of material read in order to facilitate comparisons between authors the data were treated mathematically wherever possible for each author group ie readers of a given author the following values were computed mean age and interquartile range of age mean education and range percentage of male readers percentage of readers in each of seven occupational classes professional and executive shop keepers and salesmen clerks and stenographers skilled trades unskilled labor students and housewives mean number of books read in two weeks percentage of reading which was a non fiction b good fiction c inferior fiction and d juvenile or near juvenile fiction and percentage of fiction by our selected authors obtained elsewhere than from the public library the  author groups were then ranked according to their standing on each of the points above and mean median and quartiles figured for each of these distributions finally a contingency chart was constructed to show how many times each author in the selected list waa read with each other author these actual frequencies of coincidence were then compared with the expected or chance frequencies a function of the number of readers of both authors involved and significant pairs were noted it will be interesting to stop at this point for a glance at the  classification used in unpublished new york public library study before cited although these classes cannot be assigned numerical values the first five may be considered as in descending rank with regard to prerequisite training and financial returns il for complete distributions see j h foster an experiment in classifying fiction based on the characteristics of its readers unpublished dissertation graduate library school university of chicago  i those pairs were noted as significant in which the works of one author were read by readers of the other five or more times if this number constituted more than the expected frequency these limitations were necessary because the statistically expected number was less than unity for pairs involving little read authors and thus the necessarily whole number of actual coincidence even if only one became significant

 the librdry quarterly readers relation to author read any discussion of writers in terms of their readers assumes that individual differences in reading depend more upon the readers personal characteristics than on other factors an assumption which needs close scrutiny other influences which indubitably affect choice of reading are availability and external pressure of availability no accurate measure was possible in the present study that prolific authors have in general more readers than others is evident from the correspondence between number of readers per author and number of titles by that author actually read the latter being the only measure at hand of titles available but the most prolific writers produce novels at their present rate because they are sure of sales and these are a reflection of readers choice thus number of titles per author becomes a progression indissolubly bound up with readers tastes titles actually read and volumes potentially available however are not the same even though estimates of the latter must be very inaccurate they are necessary in accordance with the chicago public library present policy of reducing holdings in inferior fiction worn copies of many authors in the lower quality levels are not replaced and inspection of both shelf list and shelves in early i showed more volumes of mcfee may sinclair sackville west peterkin anatole france hemingway rose macaulay and atherton all in the lowest quarter of our list with respect to number of readers than of edgar wallace carolyn wells pedler g l hill curwood fletcher raine rohmer or seltzer from our most read quarter public library policy may be slightly less exacting elsewhere but it is known to be more so at least in evanston and winnetka it is probably safe to say that library availability bears little relation to the proportion of readers for writers in the lower levels of quality on availability from sources other than the public library there was even less check an estimate of the stock of bookstores and rental libraries in each local community even if possible would have been an unjustified effort for only about  u correlation of o

an approach to fiction through its readers  reading these two values were compared to quality range of age showed a positive relation persons capable of appreciating the best are found in all age levels while inferior material attracts more homogeneous groups because of its more personal appeal students are always concentrated within a fairly narrow age range of course but the more advanced who read fiction of the highest quality show more variety in age than do those in lower educational levels therefore though the percentage of student readers in level  was high they were of a maturity and diversity not to vitiate the range relationship range of education does not appear from table v to have much bearing on quality but upon inspection of the total distributionl the reason was seen to lie in a double and compensating relation authors of the highest quality appear at both ends of the education range list but not in the middle that is the authors in levels  and  are divided into those whose readers vary widely in education and those whose student readers make their range narrow thus it is just as with age voluntary readers of the best appreciate it regardless of amount of education but student concentration naturally shows more sharply here than in the age distribution occupational variations with respect to quality were interestingly irregular since no author groups were removed from these averages the large number of students in the highest level reduced the percentage of other occupations in that group no occupational count increased regularly with quality but by comparing the six groups divided into halves or thirds definite tendencies could be detected readers of the professional rank showed the sharpest increase with quality for the years of training required would give the professions weight in any scale where age and education were significant the shop owning and salesman class showed the same tendency though with less marked increase in the upper two levels both skilled trades and unskilled labor showed larger percentages of readers in the lower than in the higher levels with a see foster op cit appendix vi

an approach to fiction through its readers i class with class relations one fact which emerges from all these class comparisons is that certain of the classes behave more like discrete units than others some that is show fairly consistent variations in all factors along with basic differences from other classes which seem explicable others show basic resemblances to each other and differences either inexplicable or due to pressure reading which confuses rather than clarifies class distinctions these latter either are real classes differing in ways which can be detected only by finer and more subjective tests than those at our command or they are not real units efforts were made to discover which was the case since there was not as with the quality groups any consecutive logical order for subject classes on the basis of the factors studied no test by gradations of value was possible the only check upon their soundness was the relative frequency with which classes were read together it seemed reasonable to suppose that if a subject class is distinctive and has high interest value for a given group of readers they will read more in it than outside it therefore if the class is read more often with itself than with others its chances of integrity are excellent accordingly the expected frequency of reader coincidence was figured from the contingency chart mentioned earlier for all paired combinations of the fifteen classes the actual frequency divided by this number and the pairs rated by the resultss there were possible of course but fifteen combinations of class with same class and o combinations between different classes fourteen of the fifteen same class pairs fell within the forty five most frequent of these i combinations an indication that on the whole the groups were sound the average ratio of actual to expected frequency for same class pairs was  for different class pairs i certain of the group relations need comment the familychronicle class may be read oftenest with itself because these stories come out ordinarily in two or three volumes so that to s see foster op cit table viii p i i for the distribution of class pairs
 the library quarterly read more than one of them in a fortnight is not a true case of either author or class repetition thus this class probably ought to stand at about half its present frequency value that romance should stand as low as thirteenth among the same group pairs was also surprising for from an abstract viewpoint this seemed one of the most distinctive divisions it was read most often with historical novels however and next most frequently with adventure now the essential distinction between romance and adventure as the two were here conceived is merely a more exotic setting and a greater emotionalism for romance thus the latter is read by both men and women especially girls too young to be interested in more real emotional situations and hence the concomitant reading pattern of romance readers will be diverse moreoverit is possible that certain of the more emotional adventure writers really belong in romance though they were classified in the former because of their realistic western settings undoubtedly the reason for zane grey outranking any other writer is his combination of robust physical violence with a heavy charge of romantic sentiment it cannot be called real emotion which gives him an appeal to both masculine and feminine readers it is still believed however that costume romance is a class distinct from other adventure humor also all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding it ranks ii in the list of i pairs is abstractly a distinct subject thus it became evident that there is a difference between even the most clear cut logical class and one which attracts consistent reader groups the latter sort was the object of our present search as the group combinations were further examined it appeared that with the exception of family chronicles the sameclass pairs read oftenest together were all among those classes with low quality value while the better classes from a literary standpoint were read less often with themselves than with other similar groups of high quality for example novels in the character study class were read with psychological novels with family chronicles with philosophical problem novels and with spe

i the library quarterly subject classes would need more general recasting i the more objective authors as those who write of special groups of people or special settings would be incorporated with the more external observers of character certain of the family chronicle writers would fall here also notably undset  social political and economic problems would be widened to include all writers whose work suggests propaganda of any sort  another class possibly to be called philosophical would hold those writers with a special theme or interpretation of life including those now in the upper levels of philosophical problems and such others as eliot g z stone and the satirists implying criticism of society france clemens  a last psychological class would include those writers dealing with subjective analysis of character thus subject classes would be reduced to a total of ten increasing the likelihood that distinctions would not be too delicate for measurement by such personal characteristics of readers as library records now include nothing can indicate more clearly than the preceding paragraph that the present study is a begiinning rather than a final word the whole of it will tell practicing librarians little about either fiction or their clients reading behavior of which they were not already instinctively certain it is offered merely with two hopes that it may suggest a possible method of entering objectively that field of literary opinion which has for so long supported the philosophic conflict of literary tastes and that it may lead to further discoveries as to why people read what they do for the choice of reading in subject classes particularly lies near to that problem so fascinating and so blind to all who teach literature or purvey books the present effort looks toward a time when it will be possible to say tell me what you read and i will tell you what you are
