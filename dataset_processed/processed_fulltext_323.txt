the occupations of registered borrowers in a public library walter h kaiser registration figure which represents borrowers registered for a  consistent and definite time period is a rough but useful indicator of the library acceptance by the public the figure becomes more useful as it is analyzed into specific and significant terms age education occupation sex race etc the effects of these factors on reading and library use have been recorded in other publications this segmental report of registration is concerned with ascertaining the occupations of one public library borrowers and with relating the occupational groups found in the library registration to those in the total population the community in which this study was made is muncie indiana a city which was the subject of the lynds two noteworthy volumes middletown and middletown in transition these two volumes afford ample information for those who might wish to explore the community backgrounds of the public library during the period january iijune  the occupations of  adult borrowers of the muncie public library were tabulated under the major occupation groups used by the bureau of the census these groups are inclusive but are sufficiently specific to reveal useful information note on method in the compilation of the tables several adjustments of the registration data were made to allow comparisons with the  census data thus it was necessary to enlarge each occupational grouping of registered borrowers to the figure representing their true or approximate number in the total registration the registration period for the library is three years but the study was carried on for only eighteen months during this period  per cent of the total adult registration and  per cent of the total juvenile registration were recorded these two groups were enlarged so that both reflected ioo per cent of the actual registration another correction factor was employed in arriving at the total number of persons in each occupational group in the population served by the library since occupational data except for the enumeration of farmers were available for the city of muncie only while the library serves both muncie and the township in which muncie is located approximately  per cent of the population of the township resides outside the city limits the population figure for farmers was deduced from census data and the remaining groups were each enlarged to reflect the population of the township the writer personal observation of the occupational character of the population residing in the township outside muncie permits this adjustment with a minimum of error the i all the census data used in this study and included in the tables appear in us bureau of the census rth census of ilke united states rgo population second series characteristics of the population indiana washington government printing office  tables    and  i i
i the library quarterly map in the lynds middletoun in transition is cited in confirmation in tabulating the registration data persons fourteen years and over were assumed to hold adult cards since the library grants adult cards to those boys and girls who have completed eight grades the registration and the census data as used in this study which relate to the occupation not reported group require explanation for this group the library registration figure includes those who in the census data are reported as unable to work or seeking work and probably a small percentage of persons for whom the information could not be obtained to this group were related the census data for those on public work seeking work unable to work in institutions and other and occupation not reported some degree of error is probably existent for each group because of this rationalization of the data but the error is not likely to be important the following occupational groups were considered as one group in compiling the registration figure for the service workers domestic service workers service workers except domestic and protective service workers farm laborers there were only thirty in the census data were not tabulated as such but were included as laborers comments and conclusions the following high lights of the report and related comments are noted briefly for the convenience of the reader some of these proceed directly from only one statistical table others from several tables and still others are the writer own interpretations and opinions i the largest single group which is registered by the library is the juvenile group aged five to thirteen which accounts for  per cent of the total library registration housewives with i per cent and students with  per cent follow in order after these three table  comparison of adult library registration and adult population by occupational groups no percentpercentpercentregino inage of age of age of occupational regirsnop grou total total group teredpotiugroup adult adult by llaion egia popuregisbrary tered lation tration housewives  ii    students        clerical   i i   i craftsmen   i    ii occupation not reported    i  professional   i    services    i   proprietors    i   laborers   i i   operatives       farmers     i i total  i   ioi  table  ranking of adult occupational groups by library registration by size and by percentage of registration rank occupational gutoup bynby perg nistored by size centage registered registered housewives i i  students    clerical    craftsmen    occupation not reported   io professional    services    proprietors    laborers  io  operatives i  i i farmers i i i i

 the library quarterly chase of books and magazines the rental of books and the allocation of its time for business social and community activities will tend to keep the percentage of registration down fortunately this group contains some of the strongest supporters that the library has in the community in spite of the fact that they are not registered borrowers of the library this group too has among its members some who are the most effective in opposition to the library request for appropriations this opposition does not always proceed from a stinginess with public funds but often from lack of information as to what the library is doing in the community thus it is important that the nonlibrary users of this group be given a picture of the place of the library in the community through board members the librarian the staff and other mediums o if the juvenile and students groups are considered together as students this combination of similar groups accountsfor  per cent of all library registration if housewives are added to this grouping we find that  per cent of the total library registration is made up of students and housewives and this figure does not include the women to be found in the professional clerical services and other groups the population data reveal that women in the whole population including housewives children in the age group one to thirteen years and the students group a group considered children by many comprise about s per cent of the total population one occasionally hears the comment that the public library serves mostly women and children a comment which usually is given as a veiled criticism but the population data indicate that it could not be otherwise io the census data throw some light on the library registration potential there are several groups in the community which offer little if any possibility of being registered one group the largest which has no representation in the registration figure is made up of table  employment status persons fourteen years and over muncie male female in labor force  i   per cent of popidation fourteen years and over     employed except in public emergency work      wage and salary workers  i i   employers and own account workers   i   unpaid family workers     class of worker not reported    on public emergency work wpa nya     seeking work                       experienced workers  i    n ew w orkers  i  not in labor force      i engaged in own home housework   i  in school    u nable to w ork    in institutions     other and not reported   i

i  the library quarterly and who will not reregister h those who read library books but who read books borrowed on other persons cards the factors affecting registration are easy to list but isolating and identifying the factor or factors and in the correct degree for each group or individual in a large community seem an impossible task the factors are such that a weak library in one community can register a higher percentage of its population than a strong library in another community the registration period for both being the same an experiment to ascertain to what extent the library itself determines the registration potential could be made by selecting a group which ranks low in registration and applying all possible methods to raise the registration figure such an experiment would be the most important justification for the registration study laying the groundwork for the broadening and intensification of library service one condition which may prevent registration from rising far beyond the generally accepted standards in the near future is the presence in the adult poputable  composition of the population years of school completed muncie male female total twenty five years old and over  i   no school years completed   ig i  grade school i  years   i     or  years  i    or  years    ioio high school i  years   x  i  years     oi college i  years  i     years or more      not reported  i  i median school years completed     table  composition of the population age and sex center township age male female total under five      five to fourteen      fifteen to twenty four      twenty five to thirty four    i thirty five to forty four     o i forty five to fifty four      o  i fifty five to sixty four   i   sixty five and over  i  i total     i twenty one and over center township  i o i oo  seventy five and over muncie      seventy to seventy four muncie      under one muncie     
the occupations of library borrowers i lation of persons who do not read books because available books are not geared to their reading ability miss tompkins has estimated this group to comprise  per cent of the adult population if this is true then nearly one third of the total population would be found in such a group in muncie such a condition may not exist in muncie to the extent of miss tompkins i estimate but that it does exist in some degree is clear the library itself has undoubtedly decreased the number of potential registrants through its policy with respect to fines the exact number of inactive cards on file because of fines is not known but they do exist and it is reasonable to expect that as these cards expire many will not be renewed over a period of years unless the fines are remitted the number of such blocked persons will be considerable that this is a problem in many libraries is made clear by the many articles on the subject in professional journals a few libraries have even discontinued charging fines to children the writer believes although the matter has not gone further than thought in this library that fines incurred for overdue books but not for damaged or lost books may well be automatically canceled when the per capita income of the library equals the amount of the fine the credit being allowed say either semiannually or annually there should be a statute of limitations on fines especially in the case of fines for overdue books it hardly seems equitable for the library to impose a permanent penalty permanent in the sense that a fine does amount to this for some persons for a temporary inconvenience to the community particularly since such persons must continue to pay taxes for the library services which are denied them such a method of remitting fines as here suggested would have in its favor the strong points of being definite reasonable and useful as a yardstick to recapitulate two facts of the registration report stand out the library does a good job in registering students both juvenile and adult securing about three fourths of that group but falls down in registering adults of whom it secures only about one fourth of the adult groups the professional a group which has long been accustomed to using books for both professional and personal reasons shows the highest percentage of registration but still only  per cent of their group is registered it is therefore among the adult groups which excluding students constitute about  per cent of the population that the library will have to find new borrowers if the level of registration is to be noticeably raised methods of accomplishing this end are still in the speculative stage but a knowledge of the facts as contained in the registration report is a useful first step in the process miriam d tompkins what is a readable book booklist xxx i ig  away with children fines wilson library bulletin xiv i
