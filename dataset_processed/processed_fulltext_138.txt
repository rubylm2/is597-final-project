 the library quarterly visions of madison will regarding the library were not carried out by his widow and possession of the books by the university of virginia was secured only through a lawsuit settled after mrs madison death although madison did not show the genius and versatility that characterized jefferson he was a man of great talent and literary ability his love of books is reflected in their frequent mention in his letters and by the large library which he collected information concerning the literary interests of the next president of the united states who came from virginia is greatly limited james monroe was born in westmoreland county virginia in  after completing his preparatory schooling monroe entered william and mary college in  and remained there until he entered the continental army in  he remained in the service until  and had been advanced to the rank of lieutenant colonel when discharged he had been recommended by washington and lord stirling for further service but the exhausted finances of the country made the raising of a new regiment impossible monroe was compelled to retire from the service because of the lack of a command he was greatly disappointed and retired to his home where he spent some time seeking solace in books monroe soon entered public life and in  was sent as a member of the continental congress from virginia during much of his life he was financially handicapped an evidence of this was recorded in  when he wrote to jefferson in france thanking him for sending the encyclopedia and promising to send the money soon although he did not have the amount at that time the same year monroe received a copy of jefferson notes on virginia together with news of a balloon ascension and disaster in france in  jefferson had not been reimbursed for the encyclopedia as monroe expressed regret that he had not yet been able to tender payment a few years later monroe was in a position to reciprocate the favors of jefferson and other virginia friends he was commissioned minister to france in  and two years later wrote to james madison from paris i wish you to send me a list of what other things you want  especially of books  i will provide  send or bring them with me when i return home soon afterward a similar offer was made to jefferson who had desired additional volumes of the encyclopedia monroe official conduct in france did not meet with the approval of the federalist party and he was recalled he felt that his recall was not justified and upon his return wrote a book reviewing the whole affair it bore the lengthy title a view of the conduct of the executive in the foreign affairs of the united states the subject matter aroused much antagonism among the federalists while the jeffersonian party praised it highly many copies were sold and the work was later republished in london after the election of jefferson the question of an outlet of the mouth of the mississippi river became serious and  lester j cappon archivist of the university of virginia april   to the author  daniel c gilman james monroe new york houghton mifflin co  pp xi    s m hamilton ed the writings of james monroe new york g p putnam sons  i   randolph alemoirs correspondence and private papers of thomas jefjerson i     the writings of james amonroe    ibid ii  ii ibid iii    ibid iii
