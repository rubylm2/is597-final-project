a conceptual model of factors influencing the outcome of challenges to library materials in secondary school settings dianne mcafee hopkins this study addresses the research question what are the variables that influence the outcome of challenges to school library materials at the secondary level a conceptual model is provided that describes the outcome of challenges to materials in terms of retention restriction and removal the model was derived from research findings in library and information science educational administration behavioral science and communications and suggests that the path from the challenge to the outcome is complex the model contains several classes of variables including district materials selection policy school environment community environment and initiator of challenge variable classes of special interest in the present study are the characteristics of the librarian which emphasize the psychological factors of locus of control and dogmatism and complaint background which focuses on whether the complaint was oral or written and whether there was active support for the retention or the removal of materials the validity of the model was tested using survey research methods with a national sample of school librarians reporting challenges to materials the results were found generally to support the model introduction definitions and conceptual framework the question of access to information for children and young adults particularly from the standpoint of intellectual freedom is one of broad and sustained interest in spite of this interest there has been surprisingly little systematic research that has moved the profession forward  the primary funding for this study was provided by the us department of education office of educational research and improvement library programs additional support was provided by encyclopaedia britannica inc the institute on race and ethnicity university of wisconsin system and the graduate school university of wisconsin madison a paper based on this study received the  association for library and information science education alise research paper award  school of library and information studies university of wisconsin madison helen c white hall  n park street madison wisconsin  library quarterly vol  no  pp   g  by the university of chicago all rights reserved      
challenges to library materials  in its understanding of intellectual freedom questions or in its preparation for and response to challenges to materials in libraries direct challenges to materials found in school libraries have been of particular concern to proponents of intellectual freedom yet aside from occasional studies and periodic status reports of challenge results little is known about the challenge process this article reports the results of the testing on a national level of a conceptual model that addressed the question what are the variables that are most likely to influence the outcome of challenges to school library materials at the secondary level for purposes of the present study challenge is defined as an oral or written complaint about the appropriateness of school library materials outcome is defined as the resolution of such a challenge and is viewed in terms of retention restriction or removal of challenged material in retention material that is thought to be appropriate for the school library remains on open shelves and is readily accessible to users of the library in restriction material that is thought to be suitable for some students in the school but questionable for others is given limited access such as placement on a restricted shelf for access only through the librarian or other authority figure in removal material that is thought to be inappropriate for the school and its students is taken out of the school library altogether the conceptual model on which the study is based was developed and discussed by dianne mcafee hopkins  the model was based on a review and analysis of intellectual freedom research in library and information science educational administration research including formal and informal organizations school climate and supervisorsubordinate relationships behavioral science research relating to personality power and authority and communications research including local media such as newspapers and community interactions in the model tested in the present study outcome of a challenge to school library material was seen as affected by five major classes of variables district materials selection policy school environment community environment initiator of the challenge and selected personal and professional characteristics of the librarian the research review suggested that the primary variables influencing whether library materials in school settings are retained restricted or removed are very complex and may well center around the school librarian and the principal and around the leadership or lack thereof that either or both exert throughout the challenge process in the field of library and information science the model was strongly influenced by the research and discussions of marjorie fiske  john j farley  charles h busha  claire st clere england  michael j pope  and judith serebnick  farley study focused specifically
 the library quarterly on school libraries fiske study included school and public libraries pope study included school public and college libraries busha and england focused on public libraries while the busha and england research is not generalizable to school libraries it is included because when examined along with other research in intellectual freedom the research offered background information or confirmed possible key variables for the research question the well known fiske study of book selection challenges and censorship focused on selected california school and public libraries in the s  it has been called the most influential research on intellectual freedom in us libraries  p  fiske findings offered useful information to the model in many areas including materials selection policy librarians characteristics such as length of service self esteem sense of pressure in selections and level of formal education school environment including the influence of the school administrator on the librarian community environment including the influence of local media and the initiator of the challenge farley  explored precensorship in acquisitions circulation and use of books in the collections of forty three senior high schools in nassau county new york he sought to ascertain responsibility and rationales for restrictions farley findings offered information useful to the model relating to librarians characteristics including length of professional service and to school environment including the influence of school administrators on the librarian busha  studied midwestern public librarians to determine their attitudes toward intellectual freedom censorship and selected authoritarian beliefs busha findings offered insights into librarians personal characteristics such as age level of formal education and authoritarian beliefs school environment including the possible influence of administrators on the librarian and community environment including the relationship between community size and librarians attitudes toward censorship england  studied public librarians in six cities in ontario canada she sought to discover attitudes and perceptual factors influencing what she termed the censorship activity of public librarians england findings provided information useful to the model in the areas of characteristics of the librarian including age and sense of pressure in selections and community environment pope  analyzed the opinions of school public and college librarians on sexually oriented literature pope findings offered useful information in the areas of characteristics of the librarian such as age and level of formal education and of school environment including the relationship between school enrollment and restrictiveness

 the library quarterly six statements including one developed by me were included in the questionnaire to provide gross estimates of dogmatism measures of self esteem were designed to gauge the librarian feeling of self worth the self esteem statements were selected from morris rosenberg self esteem test  pp   four statements including one developed by me were included in the questionnaire to measure gross estimates of self esteem all psychological measures were statements in which responses ranged from  strongly disagree to  strongly agree tables   provide frequency and percentage responses for the psychological measures based on all librarians reporting challenges along with means and standard deviations several statistical tests were performed on selected data from the questionnaire including t tests correlation coefficients and cronbach alpha for purposes of testing the scale of locus of control statements that measured internal locus of control was revised so that coding for internal and external locus of control was consistent the results of correlation coefficients and overall alpha value were examined to determine whether data from some statements should be deleted from the analysis for example statements whose removal resulted in a higher alpha for the set were considered for removal also statements with a correlation coefficient of less than  were studied carefully and considered for removal as a result of the examination statement number  was deleted from the analysis table  shows item to total correlation coefficients and alpha levels for the psychological statements resulting after the deletion in terms of external locus of control librarians did not feel they lacked influence over what happened to them feel powerless in affecting the outcome of complaints to library media center materials or feel that there was nothing the ordinary person could do in terms of internal locus of control respondents showed no clear pattern of agreement as to whether they believed chance or luck played an important role in their lives respondents agreed that getting people to do the right thing depended upon ability  the most common use of the t statistic is to test the probability that a parameter value is statistically different from  that is what is the likelihood that the effect that the parameter is measuring is real for this purpose the t statistic is calculated simply as the ratio of the parameter estimate to its standard error and the p value associated with the statistic is the probability that the parameter is equal to  correlation coefficients measure the agreement between two items a value of  indicates perfect agreement they include the same information and a value of  that they have no information in common negative values like positive values indicate amount of agreement but the values of one item tend to increase when values of the second item decrease
challenges to library materials  in terms of dogmatism in most instances respondents disagreed with statements that supported authority roles they did not feel that librarians should adhere to requests of the principal without question did not believe that there was only one correct philosophy in the world and did not agree that there was a need to rely on leaders or experts who could be trusted respondents did not feel there are only two kinds of people in the world those for the truth and those against the truth they did not agree that most people just do not know what is good for them respondents showed no clear pattern concerning whether it was upsetting when people stubbornly refused to admit that they were wrong in terms of self esteem respondents agreed that they have a number of good qualities that they take a positive attitude toward themselves and that on the whole they are satisfied with themselves of primary concern to the researcher was the question of whether differences among the respondents in their perceptions were significantly related to whether challenged materials were retained restricted or removed analyses of variance were used to determine whether there were significant differences in responses by outcome to challenged material data from some statements that measured dogmatism and locus of control showed significance according to the outcome of challenges to material there were no findings of significant differences for the self esteem variable when the outcome was retention the degree of internal locus of control was higher and librarians were less likely to feel a sense of powerlessness see table  thus in terms of locus of control as listed in statements   and  librarians who reported the retention of challenged material were less likely to agree that librarians are really powerless in affecting the outcome of materials than those who had material removed or restricted those who reported retention were less likely than those who reported removal to believe that the world is run by the few people in power and there is not much the ordinary person can do about it librarians who reported retention were less likely to agree that chance or luck plays an important role in their lives than those who reported removal data from statements  and  did not show significance according to outcome when the outcome was retention respondents were less dogmatic and less rigid in their absolute acceptance of the principal authority see table  thus in terms of dogmatism as listed in statements   and  those who reported retention were less likely than those who reported removal or restriction to agree that the librarian should adhere cronbach alpha is a measure of agreement among several items the scales and meanings for them parallel those of the correlation coefficient

 the library quarterly the model as well as other supportive library and information science reports and studies the discussion also provides a written summary of the model as revised including the major classes of variables and suggests areas of future research materials selection policy several studies focusing on the outcome of challenges have shown a positive relationship between the existence and use of the materials selection policy and the retention of challenged materials in the collection these studies include those of fiske  woodworth  wisconsin department of public instruction    limiting what students shall read  and bracy  the findings of the present study support this research more than two thirds of the respondents reported having a written board approved policy it was found that these policies resulted in the retention of materials more than other types of policies or no policy it was also found that when the policy was followed during a challenge material had a greater likelihood of retention of all variables examined use of a policy is the subject of the most research and is found most consistently to predict retention school environment studies by fiske  farley  and busha  all include a focus on the influence of the administrator on challenges the research suggests that the influence of the principal relates to challenge outcomes the study reported here supports the influence of the principal in the retention and the removal of materials the study shows that when the principal initiates a challenge material is likely to be removed and when the principal supports the librarian during a challenge material is likely to be retained a similar relationship exists when teachers provide support during a challenge pope  found a positive relationship between school size and retention this study supports that finding materials were retained less and removed more in schools with an enrollment below  they were retained more in schools of over  community environment fiske  suggested the hypothesis that press support from the local media could be influential in affecting outcome reports such as that of the wisconsin department of public instruction    and limiting what students shall read  found very little coverage by local media this study like the two latter found that few challenges were known outside the school and did not find that local media significantly affected outcome
challenges to library materials  busha  found a positive relationship between community size and public librarians intolerance of censorship this national study found no overall significant differences although not dealt with comprehensively in previous library and information science research support during a challenge was found to make a difference in outcome in this study the great majority of librarians in this study neither sought nor received assistance outside the district those who did however reported a higher rate of retention and a lower rate of removal than those who did not challenge initiator studies by fiske  woodworth  wisconsin department of public instruction  and jenkinson  generally found that complaints initiated by those outside the district that is those besides district staff such as parents resulted in retention more than those inside the district such as teachers and administrators this study confirmed the finding complaints from district administrators or principals usually resulted in removal while complaints from parents usually resulted in retention characteristics of school librarians characteristics of librarians relating to outcome differed from findings of most earlier research studies used in the development of the model this study found no statistically significant outcome differences based on years of teaching length of service as a librarian formal education gender age or sense of self esteem significant differences were found according to racial background and psychological measures of locus of control and dogmatism fiske  and farley  found positive relationships between restrictiveness and length of service while serebnick analysis  of intellectual freedom research found varied results fiske found low estimates of self worth among school librarians busha  england  and pope  found the librarian age to be related to restrictiveness although again research findings are not consistent with some other studies as discussed by serebnick fiske  busha  and pope  found a positive relationship between the extent of formal education and the least restrictive library environment locus of control has not been a major focus of previous studies in library and information science behavioral science research summarized by doob  indicates that persons beliefs affect their actions in terms of dogmatism research by fiske  farley  busha  and especially summaries of doob  suggested that the perceived power and authority of individuals could have a profound
 the library quarterly effect on roles assumed by librarians intellectual freedom studies of the past have not focused on librarians racial background complaint background complaint background was added as a category to the model after analyzing the study results neither form of complaint oral or written nor support for removal or retention of materials received sufficient focus in previous library and information science research to suggest them as major variables this study found that written complaints and active support for retention contributed to retention summary of model results of this national study have confirmed refuted and added variables that have been thought to influence whether challenged library materials are retained restricted or removed the study confirms that the issues involved are complex and suggests the following variables associated with the outcome of retention asterisks indicate variables also supported by the logistic regression analysis district selection policy a existence b use during a challenge process school environment a support of school principal during challenge b support of teachers during challenge c overall internal support received by librarian during challenge d size of school that is larger schools community environment a support librarian receives during challenge from outside the school initiator of challenge a parents b those generally outside school environment librarian characteristics a internal locus of control b low degree of dogmatism complaint background a written complaint b active support for retention the findings of this study offer opportunities for a systematic direction in the continued study of selected variables several additional areas of study can be identified based on existing data the research results focus on the importance of the school environment including the principal and teachers the present data can be
challenges to library materials  examined from these perspectives focusing for example on challenges to materials in which the principal or the teacher is the initiator are the subjects focused on by principals or teachers during the challenge different from those focused on by others to what extent is the policy followed when the principal or teachers initiate the challenge although few challenges were made known outside the school environment those covered by local media should be studied as a group far too little is known about the influence of local media on challenges to school library materials the psychological factors of dogmatism and locus of control need to be more carefully examined a beginning examination should include the relationships among librarians demographic and professional background variables and those measuring dogmatism and locus of control two areas of complaint background need further analysis the questionnaire data provide information on materials that were challenged in most instances a title was challenged only once however study of selected titles and the challenge process involved may provide insights into the nature of titles challenged more than once the second area of further study is by form of complaint oral and written challenges should be separated and studied in detail to provide more insight into their specific natures in addition the relationships between form of complaint and librarians measures of self esteem locus of control and dogmatism can be examined finally the findings of this study suggest the need for continued research beyond this study the relationship of the librarian to the principal should continue to be examined along with the effect of the subordinate role of the librarian in a hierarchical structure this includes further examination of the librarian attitude toward authority sense of dogmatism and locus of control and level of self esteem research in education particularly research on effective schools should be examined in terms of relationships within the school including those with teachers as well as with principals and responses to challenges the importance of internal and external support to the librarian during a challenge was a major finding of the study additional research could focus on support outside the district traditional sources of support for example were found to be less effective than other outside support the nature of effective support should be among the areas receiving further consideration the study reported here focused on challenges to library materials in public secondary schools and should be replicated future studies may also include a focus on challenges to materials at the elementary level finally as a major access concern long term rather than short term examination of challenges to materials seems warranted
