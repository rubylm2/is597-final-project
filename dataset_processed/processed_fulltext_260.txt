the great books discussion groups george f bowerman formerly when the term adult education was mentioned educated people usually thought it was of no concern to them individually but that it meant the teaching of illiterates perhaps foreign immigrants to read in order to prepare them for naturalization of late years it has somewhat generally come to connote the idea that formal education no matter to what advanced level it may be carried is only the beginning that education is lifelong and that unless our education becomes a life process we go backward and cease to be able to consider ourselves educated in other words there is no such thing as a completed education the psychologists tell us that ability to learn increases up to about the age of nineteen or twenty remains about the same up to the age of forty five and then starts slowly to decline but psychological studies also seem to indicate that with adults who continue the learning process ability to learn does not begin to diminish in middle age but remains at about the same high level until a much later period in order therefore to keep intellectually alive we must keep on learning such adult education is of course self education which may be carried on through utilizing various cultural advantages music art drama and especially literature the reading of books for the education of the young society furnishes the public school at first on a compulsory basis for adults it furnishes the public library on a voluntary basis viewing children as potential adults the public library has children rooms and sends books to schools for supplemental reading in the hope of inducing lifelong reading habits it has readers advisers and special departments of music art philosophy and religion science etc with specialists in charge who outline courses of reading if desired all to enable a constantly increasing number of people to continue their education to live richer lives to be better citizens all of these services and many more whose constant purpose has ever been individual and community enlightenment the washington public library has carried forward in increasing volume and intensity for more than fifty years during the last three years there has been added to the individual readerguidance services a program of discussion groups organized around the so called great books of western civilization which are read in advance and form the basis of the discussions for the past several months i have been an eager participant in certain of these groups in the preparation of this statement i have drawn upon my own satisfactory experience also somewhat heavily on what the leaders of the movement here and elsewhere have written in its exposition especially on articles by the director of the washington program dr john w powell by dr cyril  houle dean of university college university of chicago and on the io page manual for discussion leaders by professor mortimer j adler of the univeri a paper presented before the literary society of washington november  i 
the great books discussion groups  sity of chicago one of the principal proponents of this new but rapidly growing movement the program as it operates in washington consists of the groups the books and a leader for each group the program in its first year started with seven groups each of ten weeks duration followed by six also running ten weeks two years later there were nineteen groups going most groups meet weekly in two hour sessions although some meet bi weekly nearly all meet in branch libraries usually in children rooms after their evening closing hours a few meet mornings and these are mnainly composed of housewives registration for each group is usually restricted to twenty members are ordinarily seated around a big table with ash trays in evidence since the library no smoking rule has been suspended for this program to induce an atmosphere of informality in the first thirty months of the program in washington about a thousand different individuals came about twelve thousand times to about a thousand meetings of nearly one hundred groups for the purpose of discussing more than one hundred titles by seventy five authors the books consist for the most part of those sometimes known as the classics of the western world they have been used as far back as ii in the honors course at columbia university at cooper union new york in i since i at the university of chicago from i to i in san francisco in an adult school founded by alexander meiklejohn and since i they have formed together with mathematics the sciences and languages the core of the curriculum at st john college annapolis they are used in the washington program but with several modern titles added some of which scarcely rank as classics but nevertheless are useful in discussion groups the lists of the books used in the first two groups in which i participated and their sequences should be of interest one group read the following the declaration of independence plato apology and crito sophocles oedipus rex anda ntigone plato republic books i and ii aristotle politics book i thucydides history of the peloponnesian war book i aristotle ethics book i from plutarch lives  caesar and  alexander st augustine confessions books i viii st thomas aquinas treatise on law summa theologica books i and ii questions   machiavelli the prince montaigne selected essays and shakespeare hamlet and othello the other group readings consisted in sequence of the following shakespeare henry v hawthorne scarlet letter kant metaphysics of ethics tolstoi war and peace freud introduction to psychoanalysis tacitus the annals selections marx wagelabor and capital and the communist manifesto mead from the south seas federalist papers nos i and io and the education of henry adams dostoievski the brothers karamazov was to have been a part of this second sequence but had to be omitted as the inexpensive  modern library edition was out of print for last summer group discussions the staple was the newly published abridgment of the first six volumes so far issued of arnold j toynbee a study of history along with this great work there were read and discussed the celebrated chapters xv and xvi of gibbon decline and fall devoted to the early progress of christianity and the policy of the roman government toward it there were four summer sections
 the library quarterly using these two titles another summer group used adam smith the wealth of nations veblen the vested interests and lilienthal tva democracy on the march the scheduled reading of several of the groups now in progress contains in addition to orthodox great books the first and third of james t farrell trilogy studs lonigan which called forth much thoughtful and animated discussion in the group of which i am a member it may be reassuring to note that in connection with the reading and discussion of these books some by so called pagan authors the book of job genesis chapters i and  as well as other portions of the bible are read much is made of the order in which the books are read and discussed that is by subject matter by historical period by literary type or because some common problem is involved such as war and peace or freedom and law most of the books used are available in inexpensive editions such as the modern library  everyman library etc the washington public library regularly purchases about twenty five copies of each title in order to be able to furnish a copy to each member of a group it has been interesting to observe that a good many members purchase personal copies through leaders at a discount and are thus building up their private libraries it should be noted that so far as public participation in this program is concerned the service is free as are all public library services the leader of each group is a highly important part of the program he is not and should not be its teacher and he is preferably not an expert in the subject matter of the book under discussion or there would be the danger that he might lecture or otherwise monopolize the conversation best results are obtained when he or she is a well informed person with interest in people problems and ideas who has read the book or passage more intensively than any of the group and comes prepared with questions that will bring out the vital points at present all leaders other than the director and assistant director of the program consist of certain members of the library staff who have other regular duties together with other persons from outside the library who as members of previous discussion groups have shown aptitude for such service and who have had some instruction and practice in a special discussion group conducted by the library for the purpose of training group leaders these discussion groups are not courses of study leading to a degree nor for credits toward a degree their aim is not vocational education but liberal education fortunately there has been in the undergraduate colleges of late an effort to get away from hit and miss electives and vocational studies and to put more emphasis on well co ordinated liberal studies though liberal education may and should begin in school and college undergraduates or recent graduates are usually too immature too lacking in experience fully to grasp the ideas involved in a liberal education these embrace the great basic problems of human life and society such as happiness tragedy good and evil justice and injustice poverty and wealth immortality freedom and security war and peace the individual and the state science and religion etc four groups of titles have been given of the books used in these discussions out of a larger list of titles most of which are regarded as the great books of western civilization they are well suited for reading and group discussion in a program of adult liberal education inasmuch as they consist of the great works of
the great books discussion groups  philosophy and history of science and poetry and deal with the fundamental problems which mankind has had to meet throughout the ages they represent various sides of major issues they do not settle things but by introducing us to great intellectual controversies they bid us make up our own minds the authors of these books are the original minds of our civilization our greatest teachers they challenge and stimulate us although these books are hundreds or thousands of years old they treat of the principal issues of today they are written not for specialists but for ordinary men and women while parts of them may be ver our heads once they are understood they are more rewarding than lesser books if what has been said concerning the value of reading the great books for a liberal education has been persuasive one may ask why such liberal education may not be secured simply by the solitary reading of them in the first place few will have the fortitude to carry through such a private reading program to give a personal experience i who have spent my adult life among books and have had at least an official nodding acquaintance with most of the titles used in all the group reading programs here and elsewhere and have had in addition a fairly wide reading interest and experience i must nevertheless confess to have read only a small fraction of these books known to be great i had long known that i really ought to have read them but newspapers magazines and current books have for the most part crowded them out so when i learned somewhat late that the public library had this program i decided better late than never the incentive of needing to have read recently the book or passage to be discussed was effective as no simple good resolution would have been furthermore i have got more out of this reading by reason of the discussions that followed solitary reading may become a secret vice resulting in intellectual isolation and ministering to private prejudices the opposite of a man with a liberal education is one with a closed mind one who looks for and will seriously consider only such statements as agree with what he already believes even to read aloud a great book to one person and then to discuss it as has long been my habit has advantages provided there is real discussion and reader and listener do not think too much alike the value of the group discussion comes in part from the fact that no group is altogether homogeneous each group includes people with different experiences and different temperaments with differences in formal education in age in occupation and in social background the result is that there are not two opinions as in the case of one person reading aloud to another but a whole set of views about the book with a smaller chance for misconceptions and misinterpretations this not only results in better comprehension of the book under discussion but also makes for better understanding of our fellow men and for greater tolerance of the ideas of others by reason of the give and take of others focused on the same question in the discussion at the beginning of any series of group discussions the members are likely to be comparative strangers to one another to make the program a success it is important not only that every member should read the book or passage in advance but that the attendance should be regular the meetings may be likened to a college seminar in fact are so called in
the library quarterly chicago but lectures by the leader are strictly taboo the book is the teacher the leader functions by using modifications of the so called socratic method that is by questions that will bring out answers that will require more and more questions and then more and more answers and not final answers at that thus there will be brought out not only the root idea in the book under discussion but worth while ideas that may be brought to birth in the participants minds who are the people who make up these discussion groups in washington the director of the program reports that a sampling questionnaire brought answers from two hundred individuals of whom two thirds are the products of college or graduate schools the remaining third have had only high school or business training foreign nationalities represented in the groups range from australians to africans with a number from central europe thirty six different states were represented largely from the new york new england area and from the midwest with the south third only about twenty negro members were included among the one thousand participants although some effort was made to recruit more most of these were in group meetings in the small branch library in a negro housing development and there were a few in some predominantly white groups the largest occupational group consisted of professional management and executive personnel of whom the largest proportion were men about  per cent of all groups were men housewives form perhaps i  per cent of all groups since government is washington principal industry clerical workers constitute a large part of every group with manual and service trades low a few military service personnel several college undergraduates and even a few senior high school students were included most group members were found to be already book readers and library card holders but the questionnaire showed that the books used in the groups were new to most members by means of this program the great old books heretofore only occasionally asked for are galvanized into life and become subjects of study and discussion it may be assumed that most people who join these groups and read the assigned texts do so to make up deficiencies in their reading and so more or less deliberately seek further education but it is also no doubt true that some members are lonely and seek social and intellectual companionship in these groups from my experience and observation i judge that some of those joining are rather contentious by nature and seek an outlet for such proclivities although the leaders try to hold the discussion to the theme seeming irrelevancies are tolerated often these prove to be applications of the subject of the book to men and events of today for example the character and motives of such men as henry wallace senator mckellar stalin and molotov i understand that one man was not tolerated who confessed regularly that he had not read the assigned book but had read several encyclopedia articles about the subject and insisted on retailing them britannica articles are good as supplements but not as substitutes all is not sweetness and light in these discussion groups occasionally recurring themes were the sins of big business the trusts the rich the newspapers and other similar topics some of which added spice to the proceedings to me a heartwarming incident was the impassioned statement of a young woman student in
the great books discussion groups  a local catholic college that she had served as a picket before the national theater in the cause of admitting negroes it has been interesting to observe that certain members who have probably been attending these groups from the beginning often quote previously read authors who also treated the subject of the book under discussion and compare the two pitting one against the other some people have asked as i did why this program is so predominantly devoted to the old books and why presentday books would not do as well or better among the answers given were first that since such groups are made up of readers many members will already have read the current books and second that most modern books are derivative in that the fundamental ideas in them have already been expressed and perhaps better expressed in one or another of the great books and so do not so well hold the attention of readers and groups as an example it was stated that a group in san francisco took up one of the books of stuart chase but soon became sick of him and was about to break up when adam smith the wealth of nations was substituted with a successful outcome for another example most modern writers on world government from streit to reves derive their basic arguments from the federalist papers the groups read the federalist themselves and build their own thinking from there the job of the groups is to do the same kind of thinking that chase or reves or streit did rather than to rehearse the conclusions that those men reached the basic distinction between books which are or are not useful to a group is not a matter of dates it is simply the distinction between original and secondary thinking a few incidents growing out of the program here and elsewhere may illustrate its effectiveness lifelong beliefs have been radically changed as a result of the discussions it is related that a declared communist attended great books discussions in chicago for two years with the result that he joined the dominican order a visitor to a big heating equipment plant in indianapolis seeing a dozen workmen at the lunch hour each eating a sandwich and reading a papercovered book asked them if they were studying roberts rules of order in preparation for a union meeting to his surprise one replied impatiently no wee reading aristotle ethics that factory had its discussion group attended by welders and other mechanics as well as by men and women from the office and the engineering and sales forces in washington there is plenty of humor in the comments for example at one of the three meetings when the education of henry adams was the subject of discussion a young newspaperman who was apparently fed up with some of the posings of adams remarked that probably he wasn so muclh to blame since he came from that cesspool of culture boston in addition to many letters received by the director of the program highly commending their own leaders and expressing appreciation of the public library role in conducting such groups the following incidents are significant when the announcement was made that there would be summer groups one young woman asked eagerly for the exact dates saying that she wanted to plan her vacation so as not to miss any of the meetings as mr john cheney the assistant director was showing his pass when boarding a streetcar the motorman said hello mr cheney when does our group start again a policeman on the beat where director powell lives stopped him to say that he had just
the library quarterly bought himself a fine copy of voltaire candide which he had read in a group a man from new orleans in a group where aristotle politics was under discussion after a lively but good natured argument on slavery with a negro girl remarked as a matter of fact this is the first time i ever sat at the same table with a colored person then there was the young man who was being examined for a foreign service post by state department personnel who supported his answer by citing de tocqueville which he had been reading with a group to such purpose that he is now in india for the state department finally there was the man who held an important post with one of the local public utilities who in answer to a question on a labor matter from the head of the labor relations department quoted something out of the veblen he had been reading in a group his comment was boy if i hadn been with them for thirty years i sure be hunting a job now at the close of the last season sessions there was held a general meeting to which members of all the reading groups were invited about two hundred and fifty came the meeting opened with the showing of two short films on atomic energy one world or none and the tale of two cities followed by a discussion of quotations from the education of henry adams which had filled such an important place in the reading and discussion of some half dozen groups during the year although this assembly was too large a group to have the most successful discussion dr powell somehow managed it well hooking up the films with that part of the adams book written long before the atom bomb was made in which adams asks what kind of a new social mind will be required to deal with the unlimited power that he saw coming those in attendance felt the weightiness of the issues without being able to make any final answer to adams question after other discussion the meeting was brought to a close by a strong plea for the mutual understanding of all peoples this eloquent speech which served as benediction was made without mention of race or color by the negro librarian of the public library only branch in a negro housing development who was also a co leader of a discussion group the public library discussion group program is only one of several somewhat similar enterprises among other cities to which it has already spread are chicago detroit indianapolis cleveland milwaukee seattle and portland under the leadership of mr ralph a beals director of the new york public library that library has just launched an extensive program for which one hundred leaders have been in training most of the other cities are more or less under the guardianship of local or near by universities rather than strictly under public library direction as is the case in washington another way in which most of the others differ from washington is that each group has two leaders in a sense interlocutors rather than only one leader for each group as is usually the case here washington now fall of i has eighteen groups in progress eleven of these are led by volunteers of whom eight work in pairs and six alone as already indicated this program was started in january i by miss clara w herbert learning that education fund inc which meant dr robert m hutchins chancellor of the university of chicago was desirous of spreading the gospel of great books miss herbert as librarian modestly asked for sooo to start the program here but dr
the great books discussion groups  scott buchanan then dean of st john who investigated the washington plans recommended a grant of ooo at first there was further help and advice from annapolis but finally dr powell with somewhat similar experience in san francisco was brought into the picture and has carried on as director since september  originally the grant funds were used to buy the extra copies of books needed as well as to pay the director and some of the leaders but the grant will soon be exhausted and then if the program is to be continued appropriations for personnel will be required it is to be hoped that the program will have sufficiently justified itself to insure the necessary appropriations by congress while this paper was in preparation news came from chicago of the organization of the great books foundation a nonprofit corporation with dr robert m hutchins as chairman the announcement predicted that by the fall of  more than  american men and women from all walks of life will be reading the great books of the western world and meeting  to discuss them many  will be participating in the program for the first time others will be in their second third or fourth year of it and there are some who will be beginning their fifteenth year according to the prospectus the sole purpose of the foundation is to assist those who are interested in establishing  groups for reading and discussion of the great books since it has been found here and elsewhere that book purchases for these programs have in many cases exhausted the publishers stocks of certain of the books used in groups the foundation proposes to enlist the aid of the publishers to keep the titles in print and also itself to provide at low cost reprints of the readings some of which are available only as parts of larger and more costly works the foundation will also assist in the training of laymen as group leaders and will publish descriptive material for use in local publicity telling of the purpose and method of the great books program the foundation will be financed in part from contributions from those who believe in the program and in part by the profits from the sale of large quantity printings of reprints used by groups the announcement lists several more places where leader training programs are under way including one in vancouver bc and one in the veterans administration of the seattle area with most metropolitan centers to follow it is expected to enlist not only public libraries as here and at several other places but also parent teacher associations community centers service clubs labor unions and other institutions the foundation envisions a wide acceptance of this form of adult education as indicated at the beginning education is a never ending lifelong process the beauty of the plan of reading the great books and then of discussing them with groups is that many of the books are re readable and that there are enough of them to last out any lifetime as an evangelist of the gospel of adult education through the medium of the great books discussion groups i do not hope to entice anyone away from radio soap opera programs or anyone away from poker pinochle or bridge but to those to whom this program makes a strong appeal i can promise much fun great satisfaction and real happiness
