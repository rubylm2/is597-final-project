women in southern library education  did this condition prevail this article recounts the rise of women in southern library education and identifies regional factors which insured a long lived female monopoly over the field  the southern historical identity and the isolation of southern librarians from the national professional agenda  the prevalence of stronger regional gender norms with respect to higher education  the supremacy of the library school at the carnegie library of atlanta and the lack of southern male library students before   regional racial and religious mores which required female compliance as well as courage in extending library opportunity to the dispossessed and  the presence of a network of atlanta library school alumnae who served as gatekeepers for the limited job market surprisingly little has been written about the role of women in southern library education though the subject is implicit in standard works on libraries in the south florrinell morton chronicled the growth of southern library education in terms of changing national and regional standards  while mary edna anders as part of her doctoral dissertation defined the growth of southern library education as a corollary to the public library movement in the region  betty callaham supplied a detailed administrative account of the library school at the carnegie library of atlanta later the division of library and information science of emory university the first and for several years   the only accredited graduate library school in the region  by far the most comprehensive review of southern library education has been edward holley  which balances a detailed chronological account with some consideration of regionalism james carmichael has profiled the graduates of the atlanta school  particularly tommie dora barker  who was for thirty four years head of the atlanta program arthur gunn has examined the history of the library school at hampton institute  while rosemary du mont summarized the problems of educating black librarians in the united states  robert martin in reviewing the early career of louis round wilson has left a vivid picture of wilson struggle to establish a library school at the university of north carolina at chapel hill although the focus of his dissertation was on wilson contributions as a university change agent  brief published studies and master theses have reviewed the histories of other individual southern schools  pp    to these historical works should be appended the various surveys of southern library after  work with children was still universally viewed as part of woman sphere of work the first male student did not matriculate until   at atlanta no such explicit restrictions on the entrance of males existed

women in southern library education  male librarians working in the south the importance of regional attitudes may explain the relative paucity of male southern public library directors well into the s for whatever reasons the rosenwald scholarships had a negligible effect on male enrollment in the emory library school after the scholarship program discontinuance in  no males entered the school in  or  and not until after the introduction of the gi bill did as many as three men enter a single class whether southern men avoided the library school program simply because it lacked the dynamism and potential earning power of emory more prestigious offerings in programs like law and medicine or because the tradition of southern female librarianship had become entrenched in the popular imagination may never be conclusively demonstrated the existence of the rosenwald program does illustrate the severity of the male shortage in the national perception of southern librarianship it is doubtful however that the majority of atlanta female graduates perceived the shortage as an impediment to furthering library extension in the south race rivalry and the female network the rivalry among some southern female librarians for dominance in the region library affairs and their differing philosophies on racial policy indirectly affected the development of several aspects of southern library education knoxville mary utopia rothrock who presided over the first three conferences of the southeastern library association sela at signal mountain and asheville in   and  both as president   and unofficial hostess became slightly piqued when tommie dora barker third sela president   moved the conference to biloxi supposedly because the mountains of north carolina and tennessee provided a more central location she became vitriolic however when barker was elected to the post of regional field agent for the south for the american library association a position rothrock had tailored to her own specifications  p  atlanta dominance in southern library affairs further fueled rothrock resentment at the pervasive presence of the atlanta library school contingent at sela conferences mary eileen ahern noted the presence of the two coalitions at sela meetings as early as  the largest number being in the tennessee group while the one with the most dignified and intellectual atmosphere was that gathered at the table set aside for the library school of the carnegie library of atlanta  p  rothrock threw herself behind the formation of a rival school at the university of tennessee in  and bogle wisely noted that even
 the library quarterly though rothrock was agin most things    she recognizes tennessee need of trained librarians  on the other hand she would not want to be left out of a program but her outlook is purely local  rothrock a memphis native graduated from the new york state library school in  was snobbish about the library school training of her employees and several times backed out of employment negotiations with barker for atlanta graduates if we can have both thorough training and native ability she wrote we prefer the latter of course we would like also a good disposition and adaptability in short we want albany quality  nevertheless when demand for librarians exceeded supply rothrock and her assistant helen harris continued to hire emory graduates in knoxville and later in libraries of knoxville and the tennessee valley authority two rival branches of a southern female network thus consisted of the tennessee librarians and the atlanta graduates and while their purposes were often at odds their similarities ultimately outweighed their differences barker rothrock and templeton among several others had actually drawn up plans for a regional association together while making the long train ride to the  ala conference at denver   pp   templeton did not have the same investment in representing her state or city as did rothrock or for that matter barker for this reason perhaps she ceded the position of ala regional field agent to barker when the sela policy committee could not decide between barker and templeton the barker rothrock relationship was alternately civil and stormy when atlanta graduate lucile nix class of  failed to receive a recommendation from rothrock for a state job to which she felt eminently entitled barker found her an equally prominent job with the state government in atlanta and years later used rothrock slight as a pretext for ignoring requests for survey information from knoxville  another important component of the female network thrived independently at the state department county city and university levels and it often clashed with the atlanta axis of influence which was synonymous in some southern minds with ala influence relationships in this professional network occasionally resembled those of a genteel mafia willie welch an atlanta graduate then working as alabama state school library supervisor in  sabotaged barker long campaign to win alabama governor bibb graves to the public library idea by convincing him that school library work would have to precede public library development  july    barker then serving as ala re ms dickson  was a long time employee of the library served under rothrock and was acting director at the time of this interview
women in southern library education  gional field agent for the south knew more than even wilson about personnel and conditions in the southern field and had already encountered problems with female scruples when working on the southern survey with bogle in  louise richardson far from confident that barker would give an impartial evaluation of her classes in tallahassee asked bogle to conduct the survey in her state as did representatives in alabama and virginia it is important to emphasize at this point that barker knowledge of the field grew directly from her management of the atlanta school which served as a training agency employment bureau and pacesetter in the pecking order for librarians of the south the southern field was further fractured during the s and s over the question of the location of a library school for blacks whereas the rivalry over the home base of regional dominance in library affairs was really a cosmetic concern the location of the library school for blacks concerned fundamental racial philosophy black education like white education was in the process of evolution in the s while the issue of coeducation was raised on black campuses across the south in the s however a more threatening question was posed by the proper educational model to be followed the carnegie corporation decision to locate a library school for black librarians at hampton virginia in part represented a throwback to an earlier generation of educational philosophy the hampton institute founded in  provided a symbolic bridge across which amicable relations would be restored between north and south principally through northern philanthropy and the uplift of blacks  pp   similarly the choice of hampton as a location for a black library school seems to have represented an intermediate solution between the industrial model of education exemplified by tuskeegee institute and more radical liberal arts models then being proposed elsewhere the founding of the hampton institute library school came at a particularly crucial period when librarians of the north and south could not otherwise agree on racial policy in libraries the work with negroes roundtable had been abandoned after an impassioned discussion of segregated services apparently led by rothrock at the hot springs ala conference of  wilson recommendation to the bel to locate the school at hampton then struggling to break free of its industrial education mold into a true liberal arts college thus represented a concession to the traditional model of black education controlled by white teachers and administrators the news of the selection of hampton as a site riled anne wallace who had come out of retirement in  to revive the drexel library school not least of all because her vice director florence rising curtis left drexel to head the new school 
 the library quarterly though blacks could gain admission into certain northern and midwestern library schools documentary evidence and reminiscences of librarians like virginia lacey jones repudiate official statements that they were accepted on a par with white students    p  hampton was already a coeducational institution and the library school was open to students of both sexes but curtis complained to sarah bogle in  that so far no men are available  the administration tight surveillance over the relations of male and female students at hampton ultimately led to a student revolt in  although the library school students remained aloof from the conflict   pp    pp     it was five years before hampton could attract its first male student theodus lafayette gunn  p  curtis a quaker dedicated wholly to the improvement of black education through libraries and literacy was an inspirational choice for director of the school wallace van jackson credited her with making possible through countless field visits and consultations with graduates of the hampton program the accreditation of many black colleges and universities through improvements to their libraries and collections  although the official reason given for the closing of the library school at hampton in  was financial and the unofficial reason was that according to curtis   a school was needed to take up where hampton left off that is a graduate school more probably the imminent retirement of curtis and the lack of a forthcoming replacement finally tipped the scales that hampton library school represented a temporary solution to the shortage of black libraries and librarians in the south was evident soon after it opened rothrock vied with barker for relocation of the hampton institute library school in tennessee well before the official demise of that program she let it be known through rosenwald fund representative clark foreman in  that she disapproved of the hampton program because of its physical location and because the hampton institute itself had yet to rise above its reputation as a technical rather than a liberal arts institution perhaps the fact that curtis was not a native southerner and therefore could not sympathize with rothrock ambiguous views on racial matters made her uneasy at any rate she employed an evasive argument about tennessee central location an argument that wilson had wielded in justifying selection of the hampton site in  and proposed a new program to be located at fisk university  at the same time atlanta university president john hope and greenville librarian charlotte templeton an intimate of barker were discussing plans for the new library on his campus including potential expansion room for library school quarters  templeton was in the thick of library education for blacks just having
women in southern library education  headed a summer school session for teacher librarians at spelman institute only the depression reined in any immediate plans rosenwald carnegie or the general education board may have had for replacing hampton program although the future of the school was a source of concern throughout the  s internecine squabbles over race politics and regional dominance frequently colored the deliberations of southern librarians after  that southern female library educators most notably barker became actively engaged in the debate and resolution of controversial questions gives some indication of the degree to which library work and library education in the south were married the base of power for southern female library educators lay in their ability to recommend graduates for posts to approve or condemn the effects of national association policy on library development in the region and to interpret for students the meaning of library work in a changing south social and political custom which favored the preeminence of women in educational affairs also forced their compliance with the conservative white interracial philosophy of black uplift which limited the choice of curricular offerings and educational experiences to those deemed appropriate by white males in this sense their activities were circumscribed to an advisory nature in deliberations of the funding agencies and the american library association who relied on the decisions of southern males like robert e lester of the carnegie corporation librarian louis round wilson and carl milam of the american library association to establish a regional agenda of library development discussion as professionals southern female librarians were bound to their region by a network of shared acquaintance and library training adapted to meet the conditions of a legally segregated economically deprived and educationally backward society even if women did not always hold the positions of leadership in the field they maintained their position in library education where they outfitted recruits for the whole gamut of employment possibilities from the one person library to the corporate city system and from professional work as menial as book mending to incidental work as challenging as drafting library legislation perseverance occasionally paid too even in the field the city of birmingham officially declared chapman director of the birmingham system in  and she remained in that position until her retirement in  there are many other sociological and historical factors which may explain why the phenomenon of female dominance in southern library
 the library quarterly education until  was not a random demographic occurrence but none of them completely explains why southern female librarians maintained their leadership position for so long the numerical gender imbalance between males and females on the eastern seaboard particularly in the latter half of the nineteenth century certainly created the necessary preconditions for the availability of a female work force whose prospects of marriage were doubtful also southern women entered traditionally male occupations following the civil war in order to survive although southern female librarians of the first generation came from upper middle class backgrounds many of them had grown up in families directly affected by the personal tragedies of the war and the financial reversals of reconstruction librarianship provided them with respectability and an opportunity to test their traditional mettle in circumstances at the same time primitive and patrician the southern female librarian could prove herself the equal to whatever circumstances local library conditions afforded armed with the most attractive appearance    the best southern manner but coupled with that    hardheartedness and good judgement to a very unusual extent  men on the other hand were apt to be viewed askance for accepting all but the highest paid positions especially if they had wives and family who would be subjected to the reduced earning prospects of library work it is hardly accidental then that the most prominent of the rosenwald male scholars errett w mcdiarmid made his most outstanding contribution to the profession outside the south certainly a most pervasive factor acting in favor of the predominance of women in southern librarianship was the cult of southern womanhood to which the atlanta school catered and the perception of library work as part of women sphere ironically the acceptance of male authority on library boards and in university management for example complemented the corollary male cognizance of female superiority in library work the myth of the power behind the throne was not at all figurative and the southern gender norms served to smooth the way on southern campuses for female educators in appropriate studies such as librarianship the perpetual state of southern educational crisis made even more imminent by the great depression and the relatively simple organizational structures of southern colleges and universities fostered informal networks of administrative support that encouraged the feminized southern library education program as library educa errett w mcdiarmid was best known as director of the university of minnesota library   and founding director of the library education program at that institution   he was elected ala president in  
women in southern library education  tion a professional venture endorsed by enlightened southern university administrators flourished the female library educator gained acceptance as was customary in other nascent professional fields at the time the female library educator often earned her standing through experience and renown rather than through her academic credentials barker for example never finished her college work at agnes scott but was given an honorary doctorate by emory in  the first such degree awarded by emory to a female the university of georgia awarded a similar degree in  to anne wallace howland the founder of the atlanta school and in  to jessica hopkins who succeeded barker as atlanta librarian taken together the three ceremonies represented a most fitting tribute to the traditions of training and practice which women had adapted to fit the southern environment barker in particular exemplified the female library academic sans ba degree it was by force of southern gender norms and the confluence of these norms with the perception of librarianship as predominantly women work that barker enjoyed a certain degree of carte blanche even after the school was placed in a university setting her circumstances were enviable from either a male or female point of view southern female library educators experienced special limitations and opportunities due to regional gender role expectations and these in turn were influenced by reduced professional expectations of the southern region throughout this article some reference has necessarily been made to examples from the field of library practice for in the south as in perhaps no other region education for librarianship was shaped by conditions in the field and cultural norms including the southern ideology surrounding womanhood to this extent practice overlapped with theory to a remarkable degree certainly there are economic factors which explain why women prevailed in librarianship and library education in the south but cultural factors regional predilections and professional politics played an equally important role of course the south was not a country apart evidence of most if not all of the general characteristics discussed in this study could probably be found in the experience of librarians from other parts of the united states the degree to which these characteristics were present among southern librarians however legal as opposed to de facto segregation for example rendered the characteristics more visible as aberrations indeed southern character stands out in sharp relief against the occasionally flat and linear chronicles of american library history further research into regional factors affecting library education and librarianship in other parts of the country may serve to restore a lost dimension to historical accounts of the profession
