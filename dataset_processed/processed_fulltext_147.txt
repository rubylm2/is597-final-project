mobilization of rural libraries  in rural access to technology computers and the internet that are still prevalent in the twentyfirst century at multiple levels in widespread expanses in every part of the country it is a grave mistake to assume that rural libraries have the same technological access as those in urban areas the rural communities in the united states whether they are along the appalachian trail in idaho and the dakotas in utah or kansas are scattered over vast geographically isolated territories giant telecommunication service providers such as att and comcast have undervalued these rural tracts as prospective markets to amass profits invest resources and advance technological developments eg by financing fiber optic cables delivering high speed internet because of the low population density in these far flung regions this has resulted in a conscious disenfranchisement of rural populations they are in a catch  where they have prospects dissimilar to their urban counterparts but also limited finances and other resources because companies and industries consider it unprofitable to locate there as a result of the lack of technology infrastructure lardner and smith  over decades this brutal pattern has left these areas with fewer jobs and increased unemployment causing people to leave furthermore rural populations lack of technological access provides them no benefits of modern technologies resulting in no workforce opportunities perpetuating meager salaries and wages curtailing purchasing power and restricting reserves for professional and personal growth corporate america and american capitalism have thus disenfranchised individuals from rural areas pushing them into the double jeopardy of inequitable technological access and reduced economic benefit from technology gallardo  second an understanding of the american rural public as left behind when the world is witnessing a technological revolution is related to a beyond access assessment of technology adoption and the prerequisite to move the discourse to emphasize technology use instead of just technological access information literacy competency or technological literacy skill is relevant in this context the american library association  defines information literacy competency as a set of abilities for an individual to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate evaluate and use effectively the needed information par  or technological tools and applications that provide the information the middle states commission on higher education  which builds on the association of college and research libraries  definition of a related concept of information fluency defines information literacy as determining the nature and extent of needed information accessing information effectively and efficiently evaluating critically information and its sources incorporating selected information in the learners knowledge base and value system using information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose understanding the economic legal and social issues surrounding the use of information and information technology and observing laws regulation and institutional policies related to the access and use of information  james rettig rural satellite and cable systems loan guarantee proposal and the digital divide in rural america hearing before the committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry united states senate th cong

mobilization of rural libraries  her private emails was to blame par  two other significant reasons behind clintons defeat were discussed in the press one was unfounded charges of corruption felony mishandling of classified information including    closely guarded intelligence secrets the misappropriation and destruction of    government records mccarthy  par  the other was the covert russian campaign to interfere in the us presidential election and intelligence officials belief of russian president vladimir putins personal involvement in the election hack used as a vendetta against clinton arkin dilanian and mcfadden  the involvement of the fbi a supposedly nonpartisan agency and the intense attention to the criminal charges against clinton from which she was exonerated is in itself worthy of critical scrutiny but beyond the scope of this article what is extremely problematic are the allegations of the russian foreign hand in the presidential election eg their infiltration of the democratic national committee e mail servers hacking of private e mail accounts of democratic political figures passing of those e mail communicationsand not the hacked data from the republican national committeeto wikileaks leading to the unfavorable coverage of clintons campaign and giving credence to theories that moscow actively favored trump fisher  par  the evidence in any assessment of russian government motives is circumstantial par  but does not diminish the seriousness of russias intervention in the election which appears to be unprecedented par  another fact that emerged during the  presidential election was the difference in the results between the electoral college vote and the popular vote this was similar to the  election when al gore won the popular vote by around  votes yet had to concede victory to his opponent based on the electoral colleges archaic assed winner take all system that shifted our focus to those few hundred votes in south florida which led to court challenges a supreme court decision and president georgew bush lyon  par  in the final electoral college counts clinton received  votes and trump got  votes based on final popular vote counts clinton got  votes  whereas trump got  votes  lagging behind with  votes  wasserman  yet he won that does not seem fair if one takes into account the american belief that each human being is equally important and that his or her voice and life are of as much value as any others when it came to the  presidential election this aspect was irrelevant because in reality every american vote did not hold the same weight and the american president was chosen based on the current electoral college system rigged as it is against democracy cohen  the outdated convoluted way of the electoral college from the eighteenth century described in article ii section  of the us constitution originated in response to severe eco  towin  presidential election interactive map towin  httpwwwtowincom_election interactive_map

mobilization of rural libraries  there is no definite answer to any of these provocative questions and maybe all these aspects and more have some relevance to the discussion yet the truth of the matter is the reality of president trumps victory which is based on the current practice of politics and the political process in the united states in this volatile environment in the aftermath of the  presidential election when the moral fiber of the nation is under question all around the world rural libraries emerge as critical and reflective providers of accurate political information that might help the public decode recent and ongoing political experiences and expose the differences between the ideals and the realities of american politics that the above questions raise furthermore responding to the process of the  presidential election and the traumatic experience and journey that the nation has witnessed rural libraries now have to step up and take a much more dynamic and critical role as emblematic and literal spaces of resistance in exposing the dirty aspects of american politics touched upon in this article the critique highlights the function of rural libraries to apply and operationalize political information literacy and fluency in promoting reflections public discourse and public training on the one hand and in actively mobilizing political information advocacy on the otherin education and activism on to name a few topics the nature of american democracy and political information the difference between myth and reality in american politics american politics as primarily an entertainment business and the hegemonic nexus of american politics the news media the entertainment industry and corporations it is imperative in these difficult times and in years to come that rural libraries take a leadership role in blowing the whistle on these aspects of american politics that are often ignored or barely touched upon in media coverage and on election campaign efforts that try only to foment political agitation and shape public opinion to manipulate niche voting blocs among the diverse publics to support one candidate or the other this article highlights some of the contentious themes as threads in the authentic nature of american politics based on the political experiences during and since the  presidential election readers should draw implications for rural libraries in promoting political information literacy fluency and advocacy through their resources programs services and political information access if nothing else one aspect has become absolutely clear while contemplating the three presidential debates the entire  election campaign and the coverage of the politics since including episodes of tv talk shows discussing politics eg the late show with stephen colbert on cbs the oreilly factor on fox news face the nation on cbs news hardball with chris matthews on msnbc the intertwining relationship between entertainment and politics and politics and entertainment is certainly blurred and their mixture is more complex than the american public realizes and is not critiqued by the mainstream press in a significant manner when reading between the lines of alec baldwins mimicking of president trump on saturday night live for example the spoofing of recent political occurrences and interactions also reveals a

mobilization of rural libraries  moreover little current evidence indicates that contemporary libraries or librarians have more than a few seats at the table of influence and authority in rural networks where crucial economic verdicts get made laws passed and policies devised that modulate every facet of rural public life moreover local politics have tremendous power over libraries and what they can or cannot do in rural communities the limiting and facilitating realities are frequently tied to the dictates and imposing disposition of religious and political control in preserving an addiction to faith and belief over rationality maintaining entrenched economic disparities the rural library also has to tackle the bureaucracy presently embodied in unreceptive or micromanaging library boards poor rankings of the library and education by public administrators and an absence of local library advocacy rural librarians can defy these deeply rooted prejudices shaping belief and institutional systems of praxis internal and external by venturing out of their spaces of privilege and their inner directed long embraced ways of practice to transform themselves and public perceptions about them as community anchors and advocates of change fuller  building partnerships that nurture collaborations across community boundaries be they with local politicians and government officials small businesses and chambers of commerce or other movers and shakers in rural settings is a strategy that might lead to change of the status quo of economic disparity and of traditional dicta of authority and control educating and empowering people as change agents is another way for various stakeholders at individual societal and community levels to alter their specific marginalized conditions probing the unhealthy ties among corporations politicians and religion is another action that rural librarians can spearhead to help eradicate the blind faith ignorance and intolerance that is believed to thrive in rural communities this will necessitate librarians taking ownership of their community advocacy role a stance they have historically denied themselves fearful of breaking out of the restricted neutral spectator mold imposed from within and without this is especially important for the rural library to become the place to further economic and political development and community building efforts to revitalize the economy create jobs and workforce opportunities and help in the cultural growth and economic fulfillment of its residents bishop mehra and partee ii  mehra bishop and partee ii  conclusion the controversies that were widely debated in forums during the  presidential election seem to have been partially cast aside as old news and forgotten as soon as the results were announced in his victory speech president trump stated now its time for america to bind the wounds of division have to get together to all republicans and democrats and independents across this nation i say it is time for us to come together as one united people federal news services  par  only marginal effort has been made for political accountability for
