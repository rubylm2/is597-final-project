 clarke kim in recent years some librarians have found their way to the profession after completing doctoral education in another field of academic librarians with subject doctorates other than lis earned between  and   chose to pursue librarianship either during or a fter their phd studies lindquist  gilman  p  although the fields of study varied doctoral degrees earned prior to librarianship still skew s ignificantly toward the arts and humanities  trailed by p rofessionsapplied sciences  social sciences  and natural sciences  pp  while we acknowledge that differences exist across various library settings making the data from these previous studies seem disparate all librarians are required to complete the same masters level degree as p rofessional qualification regardless of what type of library academic public school etc they find themselves working in while some librarians have specific goals regarding organizational placement other librarians may change from one library type to another eg academic to public in the course of their career the data reviewed here from these historical studies offer a broad picture of librarianship at large methods studies throughout the past  years clearly show librarians skewing heavily toward backgrounds in english the humanities and social s ciences but contemporary librarianship is increasingly emphasizing support for stem fields in library activities such as teaching information literacy c ollection development outreach research and publishing gubnitskaia  smallwood  mardis  outreach and other instructional endeavors such as the big orange stem saturday at the university of knoxville tennessee have increased in popularity and offerings flash allen mack  clement  scientific focused information literacy instruction is increasingly incorporated into academic curricula and requires the support of academic librarians scaramozzino   laherty  emphasizes the need for librarians to incorporate information literacy into science education programs to be competent in the theories pedagogies and standards of scientific fields but academic libraries are not the only libraries emphasizing stem learning stem activities and programs such as science fairs non fiction book clubs and other programming strategies are popular in public l ibraries as are d isplays reading lists and other readers advisory services promoting stem topics hopwood  myers spencer  huss  r oberson  school l ibraries support stem curriculum through s imilar techniques duff  lamb  as contemporary librarianship increases support for stem fields one might think that the backgrounds of librarians might also be shifting in this direction is this truly the case what actually c omprises the educational and disciplinary backgrounds of contemporary librarians in what ways if any do contemporary librarians
the more things change the more they stay the same  educational and disciplinary backgrounds differ from those of the past or from the general population at large to ensure the most current and up to date information for this study contemporary librarians were considered those on the cusp of their library careersthat is current and recent masters level students in librarianship over the previous five years  although previously the alise annual report included data about prior areas of study the organization discontinued collecting undergraduate major data in  saye  lan  p  instead anonymous de identified data about matriculated students year of enrollment previous undergraduate and graduate degrees and the areas of study for those degrees were solicited from every ala accredited masters programs in the united states canada and puerto rico see appendix a for the letter soliciting participation although many of the previous studies reviewed above solicited data via survey questionnaires this form of data collection was chosen over a survey in an attempt to collect a more thorough and representative set of data not reliant on individual personal responses requests for data were sent in january  to the  institutions with ala accredited masters degree programs of these seven institutions in the united states  agreed to provide program data for the study thirty additional institutions  responded but opted not to p articipate while reasons for non participation varied most reflected the unavailability of the data in a readily sharable format andor the labor intensive nature of data collection and the programs inability to devote staff time or resources to the task the requests stated a preference for de identified data but also stated that special arrangements could be made to collect identifiable data while still protecting students information an offer extended after consultation with syracuse universitys institutional review board despite the assurance of irb compliance several institutions declined to participate because of concerns over student privacy with one institution going so far as to seek counsel on the matter from their legal department before declining to participate to encourage participation in the study data were collected in whatever format was most convenient for the institution resulting in a variety of formats from spreadsheets to simple lists the data were standardized and aggregated and then coded based on a scheme developed during a pilot study with admission data from the university of washington clarke b the coding scheme was revised and expanded to accommodate the data from additional schools see appendix b for the full coding scheme every degree subject was normalized for example degrees listed with subjects in classics classical studies and classical civilization were all s ynonymized to classics in addition every normalized subject was hierarchically classified under a broader discipline code eg h istory was classified as a humanities discipline although many subjects are well r ecognized as falling into certain disciplinary categories some
 clarke kim classifications especially for new and emerging subjects proved challenging whenever possible we investigated the subjects and degrees and attempted to represent their actual nature if the degree granting institution was known we examined web pages and other information about the degree to determine which discipline might be appropriate we consulted established classifications and definitions such as the national endowment for the humanities to guide our classification when subject and disciplinary classification was complete descriptive statistics were used to understand the landscape of educational backgrounds in contemporary librarianship as well as to compare with historical data after presenting preliminary results at the american library associations annual conference clarke  we also coded every undergraduate degree a second time based on the ipeds classification of instructional programs taxonomic scheme national center for education statistics nces nd b based on external feedback and suggestions this allowed us to compare the distribution of subjects among librarians undergraduate degrees with that of undergraduate degrees in the american population at large results and discussion current overall educational and disciplinary profile of contemporary american librarians based on the data from seven institutions with ala accredited masters programs it is clear that contemporary librarians predominantly hail from disciplinary backgrounds in the humanities with  of previous degrees having been awarded in this discipline this is followed by the social sciences  the professions  stem  the arts  and miscellaneousinterdisciplinary studies  see figure  figure  disciplinary backgrounds of contemporary librarians
the more things change the more they stay the same  in addition to examining the overarching disciplinary divisions we also tabulated counts for specific areas of study eg the major or topic of study of each degree the predominant areas of study reflected in previous degrees held by matriculating mlis students also emphasizes subjects in the humanities with english and history topping the list see table  these subjects rose to the top even without including counts for table  top  degree subjects across all lis programs number of degrees percentage of all degree subject awarded degrees awarded humanities english   humanities history   professions education   social sciences cultural studies   social sciences psychology   humanities english english literature   humanities languages   social sciences political science   professions lis   humanities art history theory  criticism   social sciences anthropology   humanities religious studies   professions law   social sciences communication   social sciences economics   stem computer sciences   professions business administration   social sciences sociology   social sciences journalismmass communication   professions information sciences   stem engineering electrical engineering   humanities english creative writing   miscellaneous interdisciplinary   humanities philosophy   art othergeneralmiscellaneous  
 clarke kim more specific topics in those areas such as english literature th most common art history th or creative writing nd degrees in education were the third most common but they represent a very distant third place compared to the top two subjects while this table reflects the subjects of previous degrees earned by matriculated masters students it does not delineate the levels of those degrees some students entered into a masters level library education program with only a single undergraduate degree while others entered with an undergraduate degree as well as a masters degree or some other combination of degrees eg multiple bachelors andor masters degrees associate degrees law degrees doctoral degrees etc no attempt was made to distinguish the level of education a student received based on the level of degree that is no assumption was made that a graduate degree conferred more expertise or education in a particular subject than an undergraduate degree only the subjects were noted a total of  students recorded  degrees giving an average of  degrees per student current undergraduate educational and disciplinary backgrounds while all entering mlis students are required to have earned an undergraduate degree not all have earned additional graduate or other degrees including all degrees as we did above offers a holistic picture of focus of study by discipline but it also may skew the results toward subjects in which additional degrees were earned it also makes comparisons with other data sets both historical and contemporary more difficult for instance based on the above data humanistic disciplines seem to be overrepresented in librarianship but perhaps humanistic courses of study are popular across the board not just in librarianship to determine whether the undergraduate degree subjects of librarians differ from the population at large we compared the subjects of the undergraduate degrees in our data set to national data from the us department of educations integrated postsecondary education data system ipeds ipeds is a system of annual surveys conducted by the national center for educational statistics every college university and technical and vocational institution that participates in federal student financial aid programs is required to self report numerous pieces of institutional data including data related to institutional characteristics and prices admissions measures of enrollment and access and degrees conferred among others nces nd a we took several steps to prepare our study data for comparison with national data from ipeds first all non undergraduate degrees were removed from our data set as ipeds collects only data relating to postsecondary non graduate studies next each degree from our original coding scheme was checked against the ipeds classification of instructional programs cip searchable site nces nd b in order to crosswalk our data

 clarke kim information science alongside computer science in the ipeds classification mlis s tudents often have undergraduate degrees in library and information science lis this could also be due to data from programs offering a broader graduate level degree in information with tracks or specializations for lis computer science information management user experience ux and other cognate fields ipeds does offer a separate category specifically for library science and that is where we classified undergraduate lis degrees from our dataset however other non library i nformation related degrees such as information administration and management were assigned to the ipeds category of computer and i nformation sciences computer science degrees may also be more highly represented due to the types of mlis programs that responded several contemporary degree programs now admit students to a general information based course of study where students subsequently may select to p ursue a specialization or track in library science and librarianship therefore some degrees in our dataset surely represent matriculated students who went on to pursue information degrees exclusive of the mlis a similar issue arises in the area of law at least one of the mlis p rograms that contributed data offered a specialization in law librarianship thus attracting people with previous experience in that area although this may not be evident in the undergraduate data  in librarianship compared with  overall  of all previous degrees undergraduate graduate and post graduate earned by incoming mlis students were in law this likely reflects the fact that the juris doctor jd a degree earned only after already earning an undergraduate degree is considered the first degree in law in the united states law school admission council nd surprisingly the percentage of mlis students with undergraduate degrees in mathematics and statistics is nearly identical to the overall rate  in librarianship vs  overall the only other categories with similar distributions were architecture communicationsjournalism and multiinterdisciplinary studies how this profile compares to previous studies librarianship clearly reflects a different distribution of undergraduate degrees than the us population at large to investigate whether this d istribution is a new trend reflecting contemporary needs or has remained constant over time we compared undergraduate degree data from our dataset to similar data reported on in previous studies see figure  data from douglass  white  macklin  and cain  were used for this comparison as they all offered a similar level of specificity to the ipeds classification of undergraduate majors two of the studies gleaned data from questionnaire responses of undergraduate students douglass white  macklin while cain relied on data from the vita bank an attempted census of practicing librarians not all subject
the more things change the more they stay the same  figure  undergraduate degrees across four studies designations were reflected in each study notably white and macklin did not specifically report library science business or arts undergraduate degrees as individual categories totals do not add up to  due to additional subject area designations not consistently reported across all four studies as well as accounting for othermiscellaneous degrees it should be noted as per the previous discussion of ipeds classification history is categorized as a social science rather than part of the humanities despite still comprising a near majority earning an undergraduate humanities degree prior to librarianship appears to be on the decline social sciences are represented in higher numbers in more recent years although this could be attributed to a number of reasons the classification of history as a social science certainly affects these results in a significant way but a higher number of social science undergraduates pursuing librarianship could also correspond with the evolutionary alignment of librarianship to information science which is often positioned as a social science or perhaps more options for social science degrees have become available in recent years some professions such as education library science and business were identified individually in most of the studies while other professions determined by our own original inductive coding were not again this may be an artifact of an evolving education space which now includes degrees in subjects that were previously not offered in the academy of the specific professions highlighted in three of the four studies compared here education seems to have peaked in the s and declined since then although librarianship is still often affiliated with an educational bent e specially when considering its historical foundations and core values a decline
 clarke kim in this focus has been noted as a result of the fields alignment with information science dali  when compared with the contemporary ipeds data librarianship actually slightly lags the nation in undergraduate education degrees  nationally vs  in librarianship business on the other hand has seen a slight rise from  of undergraduate degrees in  to  today but as previously noted this is starkly out of proportion with the national figure of  interestingly enough degrees in the visual and performing arts appear to be on the rise perhaps due to graduates of those degrees facing increased challenges in securing jobs in fields directly related to their studies implications and conclusions this work set out to investigate the educational and disciplinary backgrounds of contemporary librarians as well as to understand how these backgrounds compare to librarians of the past as well as to the g eneral population unsurprisingly we found that contemporary librarians represented by mlis students on the cusp of their career so as to reflect the future landscape as much as possible still hail predominantly from humanities backgrounds especially english history is also a strongly represented area of study the large number of people with humanities backgrounds may have made sense when libraries were focused on books literature and reading however by the time library education shifted to the graduate level in the united states librarianship itself had also already begun the shift toward becoming the social science field it is considered today yet the undergraduate backgrounds of people pursuing librarianship do not seem to have shifted at the same rate this leaves library educators with the difficult task of training people with humanities backgrounds to do social science worka fundamentally different approach that risks mismatches in disciplinary norms while most students with humanities backgrounds are more than capable writers their unfamiliarity with the research methodologies and genre conventions often found in mlis curricula which is more closely aligned with the social sciences leaves many of these students struggling to understand expectations mandel  p  reports that this same skill set is especially valuable in post mlis employment where the ability of library and information professionals to responsibly consume and competently produce research is critical to the growth of the field and to the way other disciplines view lis this is true for academic librarians who may be required to engage in primary research as part of their tenure obligations and for librarians in the field in general who are increasingly called upon to demonstrate the value and impact of their work through evidence based practice o akleaf  p  the backgrounds of librarians are quite different from those of the college educated american populace at large where  of adults aged  and older have bachelors degrees or more ryan  bauman  with
the more things change the more they stay the same  especially noticeable differences in business and health fields as evidenced in the most recently available ipeds data additional emphases on stem in american society along with calls for increased research resources and education in these fields point to the need for librarians to support these services but the small number of people with stem backgrounds going into librarianship leaves a disconnect for future librarians to serve patrons in these areas mlis programs must recruit more people with undergraduate education in such fields andor integrate education about services for these populations into graduate level library education curricula we are not claiming that stem librarians who have an undergraduate background in the humanities or social sciences are unqualified and unable to fulfill their professional duties only positing that an increase in the number of librarians with stem undergraduate education can help serve the professions increased need for stem support and contribute to more diverse perspectives in mlis education although they still represent a small percentage overall librarians with undergraduate education in the fine and creative arts are increasing in number while the needs in these fields are perhaps not as concrete as the needs in stem fields people with arts backgrounds may be able to offer some of the skills necessary for twenty first century librarianship such as creativity flexibility innovation and risk taking bertot et al  undergraduate art education especially the studio arts explicitly offers instruction that f osters creativity clarke  cripps  undergraduate studio art education includes learning how to take risks view topics from multiple and flexible points of view and appreciate various perspectives salazar  innovationeven in scientific fieldshas long been linked with creative pursuits like the arts for example gurnon voss andrae and stanley  show how including visual arts in the undergraduate science curriculum can help develop scientific imagination such integration u nderlies the revision of stem to steam science t echnology engineering arts and mathematics a movement encouraging the i nclusion of art and design as integral aspects of stem rhode island school of design  although skills derived from art and design are certainly used by librarians clarkes a historical research shows that they have been implicit and underdeveloped in american librarianship and have yet to be explicitly taught in library education given the argument that library work is actually more aligned with the discipline of design than of social sciences clarke a  people with art and design backgrounds may be better equipped with the creative skills necessary for twenty first century library careers yet until mlis education embraces a design approach these students may find themselves trapped in similar p atterns to those mentioned for humanities students above and may risk being unable to apply the skills learned in their design educations to librarianship these findings may be useful but like all studies of this nature they are not without flaws despite our attempt to collect census data from all
