fifty one years ago when i was a freshman in college i went into the wildcat inn the equivalent of a student union building on most majority culture campuses and was surprised by the excitement of students hovered around the local newspaper the reason they were excited was that they had just read the headline on the front page russia launches the first satellite the satellite was called sputnik the russian word for satellite sputnik was the first artificial satellite to be put into outer spaceit launched on october  and much to americas chagrin russia had won the race to space those of you born in the latter part of the twentieth century may not realize the implications of russias accomplishment in  the united states and russia were in the midst of the cold war and russias indication of technological superiority over the united states was quite disconcerting the reputation the united states had sustained as the most progressive nation in the world was shattered even though the united states launched the explorer  just a few months later in early  it would always be remembered by all nations of the world that the united states came in second to russia in the increasingly important space race the united states was humiliated no longer would the world deem america as the superior nation in science and technology how could a country where the majority of the population had only learned to read and write in the last fifty years outdo the united states the most innovative country in the world i will explain how in  the allies allocated berlin to russia russia seized german scientists and displaced jewish intellectuals by the thousands as did the western allies it also seized countries from the baltic to the adriatic creating what winston churchill deemed the iron curtain that divided europe into two distinct regions behind the iron curtain russia abducted and exploited the brilliant minds of these diverse peoples russia had acquired its own talent pool representing the brightest and best minds in europe russias edge over the united states in the race to space boiled down to one advantage the advantage of a diverse talent pool the advantage of harnessed diversity this advantage always leads to success the loss of this first race to space caused us leaders to take a long hard look at our own scientists although the united states had abducted some german scientists we realized that the only way to truly harness diversity was to expand our educational system to include all races and cultures living in the united states although russia used its ill gotten talent pool to its advantage in the beginning it made the mistake of trying to force its diverse cultures into the mold of the soviet culture instead of celebrating differences it tried to produce a single soviet puree a concoction of soviet minded robots where everyone was forced to conform to a single set of cultural beliefs and practices on the other hand america made the first steps toward accentuating and capitalizing on differences among its people america strived for a tossed salad america decided to implement the change to create a colorful yet distinctive nation of people in the tossed salad of society the separate components create a salad representing our nation as a whole america determined to provide educational opportunities for all its citizens by focusing on the importance of diversity and inclusiveness diversity includes gender ethnicity religion cultural background sexual orientation age and disabilities the successful rocket launch of the sputnik forced americans to self assess and question american education and its scientific technical and industrial strength in  congress increased the national science foundations nsf appropriation by nearly  million as compared to the year before by  the nsf budget was nearly  millionthis was money allocated to promote the progress of science to advance the national health prosperity and welfare to secure the national defense monies were used to promote inclusiveness which is the embracing and harnessing of a diverse talent pool as a result of this harnessed diversity the united states beat the
