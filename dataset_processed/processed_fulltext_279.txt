world documentation congress paris   left five dead and  wounded further disturbances were followed by more strikes and a deepening depression the year  however was not in itself a particularly dramatic year either for france or for the world rather it was just another year in that eventful decade during which helplessly it seemed international order disintegrated into war yet in the spiritual life of the nations there welled up irresistibly still a longing for peace a hope of renewal in national and international institutions a vision of civilization at once enlarged and refined through the growth and sharing of knowledge an indomitable if ultimately impotent faith in the power of the intellect in the necessity of international association in the inescapable reality of mankind interdependence thus it was that an exposition held in paris in  to unite the nations in peace and to celebrate the progress of art and science  p  could attract some  million persons  p  thus too a world congress of universal documentation convened on the occasion of the exposition supported by the league of nations organization for international intellectual cooperation and bringing together  persons including the official representatives of governments and international associations  p  was not inevitably an absurdity the international exhibition forty four governments responded to the french request to participate in the exposition a record number it was claimed  p  the date of the opening of the exposition by albert lebrun president of the french republic had originally been set for march   the industrial disturbances and financial crisis that racked the country at the beginning of the year forced a three week postponement  p  an even longer delay occurred in completing the arrangements in the right wing of the trocadero for the exhibits associated with class ii of the exposition libraries and literary phenomena  for class ii to be an appropriate part of that premier group of exhibition classes that centered on questions of the intellect scientific discovery radio and the cinema many of which had separate pavilions and received considerable public attention julien cain administrator general of the bibliotheque nationale and president of class ii hoped to achieve something more than a museum of rare and costly books he observed that written printed bound illustrated a book ends up in a public or private library  in keeping with the theme of the exposition what was needed was a palace for literature the book and graphic arts and crafts part of the exhibition to be mounted there would be dedicated to professional
 the library quarterly librarianship developing the exhibits and arranging them in the trocadero were not completed until the end of july there were four major parts of what was known as the library exhibit first an actual library was set up with shelves along one wall the collection divided by broad subject classes various kinds of tables and chairs provided for readers a second part dealt with individual libraries in france and around the world here photographs and plans were used to create murals or were mounted in large movable panels which were hinged together at the wall at waist level to form what one might call display codices a third section was dedicated to matters of professional librarianship here the displays dealt among other things with the creation of various kinds of catalogs a number of professional associations and examples of what today are called library outreach activities to hospitals and other agencies finally there was a section dealing with library equipment and machinery in an upstairs gallery was set out a selection of wooden furniture for various library purposes in the main hall there were models of french and german book conveyer systems a french engineer exhibited a new apparatus for the disinfection and sterilization of books by means of a blade shaped bacteria destroying gaseous jet of formic aldehyde acting in an enclosed circuit  p  in addition to these exhibits were two stands devoted to microphotography one showed equipment in use in the bibliotheque nationale this consisted of one of six exemplars of a camera constructed in paris in a small shop near the pasteur institute the camera was designed by atherton seidell at that time a professor in the national institutes of health in washington and l de saint rat  the other stand was much more interesting it contained two cameras and a complete laboratory for processing film what set this exhibit apart was that the cameras and laboratory were in continuous operation on a major microphotographic copying project during the entire exhibition the stand was an american one the equipment was provided by the university of chicago which also lent a member of its staff to organize and carry out the whole project this is how herman h fussler twenty three years old happened to be in paris in the spring of  the american microphotographic exhibit the exhibit over which herman fussler presided in paris had taken nearly two years of discussion to bring to fruition the initial suggestion had resulted from an invitation extended to the american national committee on intellectual cooperation by the international institute of intellectual cooperation the executive arm of the league of nations
world documentation congress paris   organization for intellectual cooperation m llewellyn raney director of the university of chicago libraries expressed the thinking that lay behind this invitation thus what the world needs above all is to work together people in intellectual pursuits should lead the way what better place for a demonstration than an international exposition so why not set aside a great hall assign each nation its sector and have all in their several ways bend ingenuity to visualizing the gain of displacing rivalry with dovetailed effort for the common good  p  the american committee decided that microphotography was an appropriate subject for an exhibit for an occasion like the exposition as fussler remarked it was logically suggested that microphotography offered more hope of practical international intellectual cooperation than any other medium in the manner in which it could make the exchange of documents practical  p  microphotography had only recently become a subject of interest to the american scholarly and bibliographic community but in some circles that interest had become ardent the national archives was exploring its use for the preservation of documents the function of microphotography in the publication of research materials was being studied by a joint committee on materials for research of the american council of learned societies and the national research council the chairman of the joint committee also a member of the american national committee on intellectual cooperation was robert c binkley who was closely allied in their mutual interest in microphotography with watson davis the director of science service an agency for the popularization of science davis had created a documentation division within science service in  to explore the role of microphotography in enhancing scientific communication and in the absence of any effective commercial interest in such developments actually to sponsor the design and construction of improved microfilm equipment an experimental microfilm interlibrary loan service the bibliofilm service had been set up in  in the united states department of agriculture library the camera used in this service the management of which was taken over by the documentation division of science service in  had been designed by rupert h draeger a lieutenant in the us navy who had been working closely with davis the american library association involvement with microphotography for library uses in its turn was formalized in a committee on photographic reproduction of library materials of which raney was chairman the committee was created in  and sponsored the publication of thejournal of documentary reproduction the first issue of which appeared in the spring of  raney wished to create at chicago a microphotographic laboratory of which a small machine shop would be a component where experimental
 the library quarterly equipment could be built used and modified as necessary both for filming and for the completely mechanized continuous processing of exposed film  p  it was perhaps not unexpected that given raney activities and the high national profile that they had brought him in november  after a long period of discussion the university of chicago should be asked formally by the american national committee on intellectual cooperation to implement the microfilm exhibit idea lending staff and apparatus framing the budget and conducting all negotiations  p  to make the exhibit worthwhile it was decided that it was necessary to find cameras that could accommodate high reduction ratios and long footages all the camera operations would need to be so coordinated in construction as to respond to a single light impulse and thus leave nothing to the human agent after the initial adjustment except pressure of button and turn of pages it was also necessary to find similarly mechanized processing equipment to handle developing fixing and drying  p  above all it was also agreed that the game was not worth the candle if apparatus were merely to be set up and looked at it must be a going concern  p  for this to be possible special arrangements were necessary in paris a location had to be found at the exposition where a laboratory could be set up with a darkroom filtered running water electric power and temperature control the laboratory would need to be both secure to protect the equipment and the materials being filmed yet accessible to passersby moreover for the project to make sense it was necessary to film materials that were important and for this special cooperation from french libraries especially the bibliotheque nationale would be necessary the details of this formidable program were in fact fairly quickly worked out it was decided to microfilm french revolutionary journals and as far as possible such important long running periodicals as le journal des debats or le temps or those titles or segments that were not held in the united states by any library the rockefeller foundation agreed to provide funds to support the project contracts were let for an automatic processor that would receive rolls of film from a camera at one end and deliver them ready for use at the other and for a photorecord camera that would illustrate portability with the maximum of mechanization then possible  p  arrangements were also made with the navy for lieutenant draeger to construct one of his cameras intended for high volume newspaper work for the project this involved obtaining permission from the secretary of the navy and the postponement of a trip already planned for draeger to china to film documents for the library of congress he was instructed to go to paris for six months to work on the camera for the american exhibit and thus avoided the sack
world documentation congress paris   of beijing by the japanese the exposition officials at first arranged for the project to be set up in one of the buildings of the new musees drt moderne that had been erected especially for the exposition but as planning went forward for the library exhibit under the guidance of julien cain it was decided to locate the american project in the trocadero it seemed appropriate at this point to seek to change the sponsorship of the american exhibit and this was passed from the american national committee on intellectual cooperation to the american library association raney made a quick trip to paris to survey conditions and to arrange the details for the loan from the bibliotheque nationale of the material to be filmed herman fussler and gladys fussler his wife who like him was a librarian with a library degree from the university of north carolina and who was to act as secretary and bibliographer for the project sailed for paris early in april  with them went crates containing recordak and optigraph reading machines lieutenant draeger camera still in the process of construction the automatic filmprocessing machine and such miscellaneous equipment as would be necessary for the running of the equipment and darkroom as well as a substantially complete machine shop which draeger needed to finish his camera  p  in paris they conferred briefly with raney the workshop for draeger was housed in the maison de chimie where the other equipment was set up until work on the trocadro was completed the delay in the opening of the library exhibit in the trocadero was welcomed by the fusslers the new specially designed equipment for the exhibit had not arrived in chicago in time to be tested in paris after the long seajourney it needed both to undergo repair and to be adapted for installation in the trocadero in fact the delay in completing the draeger camera was so great that it was in operation only for the final month of the project problems with the bearings in the automatic filmprocessing equipment plagued the operation throughout contrary to specifications the balls in the bearings were of brass and were corroded by the chemical baths it proved impossible to secure them in stainless steel in appropriate sizes in paris so they had to be continually replaced despite these and a variety of other problems the exhibit was a huge success each day or so gladys fussler brought materials in a taxi from the bibliotheque nationale by the end of the project over  pages had been copied in full view of passersby the positive film copies were made available to any library that wished to order them reading machines adjacent to the cameras were constantly used by interested spectators important groups and individuals studied the work the president of the republic was one the comite international des bibliotheques the executive body of the still fledging lnternational federation
 the library quarterly of library associations and the world congress of universal documentation were given special demonstrations on the occasion of the visit of the world congress of universal documentation the library exhibit wing of the trocadero was closed to the public and the bibliothique nationale gave a luncheon for the delegates gathered just beyond the counter of the american exhibit in the award of exhibition honors for class ii the american library association and the university of chicago were both given a grand prix gold medals went to draeger and the companies that had constructed the equipment and a silver medal to herman fussler as a co operator the world documentation congress the idea of documentation as a field of study and a professional occupation originated in the work of paul otlet and his colleagues in brussels they had founded the international institute of bibliography iib in  and under its auspices had begun to compile a universal bibliographic repertory the universal decimal classification derived from the dewey decimal classification but modified in a number of ways was elaborated over a period of ten years or so and was used to provide subject access to the repertory during this period and later in a series of seminal papers for example   otlet developed his conception of bibliography into what he called documentation he wanted to go beyond books journals catalogs and libraries to embrace in a new system of organization with new and sophisticated modes of intellectual access all documents whatever their format that contributed to our knowledge and understanding he hoped to find ways of transforming the universal catalog ceaselessly proliferating during those years into what he called a universal documentary encyclopedia for this to be successfully accomplished practically a universal network for documentation was needed and theoretically a fuller understanding of the nature and the interaction of the parts and processes of documentation was also necessary very early otlet envisaged an important role for microphotography in his various documentary schemes  and he was to come back again to its potential for improving scholarly communication  later he was to speculate about the interconnections of the radio and cinema and even of television in the organization and dissemination of knowledge  in  the international institute of bibliography changed its name to become the international institute of documentation iid to reflect its more general interests when the league of nations created a committee on intellectual cooperation in  one of the first subcommittees it set up was to study
world documentation congress paris   questions of bibliography the committee attempted to come to an arrangement with the iib to coordinate their bibliographical interests and work eventually a formal agreement was signed between the two organizations although the agreement was never actually implemented to any degree in  when an executive arm of the league committee the international institute for intellectual cooperation iiic was founded in paris relations between the two institutes because of personality conflicts and ideological differences  pp     degenerated to such a degree that for a number of years little productive contact occurred between them the interest of the league of nations organization for intellectual cooperation in documentation was rekindled however in  when jean gerard presented a report on the union frantaise des offices de documentation ufod to the league committee of library experts then meeting in paris gerard administrator general of the maison de chimie in paris was largely responsible for the creation of ufod which had been organized during  and had been elected its president the discussion provoked in the committee of library experts by gerard report on ufod on the one hand brought to light the urgent need of encouraging new connections established between documentation centres in the same country and on the other hand set forth how desirable it would be for the international institute for intellectual cooperation to draw upon the basis of suggestions made during the discussion the documents that had already been subbmitted and the requests received during the year a memorandum to be submitted as soon as possible to the principal national centres already in existence in order to get their advice and suggestions the material thus compiled would be useful for subsequently drawing up a working programme dealing with the problem of documentation within the frame work of the organization for intellectual cooperation and in connection with already existing bodies  p  it became clear from a preliminary inquiry in  of documentation centers throughout the world and then a more formal survey in  that the first requirement    was that of an international guide to documentary information services clearly indicating the scope and object of documentation as well as mechanism sic for rationalization such a work it is considered would greatly facilitate the organization of a universal and rational system of documentation   p  a meeting of experts in paris in november  examined a scheme proposed by grard for such a guide eventually in july  a voluminous draft guide international de documentation was submitted for discussion and comment to the committee on intellectual cooperation and to the fortieth anniversary congress of the international institute of documentation meeting in copenhagen the result must have been some
 the library quarterly thing of a shock so strong were the misunderstandings and the opposition provoked by the draft guide that nothing the iiic could do was able to reconcile the different points of view and win general acceptance  p  the disagreements and conflicts over the guide were partly an expression of deep seated problems in the iid in the early s it was torn by a struggle for a succession of leadership and for organizational reform younger men were questioning and ultimately repudiated the philosophical underpinnings for its work that otlet had propounded after  the influence in the government of the lid of otlet and la fontaine the cofounders was very much curtailed though it was not until  that elevated to the ceremonial office of honorary vicepresidents they ceased to be secretaries general nevertheless otlet was an articulate figure of considerable eminence and there were many whom he had inspired professionally and who also offered him considerable loyalty thus his opinions about many of the changes that were occurring and his distress were not without effect at issue was a range of intricate difficult problems the place of the universal bibliographic repertory in the work of the iid the place of the institute itself in the complex of organizations otlet and la fontaine had created in brussels and called mundaneum the relationship of the institute to the international office of bibliography originally a headquarters for the institute and partly subsidized by the belgian government who owned the copyright to the universal decimal classification to these issues jean gerard separately in papers to meetings of the iid conferences and through his influence on the work for documentation of the iiic had inevitably added others he had particular ideas about the national organization as expressed in ufod that was needed to advance the cause of documentation he also argued for the creation of an international union for documentation both gerard and the preliminary league documents showed ignorance of some of the achievements and the recent changes in the iid they appeared in some respects to be suggesting competing or at least alternative organizational possibilities thus to the internal conflicts were added external complications that further divided the iid and created the appearance of insoluble problems outside it the iiic guide international de documentation in  simply provided a focus for the passions that over a period of several years had gathered around a number of organizational and technical matters of documentation the world congress of universal documentation then was potentially an ideal form for identifying and perhaps defusing some of these curiously divisive issues indeed in the institute for intellectual cooperation journal the congress was described as representing an assembly of
world documentation congress paris   a kind of estates general of documentation meeting in conditions of absolute independence and autonomy  p  the occasion of the paris exposition was thought to be particularly felicitous for such a congress as jean gerard president of the congress organizing committee remarked the promoters of the international exposition of art and technology wanted its program to encompass whatever dealt with the expression of thought the conservation of knowledge and the diffusion of understanding a congress like ours could not find a more appropriate occasion    documentation is the basis of intellectual production it is in all areas one of the principal instruments of international cooperation  p  representatives of thirty one governments and of forty eight international organizations were among the  delegates who assembled for the congress in the rooms of the centre marcelin berthelot in the maison de chimie the official american delegation to the congress consisted of seven persons among their number were herman fussler douglas waples professor in the university of chicago graduate library school and watson davis director of science service in washington and head of the delegation the conference papers were issued as a preliminary volume of communications in order to serve as the basis for discussion at the conference which met in plenary sessions rupert draeger and atherton seidell presented papers describing the microfilm cameras they had designed seidell also discussed the use of microfilm in the compilation of voluminous scientific data watson davis paper was a brief account of the american documentation institute which had been organized in july  as an independent body to take over the functions of the documentation division of science service herman fussler examined recent progress in microphotography in the united states as it proceeded the congress seemed to have three major aspects technical discussions the discussions about a world network for documentation and the inspiring presence of watson davis h g wells and paul otlet the technical discussions were not very extensive and are now of little interest they dealt with the use of documentation equipment problems of conservation and so on reflecting the interests of watson davis who introduced the resolution the congress recommended that libraries and organizations of documentation should unite in a world net of microfilm bibliofilm services preserving individual operation but utilizating such uniform methods order forms prices etc as to facilitate interchange of requests and that such cooperation be organized through a national center in each country  p  by and large however the american delegation took little or no part in the discussions of the conference as reflected in the compte rendu though the
 the library quarterly contents of the american papers were summarized at the session on equipment and tools on the afternoon of thursday august  there can be no doubt that the underlying purpose of the conference was to resolve the difficulties that had occurred internationally in the organization of documentation to define appropriate forms of national participation in a worldwide system of documentation  p  and as a result to determine what would become of the iid the discussion on these issues which consumed all of friday the th of august seems to have been surprisingly frank given the nature of the occasion the inadequacies of the iid organizationally and in terms of what it conceived its work to be were commented on critically it was resolved for example to ask the international commission for universal classification of the iid to develop in an objective spirit the work it has already undertaken on the different classifications and on the theory and the general principles of classification by securing a larger participation of organizations and personalities concerned with these problems     p  when the president of the iid j alingh prins from holland indicated that the iid as presently constituted fulfilled the desiderata for an international organization for documentation under discussion he was in effect contradicted by jean gerard geard observed that the establishment of a network is not a question of statutes but of facts  p  gerard referred to the draft statutes for an international union for documentation that otlet had elaborated and which had been adopted but never implemented in  by the international research council in grard view the lid fell far short of what he had proposed himself and what had been proposed then after a solemn polling of the nations and having been assured by its officers that the iid would accept its proposals the congress formally invited the iid to transform itself into an international federation for documentation and to make other modifications in its statutes to give effect to the congress resolutions in retrospect the congress was given a special quality by the presence of three men who could not have been more unlike watson davis was a relatively young brash entrepreneurial american h g wells the english novelist and social theorist was world renowned but his voice raised in warning of the perils of the time was no longer heeded and finally there was paul otlet white haired white bearded peering through small wire rimmed glasses bringing with him the whole history of the european documentation movement davis was consumed by a vision of the possibilities that microfilm presented in his address as leader of the american delegation at the opening session of the congress he said i conceive that it is our purpose meeting here to bolster protect and set up very practical chan

 the library quarterly tion he had created was now moving away from him his thinking as expressed in his public writings had become ever more abstract theoretical and unconcerned with practical issues of personality and organization in the communications of the congress is the text of a paper which he hoped would serve as a basis for its discussions  it is typical of his writings at this time a general discussion of documentation its  pages are divided into  numbered parts each part is further subdivided into numbered sections each section in its turn divided still further by letters of the alphabet the first part defines documentation other parts deal with new forms of documents photographs films discs he moves to a discussion of synthesis in scientific thought and to the idea of a new form of encyclopedia the last is a subject with which he had been concerned throughout his life wells merely recapitulated in a way otlet own ideas about this he discusses documentation in relation to museums and the objects they contain and he moves from organisms of documentation to world organization to a universal network for documentation unlike wells and davis otlet is no longer making a case for something arguing a point seeking to explain and convince he is interested in setting out in a carefully developed arrangement all of the elements the components of a complex situation to flesh out briefly an encyclopedic schema to prepare almost an entry for the new encyclopedia which he had attempted to envisage such men as davis wells and otlet in their different ways were visionary that the world congress of universal documentation brought them together makes understandable the observation that was made following the banquet at which wells spoke in parting company the participants unanimously declared that this congress marked one of the most important steps in the history of documentation  p  conclusion the exposition of paris and the world congress of documentation are in fact of limited importance they did not prevent war they were not so splendid or their results so far reaching that they serve as points of reference when later expositions and congresses are discussed in the history of documentation despite the enthusiasm of the congress participants they constituted merely a not uninteresting event what they represented was the ongoing struggle of men to share knowledge to resolve differences especially in the modern world to harness technology for the improvement of social conditions and international relations no stage or moment of this struggle can be fully ignored at the exposition and congress a new technology along with possibilities of new
