a service learning framework to support an mlis core curriculum   the context for this study is part of an ongoing award winning service learning project developed and administered at the school of library and information studies sls university of alabama intended to increase the basic technology literacy of persons with intellectual disabilities this training model has potential as a framework for service learning within lis programs for future library professionals to meet the needs of the communities that they serve objective the primary research goal of this study is to demonstrate how such projects can systematically complement the core of an mlis curriculum and provide a generalizable project framework for the design and implementation of future projects that can benefit the mlis program at the university of alabama and elsewhere the perceived benefit of using a technology literacy or training based service learning context within lis education is based on the potential for connecting and supplementing a variety of lessons from core courses into a single outside experience developing an ability to create direct links between theoretical knowledge and practical application this study strives to validate such potential along with the feasibility of developing and testing frameworks for a specific type of service learning project providing a foundation for other similar programs although this project is still rather nascent in terms of the training modules and analysis it is important to examine and evaluate questions about service learning and its progression to community engagement in lis education kazmer  furthermore it is equally important to assess promptly the efficacy of the project framework to determine whether it is serving as it was initially intended as preparation for emerging lis professionals to integrate learning acquired from mlis core courses in service learning leading to community engagement beyond academe literature review critical literacy theory central to the study of technology literacy are the theoretical frames that inform the perspectives of disempowerment of underrepresented groups who may be denied access the depth and richness of these theories provide students with a foundational understanding that can inform their eventual practice in engaging the populations they serve community engagement typically addresses inadequacies andor inequalities existing in access to goods and services for certain groups this lack of access translates into a deficit of skill sets necessary to enable members of those groups to succeed in the workplace and in society at large literacy is one of the most fundamental skill sets and technology literacy is especially consequential to achievement and prosperity in the twenty first century access to such literacy for non dominant groups comes partially through service learning projects and community engagement initiatives designed to address specific inadequacies lis students should have a heightened awareness of the needs of such groups and the ways those needs can be addressed critical literacy theory allows students to examine the hegemonic effects of language acquisition fluency and availability which may provide barriers to those for whom culturally dominant literacy and language practices are rendered unattainable hegemony is rooted in the linguistic dexterity and control of literacy practices of the dominant group maintaining bias against language and cultural practices of those groups not in power siegel  as diverse populations increase traditional materials and methods become less relevant for those whose heritage derives from other non dominant cultures and groups or whose cultural practices do not adhere to dominant cultural norms the centrality of information literacy cannot be underestimated as a context for

  journal of education for library and information science back concerning the relevant aspects of core mlis courses mostly aligns with the original intent of the project framework for example based on students feedback the module development and instructional tasks are supported by the information tools and services core area also the information technologies area of the mlis curriculum serves as a suitable foundation for the tasks that involve computing the research components of the project validate the relevance of the methods course and its applicability to the tasks that involve basic data collection and analysis both the lis socialization and information technology courses are particularly supportive of activities that involve project dissemination supporting the importance of technology literacy in the training of lis professionals moreover information dissemination requires an understanding of basic web development and web  technologies covered in the information technology course though not considered integral to the initial project framework this association proves to be a positive unintended consequence of this basic research in measuring the supportiveness of various core areas for project management students report an overall wider variety of core courses as being useful since students manage only one project task but participate in multiple tasks management courses are relevant to various phases of the project this supports the notion that collaboration and managerial ability are significant to the development of lis professionals brasley  in addition to the value of the management component in the slis core if even reported as supportive the course most relevant or closely aligned to a particular task is also associated with managing that particular area eg the student in charge of dissemination reports that the management information technology and socialization courses are supportive for managing that general area this supports the crucial management role of librarians in the st century matheson  because only eleven students have completed a full round of service thus far it is inappropriate to do much more in depth statistical analysis across the collected data however preliminary evaluation was important following the organizational stage of the project and deemed worthy of being reported the results of this project also provide evidence consistent with postmodern theorists who link theory to practice such that lis professionals adopt a worldview which integrates self society and knowledge this integrative approach develops students critical consciousness as they move into the profession as professionals they will be equipped with the tools to initiate foster and maintain community partnerships that will benefit communities as a whole and non dominant groups in particular these results also facilitate university and community partnerships which validate social capital and planning theory and information theory therefore the marriage of the theoretical foundations with the practical application of technology literacy proves relevant to the   st century lis profession as a potential hub of service learning and community engagement activities and research positioning this service learning framework as an integral part of an mlis curriculum provides students with the pedagogical outcomes of an lis program in service of professional librarianship and a worldview inclusive of critical theory applied to community engagement discussion and future work this project strives to provide technology literacy training for a specific population of individuals with intellectual disabilities while applying critical pedagogy to an mlis core curriculum this is a crucial task in lis engagement and society in general since every citizen should have the opportunity to reach his or her full potential and participate actively in the community the community service
a service learning framework to support an ml is core curriculum  component for this project is designed to provide access to technology and training geared toward personal empowerment and success while giving students a practical experience in designing and implementing notable engagement services and research the findings and observations from this round of analysis give confidence that the project framework can serve as a practical generalization for developing similar technology literacy engagement projects in other lis programs moreover the results collected from the survey tables currently support the design of the original project framework and its intent to associate general project tasks with relevant lessons across the core of an mlis curriculum these results were further supported by informal semi structured interviews which enabled students to enrich and validate their responses trainingand instruction based projects are common in libraries and it would be helpful for new efforts to have an evaluated framework to assist in organizing planning and developing their overall structure and general tasks without having to continuously recreate and flesh out these ideas from scratch having such a framework would enable the systematic design of projects that directly utilize knowledge that students gain from multiple courses in the mlis core not just one individual service oriented course with specific objectives currently no such framework exists that brings together multiple aspects of an lis curriculum into one service learning experience although this framework is intended specifically for basic technology literacy projects its application is not limited to situations involving this particular population this framework is intended for use in organizing projects that provide different types of training of varying degrees of difficulty to a number of different groups the authors hope that this project can serve as a motivation for others to develop their own library engagement and servicelearning projects that strive to bridge the digital divide for other co cultural populations what was reported here is not the full extent of data being collected for or as a result of this service learning project as the project moves into more advanced stages of design instruction and evaluation future studies will be conducted to report other findings additional data on student participation and assessments are currently being collected which will make it possible to analyze and report on other experiences not just those that pertain to the project framework and application of lessons from the mlis core this type of ongoing analysis involves collecting information being reported in reflection papers blog posts webpage updates weekly research meeting student journals etc in addition to continuation of the data collection technique presented in table  ultimately the objective for the theoretical study of a particular project framework is to enable educators to provide students with the most effective and relevant learning situation and guidance for the development of community partnerships it also provides a context for other educators to further develop models that can serve as prototypes for additional course development and refinement in training lis professionals it is especially imperative for library professionals as libraries serve entire communities to be aware of best practices and their theoretical foundations to provide needed services and tools to empower non dominant groups this study provides a platform from which to launch additional research in community engagement library centrality and lis education curriculum acknowledgements the authors of this paper wish to acknowledge the university of alabama for providing financial support and all of the student participants whose dedication made this effort successful and beneficial
