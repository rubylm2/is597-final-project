library architecture and buildings ralph e ellsworth rrhue end of an era in library architecture and building planning as l symbolized by the dedication of yale sterling library in  coincides with the introduction of the library quarterly although library architecture was not a subject for investigation in the early years of the graduate library school the same spirit that filled the library quarterly with new research also revolutionized thinking about library buildings when graduates of the graduate library school found themselves in positions at a time when new buildings were being planned if it can be said that the library quarterly symbolized a shift in interest from the purely bibliophilic aspects of librarianship to the use and users of libraries so the new spirit in library architecture shifted from a purely aesthetic approach to planning to one based primarily on the use and users of buildings it is almost impossible in the year  to project one self back into an honest presentation of the spirit of library planning in  to say that a library should be planned to house books and to permit readers to use them under conditions of maximum convenience seems trite in  it was not so in  one art critic summed up the situation as follows when messrs mckim mead and white lifted labrouste library of ste genevieve and set it down somewhat altered in transit opposite richardson trinity church in boston they may have expressed some modem idea or other but they did not create a building well adapted to the uses of a library nor did messrs carrere and hastings succeed any better with the new york public library which is a striking expression of the modem idea of conspicuous waste and a very poor one of the ineluctable fact that a library is a place in which to house books and to read theml architects planned libraries prior to  and their conception of their function was that the entire building and each part of it even the corridors was to be superlatively beautiful a work of art each room was to be a beautiful self sufficient gem since truth was beauty and vice versa the results would be truthful ie useful if they were beautiful and was not the library in each community the climactic monument to society faith in culture when the architect finished his work and the dedication was concluded the building was turned over to the librarian and it was up to him to make it serve the purposes of the library he might even comment in a low whisper as andrew keogh did at yale that the library was on the inside formerly when the librarian wrote up his building for the library journal his description was primarily architectural in nature the uses to which he proposed to put the building were seldom mentioned these statements sound today as though one were making fun of architects of the earlier period this is not i suzanne la follette art in america new york w w norton  co  pp   
library architecture and buildings  so times have changed today the librarian and a planning committee control the early stages of planning they write the program and lay down the description of the functions the building is to serve the architect task is to create a building that will perform the functions described in the program there are no limitations placed on the right of the architect to create beauty as long as the provision of beauty as such does not waste money or interfere with the desired operations of the building there were exceptions prior to  and there are now one might mention the university of illinois library erected in  and the sullivan memorial library of temple in  there were librarians prior to  who thought in the modern manner eg m l raney phineas windsor and joseph wheeler and there are some in office today who do not it is the general picture that is being discussed in this paper library architects prior to  worked in the same spirit as did other architects of the time there were no architects who designed only libraries furthermore the conception of library activities as held by librarians at that time offered architects no compelling mandate to build anything new or different and if librarians resented their subordinate and often nonexistent role in planning new buildings they registered their feelings in a manner so mild that hardly any architect was intimidated it simply would not have occurred to that generation of librarians to rise up and brazenly seize the planning reins and they did not although they sometimes won their way with subtle and winsome wiles and then there was joseph wheeler architects too now live by a new conception of their work form follows function now a tiresome cliche really did represent a new spirit in architecture in the  and  and today the best of the architects did begin in that period to follow the principle that beauty was achieved only when the structure performed the task for which it was designed and that the operations to be carried out in each building would somehow eventually determine the exterior shape and appearance of the building planning began with the inside not with a preconceived exterior shape and design or if the latter was essential as at princeton or the university of georgia the architect really tried to make the style fit the function thus far in the new spirit there has been no new library design that can be recognized as such except that the new buildings do not look like the old gothic libraries they tend to be boxlike with little superficial ornamentation the towers have gone ohio state university architect wanted one on the addition to that institution library but he was talked out of it by a committee in the smaller college and public libraries there has been a flowering of attractive buildings in many styles but almost all the large libraries are cubular the planning of new buildings took on a new aspect during world war ii when the co operative committee on library building plans was organized a group of strong minded and highly articulate librarians some of the country best architects and representatives of faculty library committees sat down to talk out the problems of planning libraries there was mutual respect on all three sides of the triangle
 the library quarterly and the brilliant cohesive leadership of dean john e burchard helped both architects and librarians extend their thinking beyond the old stereotypes and cliches this committee established new procedures wrote them out wound up its affairs and passed out of existence to be replaced by a series of institutes of the american library association for each type of library its new procedures consisted of the following steps  preparation of a statement of the library program by the librarian and the architect which was presented to the group for criticism  employment of a consultant to assist with expert advice at all stages of the planning and  preparation of preliminary plans which were also submitted for group criticism these are now standard procedures almost always followed the results have begun to show themselves in the new buildings libraries can be used as libraries and new conceptions of library service are emerging any attempt to trace the evolution of the tremendous changes in conceptions of library service and to assign credit where credit is due is fraught with danger ernest reece library buildings and planning in library trends i july    burchard david and boyd planning the university library building chapter ix w w bishop the historical development of library buildings in library buildings for library service edited by herman h fussler chicago  pages   and alfred m githens the evolution of a library in the library journal lxxviii december     represent several attempts the difficulty is that no one person understands fully the changes in conception of service that are taking place in all types of libraries school public college and special libraries nor is it easy to evaluate the contributions of experts in the commercial firms manufacturing library equipment particularly those of angus s macdonald during the  the author own difficulties in attempting to show how basic intellectual forces in colleges and universities influence library design suggest that we have paid too little attention to the underlying social and intellectual forces that have resulted in demands for new conceptions of service certain lines of influence seem clear and these can be stated briefly as follows first the adoption of an organization of service based on a subject arrangement as found in several large public libraries cleveland los angeles rochester and enoch pratt did not begin to be felt in universities except in departmental libraries such as the life science library at the university of california and the social sciences reading room of the university of chicago until after colorado and brown opened their new buildings late in  these two buildings one a remodeling of an existing building and one a new structure each planned without knowledge of the other differed considerably in their conception of the word divisional brown grouped a  e burchard c w david and j p boyd eds planning the university library building princeton nj princeton university press  s r e ellsworth the library building and the reader in burchard et al eds planning the university library building and the significance of the divisional reading room plan for university libraries university of colorado studies series a vol xxvi no  boulder colo november

 the library quarterly githens marked a turning point in library architecture antecedents for present day expressions of the idea can be found in the enoch pratt free library and in the library of congress annex skidmore college used the idea for two floors of its building in  the author attempted without success to persuade c z klauder to use it in the university of colorado library in  the reason for refusing being that it restricted the fancy of the architect colorado state college used a modified version of it in  the university of iowa decided in  to adopt the principle but did not complete its building until  hardin simmons and the north dakota state college were the first fully modular buildings though princeton used the idea with wet construction for the lower stories of its building when the state university of iowa decided in  that it intended to try out several new conceptions of undergraduate service it was aware that some if not all of these would fail and have to be abandoned but since these programs demanded special quarters the old type of library building was not suitable this led to a study of macdonald article and to the modular idea when macdonald was first approached late in  he had given up hope as revealed in correspondence with the author that anyone would adopt the idea at iowa request he began with gilbert fish to restudy its engineering aspects the following year he built the mock up in orange virginia that was responsible for convincing librarians and architects that the idea had possibilities like all new ideas this one has gone through the typical stages of evolution the first expressions were sensible then the professionals began to carry the idea astray ie floor thicknesses of five feet in order to accommodate louverall lighting because someone had heard that light fixtures installed flush with the ceilings created light spots and were therefore bad and to disregard the spirit of simplicity and economy that brought the idea into being that the idea did disturb architects there is no doubt one of them ralph a walker wrote as follows out in iowa there is a new library whose ceiling heights are those of the average stack and great expanses of area are given over to hunchbacked minds whose visual horizons are bound by metal pan ceilings and ranges of books all neatly and specially placed so that one field of knowledge is forever caged within its own boundaries the librarian a brlliant man is trapped within the impossible problems generated by universities of thirty thousand students or more one has only to see the building indicated to understand mr walker concern fortunately there are many practicing architects who know that there is more than one kind of philosophy of aesthetics librarians too reveal their own peculiar kind of professional perversity now that they have been given the kind of flexibility they have always yearned for some of them immediately begin to pine for the olden days mr keyes metcalf one of the wisest of modern librarians at the june  american library association buildings institute said that he did not like the modo angus snead macdonald a library of the future library journal lviii december       the architect and the university library paper read at the club of odd volumes march   published in a pamphlet entitled books in libraries privately printed
library architecture and buildings  ular idea because it permitted lazy librarians to postpone careful planning until after the building was finished taken literally mr metcalf is of course correct but that is about as absurd as saying that trout anglers should not wear hip boots because some of them are tempted to go into too deep water and get their feet wet the real contributions and maximum usefulness of the modular idea cannot be determined now a decade of experience and study must elapse and the first generation of uncritical enthusiasts and unbending opponents must go its way no one who will take the trouble to observe the new modular buildings in operation can deny that they meet the librarian need for flexibility and that they can house any library program now in existence or in the dreams of the most visionary librarian future applications would seem to be determined by two factors  is flexibility needed in the entire building or in certain areas only  does the idea satisfy people aesthetically a third line of influence has been the desire on the part of librarians and architects to make libraries physically inviting informal and easy to use enoch pratt was perhaps the library that started this trend with its sidewalk level display windows and its open shelf subject divisions immediately accessible to readers today this influence has led to new approaches in the use of color to new furniture design to lounges with facilities for coffee hours and receptions to the use of modern art as decoration and to acceptance of the idea that the needs and habits of people are an important element in determining the nature of a library building it is not necessary to document this trend beyond saying that most of the libraries erected since world war ii illustrate it typical examples would be rice institute princeton georgia tech massachusetts institute of technology the fort worth public library the south chicago branch of the chicago public library the bellingham washington public library and the whittier california school library in other words a library is no longer an instrument which an architect can shape to satisfy his desire to create beauty it is a machine planned to facilitate certain human activities under conditions of maximum beauty and convenience each type of library has developed its own manifestation of this influence in the public library typical elements are found a street level entrance with attractive displays near the entrance on the main floor an open shelf collection of books selected on a subject basis subordination of the loan desk as a symbol of the old fashioned barrier between the reader and the book a control point near the entrance generous staff facilities a significant location of the children library often with its own separate entrance adequate facilities for the use of audiovisual materials rooms for group discussions of adult education functions generous use of glass walls and internal movable partitions instead of bearing walls the following quotation by a british writer in the london times literary supplement catches the spirit very well inside the library in this flourishing town in the deep south it is beautifully cool the library is a refuge during the steaming summers when the temperature is in the nineties the feet stick to the baking pavements and even the native is blinded by the sun everything is done to welcome the passer by who
 the library quarterly drops in not necessarily to read or to choose a book but perhaps to rest or to meet friends the aim of the chief librarian he says is to make his library a rendezvous where people will be comfortable and feel at home where the young may take pleasure in making appointments as they might at the drug store or the movies so the library is air conditioned it has comfortable chairs pictures and posters a browsing room friendly curators andconstant music the last is an innovation not unanimously approved but generally popular which illustrates perhaps the distracting influences with which the potential reader has to deal the librarian regards himself as a business man like any other he wants to sell the idea of reading so just as the church in this bible belt has turned itself into a sort of gigantic friendly society with social activities fashion parades and every sort of entertainment thrown in and has attracted thereby enormous congregations so the library authorities want to attract readers by providing them with subsidiary pleasures in the library proper the gramophone music provided is respectable but not too heavy it is also intermittent with pauses for recuperation in the art room from which admirable reproductions of modern masters can be borrowed free of charge and in which the walls are hung with modem paintings the music is classical and continuous the art room is a sort of third programme to which a reader listener graduates from downstairs in the basement there are meetings of local cultural organizations such as the ballet theatre in fact the library is the centre of civic culture this broad conception generous friendly and enlightened is so admirable that an observer must wish to see it applied though more quietly in english towns from the point of view of salesmanship it is a great success the library and its branches are always full of people more surprisingly the books are actually borrowed in large numbers a library user must often wait even for the works of rather esoteric english novelists like mr henry green the visitor gains an impression from the librarian and the shelves of a great reading nublic in the college and university field one finds many of the same manifestations flexible interiors arrangement of material by subject rather than by type of material subordination of barriers between readers and books locating collections and services in proximity to the main entrance according to the frequency of their use grouping of materials by family groups university of cincinnati in  audio visual rooms grouping of materials according to student needs eg harvard threefold service buildingslamont widener and houghton and a grouping of services so that the highest possible quality of staff can be secured university of nebraska a fourth the geographic or sectional influence on library buildings has come about in a curious manner in  gilchrist proudly commented that in planning the new university of rochester library the university architects visited libraries as far west as the university of minnesota this was and to some extent still is the attitude of eastern librarians and architects but today many of the most interesting examples of new thinking are found west of the mississippi washington state college oklahoma a  m college university of colorado university of nebraska rice north dakota state college state university of iowa tacoma washington public library whittier california school library colorado state college of education st cloud minnesota state teachers college and the f b ross branch of the denver public library to mention a few further since universities and the cities of the west were expanding and  september   p  ibrary journal lvi april   
library architecture and buildings  changing their method of growth during a time when the eastern universities and cities were relatively static it was inevitable that the early advocates of libraries with flexible or adaptable interiors would be listened to in the west two prominent examples may be cited in  sydney b mitchell wrote that the library building should be of a relatively temporary character or    it should be so constructed that its arrangement and use can be altered with the least expense and miss althea warren commented in  that the american city changes so dizzily that it is often just as well if buildings are not eternally enduring it should be noted in this connection that just as harvard achieves its flexibility through the division of three buildings so the large city systems achieve theirs by an arrangement of mobile or adaptable branch buildings a m githens proposed in  that branches be located and built in such a way that they can be converted to commercial use if the need occurs and this principle has been generally accepted dozens of examples have been described in the library journal a fifth influence has been the application of new theories of administrative procedure as late as  librarians worked in positions that usually included all levels of work from the most difficult to simple clerical work today each library operation has been analyzed and measured and grouped according to level of complexity and assigned to workers who have been trained for each level of work today the nonprofessional part of a university library staff is usually at least as large as the professional similarly library operations have been analyzed according to their physical relationships and are usually grouped so that function flows smoothly and directly this means that library interiors are arranged in such a manner that the technical processes are in the correct relationship to the reference departments the charging desks and the stacks and the library is planned so that a book flows smoothly and directly from the shipping room eventually into the hands of the reader at a point relatively close to the guard desk at the main entrance to the buildingl the architect is not allowed to interfere with this arrangement nor does he wish to because he too is seriously trying to make form follow function a sixth influence is the development of new building methods and materials dry construction made feasible by new welding techniques has made modular planning possible although only three libraries georgia hardin simmons and north dakota state college have made full use of the method also fluorescent lighting has freed libraries from reliance on natural lighting and thus permits a more economical massing of a building widespread use of artificial means of circulating air and of air cooling equipment has of course accompanied this new development most of the new large buildings are planned without light wells and older buildings are filling them in new theories of light levels and effects were proposed in  logan research has revolutionized thinking in this respect lighting of school libraries has ibrary journal lxiv    library journal lxix   alibrary journal lxx    h l logan lighting libraries library journal lxxvii

library architecture and buildings  selves many conflicting developments are at work and no one can predict the outcome regional storage centers will surely eliminate the necessity of indefinite expansion on each campus libraries may need to acquire fewer old books and special collections in the future but on the other hand the rate of new publication is increasing and libraries have few oriental materials as yet nor have librarians reckoned with what will happen when russian materials are available and when the orient and africa and south america become industrialized as they surely will nor have librarians made more than a beginning at collecting the primary source material of our own time in my opinion libraries will add more than they will subtract the demands on college and university libraries for research probably will not cause radical changes in their interior planning but the demands for teaching will the impetus that princeton and iowa gave to the concept of a teaching library laboratory is increasingly being felt despite ridicule from some members of the library profession it is quite possible that the liberal arts colleges will be separated from the large universities to be relocated into many strong but small colleges like oberlin mills reed and amherst it would not be surprising to see these grafted onto the many already existing teachers colleges if this happens the role of the university library will be clarified on the other hand strong college library collections by the hundreds will have to be developed it is in these that one would look for adoption of the library laboratory concept in the newer university libraries that have anticipated it one can find a sizable number of faculty members in the building all day except when they leave to lecture to large classes this already has led to the need for enlarged staff rooms provisions for smoking and talking telephone service to large numbers of research offices and demand for sixteen hours aday access to the building all these affect library architecture libraries of the future may not be modular but woe unto those that are not adaptable
