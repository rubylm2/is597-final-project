do we really need cultural diversity in the library and information science curriculum william c welburn what should a course in cultural diversity or multiculturalism look like in library and information science before this question can be answered it is necessary to raise a series of fundamental questions about the place of diversity in the curriculum why should any program in library and information science commit scarce precious resources to such an endeavor is this no more than a fad within the academy primarily affecting undergraduate education can any institution really afford to teach about diversity in the educational preparation of professionals all might be relevant questions if we were academic blacksmiths who forge our curricula in the hot fires of cost benefit but we come to the academy with a range of scholarly and professional interests as do the students we admit to our programs more important however we are engaged in programs of study that are designed to prepare graduate students as professionals mediating between information and people it is this last point that i wish to focus upon as a basis for the inclusion of diversity as a necessary component of our curricula defining cultural diversity while our programs have succeeded in merging theory and practice in teaching the technologies of retrieval and management of information service organizations we have done this without a similar level of discussion of the people who seek information what we mean by cultural diversity is not well defined because we are not focused on theoretical and substantive issues that assist us in defining our interpersonal and intercultural relationships with our clientele in an effort to define what cultural diversity is i will paraphrase the writer kamau brathwaite who suggests from his caribbean rastacentric perspective that we are referring to a cultural process perceived as taking place within a continuum of space and time   one that takes into account the relationships between cultures within a given society or geographic location over time in other words cultural diversity is not the mere existence of different cultures occupying a single space it is a dynamic engagement between cultures their values beliefs and ways of knowing brathwaite has argued that at least in the caribbean context such a process has resulted in creolization which can be bifurcated into acculturation or the yoking of one culture to another and interculturation or the unplanned unstructured but osmotic relationship proceeding from this yoke  volume  number 
culturol diversity  about the author william c welburn is assistant dean for graduate studies at the university of iowa iowa city i believe that this is a much stronger argument for the inclusion of cultural diversity in the development of educational objectives for library and information science than population projections such as those in the workforce  report it is a much stronger argument because it takes history and context into account to help define presentday needs it also maintains that such an initiative will not end with the passage of artificially created milestones most important of all an approach to understanding cultural diversity as a dynamic concept is compatible with our effort to educate professionals who are at the center of an interplay between people and information i have argued in another paper that it is imperative that we recognize the role of culture in each of the three elements that compose this relationship the cultural contexts of information its origins and uses of information seekers and of information mediators and providers all of these elements ought to have a major impact on how we teach students entering library and information science cultural diversity and the curriculum there are three important considerations to teaching a separate course in cultural diversity first such a course would have to be considered to be an intermediate or transitional step toward rethinking the curriculum at large second a separate course should at least in my view revolve around the trifold concept of linkages between the multicultural contexts of information its users and information providers third distinctions should be drawn between diversity as a workplace issue and diversity as a service issue in my opinion workplace concerns are more appropriately presented within the context of teaching management while service and workplace issues do overlap the literature on human resources management is by comparison more clearly focused on intercultural relationships the law on equality discrimination and affirmative action and policy affecting employment there is an important dilemma that we must face when we consider pedagogical issues in multiculturalism and cultural diversity in library and information science education we lack a body of knowledge and a critical mass of scholars engaged in the kind of research that can be used in affecting a shift in pedagogy there is a paucity of scholarship on racialethnic perspectives in information and library science contrast our predicament with law where a body of literature has emerged in the areas of critical race theory and feminist scholarship intellectual freedom and rights guaranteed under the first amendment of the constitution is an example that is dear to us two recent books worth our reading are catharine mackinnon only words and mari matsuda charles lawrence richard delgado and kimberle crenshaw words that wound critical race theory assaultive speech and the first amendfall 
 journal of education for library and information science menta both books offer challenges to an absolute protection of free speech based on a critical analysis of discrimination equal protection and sexual and racial harassment both are also examples of the critical discussions needed in our field however in the absence of a similar dialogue on intellectual freedom and cultural diversity inside our field it may be possible that these works can be imported to frame discussion on intellectual freedom as a conceptual basis for the interaction described earlier in the model relating information its users and mediators within cultural contexts summary i have attempted to create a conceptual framework for the discussion of diversity and the curriculum in library and information science i have sketched what i believe to be the core elements of a transitional course more than a trite phrase cultural diversity has an important role in educating professionals in the s it is central to understanding the former yugoslavia post apartheid south africa racial formation in colombia brazil and southern mexico haitian refugees in new york or florida diversity within the hispanic population in the united states south and southeast asian migration to north america anxiety over hate speech on college campuses and the resurgence of xenophobia in society at large as a profession librarians and other information professionals interact with scholars who are drawn to study such issues affecting these and other cultural groups retrieve information for policy makers for further analysis and policy formation and work crossculturally in classrooms and media centers in libraries and over the internet to facilitate access the task for the mediator or provider of information to a multiethnic jiiuficultural society is to combine the wealth of our understanding about how access is accomplished with a better understanding of the people who need see and use information references  edward kamau brathwaite contradictory omens cultural diversity and integration in the caribbean kingston jamaica savacou     ibid  william welburn moving beyond cliche cultural diversity and the curriculum in library and information studies paper presented at the conference library and information studies education and the american mosaic mapping curricular reform queens college queens new york october    cathanne mackinnon only words cambridge mass harvard univ pr  maria matsuda and others words that wound critical race theory assaultive speech and the first amendment boulder colo westview press  mackinnon book is based on a series of lectures given by the author that have a much wider audience than the legal community matsuda and others is a collection of articles published earlier in law reviews volume  number
