librarians as organic intellectuals a gramscian approach to blind spots and tunnel vision douglas raber in the january  issue of library quarterly wayne wiegand suggests that library and information science us has failed to critically examine its role in relations of power and knowledge that systematically marginalize the needs of less powerful members of society what we know and what we allow ourselves to know about libraries and their users is conditioned by history and politics the work of antonio gramsci can help us to understand this situation librarians and scholars of uis occupy a space that is contested terrain in a war of position between the hegemony of the capitalist historic bloc and the subjects who would challenge that bloc to be true to its self declared principles of democratic participation gramsci insights regarding the nature of capitalist social formations and the role of intellectuals organic to these formations reveal the ambivalent social position of lis as a source of both support and resistance to capitalist hegemony introduction in library qyarterly january  issue wayne wiegand expresses a fear that plans regarding the future of librarianship are affected by blind spots and tunnel vision in large part because the cultures in which we are immersed or to which we aspire tend to control the range of questions we ask about ourselves and our profession  p  in order to identify some of the questions we should be asking he reviews the literature of american library history addressing a period from  to the present he concludes that the profession and the academic research ostensibly providing it with a legitimating body of  this article is a revised version of a presentation at the library research seminar n partners and connections research applied to practice university of maryland college park november     associate professor university of tennessee school of information sciences  circle park drive knoxville tennessee   telephone    fax    e mail raberdutkedu library quartcrly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
 the library quarterly knowledge is trapped in its own discursive formations where members speak mostly to each other and where connections between power and knowledge that affect issues of race class age and gender among others are either invisible or ignored  p  perhaps even more troubling is wiegand implied suggestion that this practice is systematic and deliberate if not entirely conscious he explicitly notes that the work of certain critical theorists and interdisciplinary scholars that might help us to address the issue he identifies is generally absent from library and information science discourse  pp     to support this claim he refers to an unscientific survey he conducted of a couple of recent volumes of the journalfor the american society of information science and he reports that he found little evidence of an awareness of the ambivalent relations between power and knowledge or any sign of an effort to explore douglas zweizig concern that library and information science research privileges institutions over people and tends to view the latter as a means to the ends of the former  pp    library and information science lis practice and research appears to display a systematic tendency to attend to some issues while allowing others of at least equal importance to go unarticulated undefined and untheorized this condition according to wiegand is the cause of our blind spots and tunnel vision evidently not everyone in library and information science agrees with wiegand observations donald case in a comment published in the october  issue of library quarterly questions wiegand conclusions and asserts that one scholar unnel vision may be another scholar microscope  p  case also expresses disappointment that wiegand essay deteriorates into yet another instance of disciplinary navel gazing  p  actually case comment may represent more than even he realizes but there is one point he raises that deserves immediate attention as noted earlier wiegand refers to the work of certain scholars whose work might help lis to overcome its limited vision and he refers to six persons in particular case fairly asks why these six writers he is certainly correct when he asserts that wiegand list is not inclusive but his claim that it is inconsistent  the pejorative use of the phrase navel gazers is interesting in its own right this use suggests the disparagement of inward looking contemplation as being otherworldly excessively idealistic or self absorbed and certainly not practical the stereotyping of eastern culture and religion and the privileging of a western pragmatic point of view regarding contemplation is also potentially involved scholars such as edward said might suggest that the casual use of such language even with the intention of merely being humorous says more about its speakers than they realize but that is a subject for another study  the six theorists identified by wiegand are michel foucault antonio gramscijirgen habermas helen longino margaretjacob and sandra harding
librarians as organic intellectuals  may have missed the mark  p  conceived broadly critical theory in the human sciences has a long history a rich discourse and is represented by a great number of writers  it includes marxism postmarxism poststructuralism and postmodernism psychoanalysis hermeneutics phenomenology and semiotics to name but a few of the lines of thought associated with critical theory at best wiegand list serves as a set of index terms to this literature on the other hand the six writers he names share a common characteristic they study the connections between power and knowledge and they would agree with wiegand that these connections are never totally objective and never disinterested  p  one of the writers wiegand mentions is antonio gramsci my goal is to show how gramsci work can help to explain the blind spots and tunnel vision of lis and to provide a means for expanding our vision gramsci is especially relevant to the issues raised by wiegand because he explicitly addresses how the culture in which we are immersed controls the range of questions we can ask about ourselves and our historical situation to be specific gramsci work suggests that librarians can be viewed as organic intellectuals and that they play an ideological and organizational role in maintaining a historic bloc hegemony over the relations of economic production and civil society from this perspective the apparently neutral discourse of lis regarding access to information can be examined as a discourse that privileges particular rather than universal interests gramsci marxism in order to understand the concept of organic intellectual we must first review gramsci development of marxist theory the notion that human being and history are products of human labor provides the foundation of his thought the production and reproduction of value culture and even our bodies constitute the material foundation for human existence the relations of production that socially organize this labor constitute the structure on which is built particular superstructures at particular points in human history the superstructure includes not only the state and its associatedjuridical and coercive institutions but also the social and cultural institutions and practices typically associated with the idea of civil society together base and superstructure constitute a social formation that gramsci calls the historic bloc in our time the historic bloc is one of capitalist democracy characterized by private ownership of the means of production and wage labor and ideologically organized by a discourse of parliamentary and electoral politics while formally organized at the level of the
 the library quarterly nation state this social formation is a global phenomenon and it exercises hegemony over economic and political relations  pp   gramsci use of the word bloc in this context is important a historic bloc is not merely a structural phenomenon as a social formation it depends on political principles and alliances that are subject to constant negotiation challenge and change it is characterized by diverse interests whose particular fortunes and influence will vary as an outcome of political contests both within the bloc and between the bloc and its historical challengers it organizes and assesses its hegemony over society largely by controlling the terms of political discourse and setting the agenda of that discourse but its own internal divisions combined with events and behaviors beyond its control can create historical imperatives to which it must respond in effect a historical bloc represents a form of social contract it is relatively stable but subject to renegotiation the concepts of structure and superstructure arise from marx assertion that relations of production constitute the economic structure of society the real foundation on which rises a juridical and political superstructure  p  the ideas that dominate and govern a particular moment in history are the ideas of the class that dominates and governs the means and relations of material production  given these kinds of statements it is not difficult to see how some interpreters of marx arrive at the conclusion that marxism represents an economic determinism but one must also recall that marx insists that men are the producers of their conceptions ideas etcreal active men as they are conditioned by a definite development of their productive forces and of the intercourse corresponding to these  p  his point is simply that circumstances make men just as much as men make circumstances  p  social reality must be understood as the material outcome of a dialectical relationship between human beings and their circumstances the historic bloc then is an outcome of this relationship in his explanation of human nature gramsci makes clear that the historic bloc and the superstructure that represents it is not merely a determined outcome of certain relations of production the measure of freedom enters into the concept of man that the objective possibilities exist for people not to die of hunger and that people do die of hunger has its importance or so one would have thought but the existence of objective conditions of possibilities or of freedom is not yet enough it is necessary to know them and to know how to use them and to want to use them man in this sense is concrete will that is the effective application of the abstract will or vital impulses to the concrete means of which realise such a will man is to be conceived as an historical bloc of purely individual

librarians as organic intellectuals  membership that is a subject location in a social formation with regard to the relations of production between capital and labor is a fundamental but not determining factor it plays a large but hardly exclusive role in the construction of a subject political interest in althusser language the relations of production are in the last instance the determining force within social formations but this is an instance that may never fully arrive precisely because of willful counterdetermining resistance to their logic the continued dominance of capitalist relations of production is no more assured than their radical transformation  the outcome of the contest between capital and the resistance to it that arises from the exploitation following from the differences that capital creates and maintains will be determined by what gramsci calls the war of position this is a struggle of ideological and political practice that is protracted and ordinarily takes place on the terrain of civil society but in some instances it can occur within the state itself  pp    and   it is in the context of this kind of war that both the progressive and conservative nature of libraries can be seen but to get to this we must first take a look at gramsci analysis of how capitalist social formations are politically organized and reproduced the historic bloc and hegemony central to gramsci analysis of both hegemony and the war of position is the concept of the historical bloc at any given moment in the life of a social formation there is only one historic bloc it organizes and dominates base and superstructure and the relations between them in order to reproduce the means and relations of production from which it derives its resources its political power and its intellectual cultural or as gramsci calls it its ethico political hegemony the base provides a historic bloc its content and the superstructure gives it form  p  the historic bloc represents political alliances but it cannot be reduced to a mere political alliance  pp   it is a complex contradictory and discordant ensemble of the superstructures that is the reflection of the ensemble of the social relations of production  p  a historic bloc is an ensemble of social groups intellectual and ideological forces organized around the historic interests of the fundamental social group that organizes and leads the bloc  pp   hegemony is a concept gramsci uses to clarify the nature of a historic bloc power this power is dominant but not dominating it is far from total and as mentioned earlier it is exercised by setting political
 the library quarterly agendas rather than by dictating political outcomes gramsci writes that the supremacy of a social group manifests itself in two ways as omination and as ntellectual and moral leadership a social group dominates antagonistic groups which it tends to iquidate or to subjugate perhaps even by armed force it leads kindred and allied groups a social group can and indeed must already exercise eadership before winning governmental power this indeed is one of the principal conditions of winning such power it subsequently becomes dominant when it exercises power but even as it holds it firmly in its grasp it must continue to ead as well  pp   a ruling historic bloc then relies as much if not more on ideological leadership exercised through agents constituted by civil society rather than on coercion exercised directly as state power in fact the historic bloc is likely to be more politically successful when it does so the collapse of soviet hegemony in russia for example is clearly related to failures on the part of the historic bloc led by the communist party to reconcile contradictions between its claims to ideological leadership and its need to rely on state coercion to retain power it is precisely this need to rely on intellectual and moral leadership that opens a dominant hegemony to a challenge of its legitimacy on its own terms and suggests historical roles for intellectual groups including professionals gramsci saw this as crucial to a war of position there will always be challenges to a historical bloc some will be based on traditional segments of society generally seeking a return to a mythical past others will be based on marginalized and radicalized segments seeking a transformation to a utopian future some will arise from within the bloc itself as different interests that constitute it assert different visions of the bloc future perhaps at this moment the last instance arrives in marxist theory of capitalist social formations the fundamental social group is the bourgeoisie in late capitalist societies direct ownership of the means of production typically is dispersed so this group instead consists of those who exercise direct control over the means of production to render this phenomenon in a way that captures its complexity however accounts for the overdetermined relations between base and superstructure avoids personalization and recognizes the problems of class as a theoretical and historical category i will refer to it simply as capital among other problems the historic bloc of capital may not be dominated by the bourgeoisie as a class and the subjects of its dominance may not be exclusively the working class or proletariat in the past and in nondemocratic capitalist social formations the historic bloc is often organized by social groups other than the bourgeoisie on behalf of capital  the military for example typically takes a lead

 the library quarterly maintenance of capital power but also by a widespread acceptance of the discourse of democracy legitimacy even among the members of the historic bloc by granting a legitimate place to the discourse of democracy in its political strategy and accepting the idea that this implies meaningful participation beyond voting and formal equality of citizenship the historic bloc brings an intellectual reality into play and finds in persuasion an ideological solution to the frailty of its hegemony ultimately this solution is based on the widespread acceptance of a panglossian observation that while not perfect capitalist relations of production when combined with a political superstructure of parliamentary democracy rationallegal structures of governance and authority equality before the law and a guarantee of individual rights makes for the best of all possible worlds there is powerful empirical evidence for this claim certainly since world war ii the general level of prosperity in the capitalist west has increased the cultures of western capitalist democracies manifest a real commitment to human rights and the nation states based on these cultures display pluralist polities that represent diverse political interests and compromise among these interests despite evident political partisanship concurrence with a panglossian viewpoint however can also be taken as evidence of the effectiveness of the capitalist historic bloc ideological strategy in a war of position given the persistence of systematic and structural inequalities and exclusions the relative privileging of property rights over human rights and the tendency to privilege market relations over human relations by privileging commodities over their producers late capitalism however offers a complex political situation in which the nexus that conditions the location of historical subjects tends to work against polarization there are wealthy suburbanites who support environmental causes and rural industrial workers that reject unions this condition invites us to return to gramsci the war of position that characterizes politics in late capitalism is not a war of violent civil strife it is instead an ideological war conducted over a long term and its goal is to alter the relations of production that unnecessarily limit human freedom to accomplish this goal the social formation must be altered at its base in order to realize the collective nature of the production of human values and to transcend the private appropriation and commodification of human labor according to gramsci the political means of accomplishing these ends lies in challenging capital hegemony within the superstructure he argues that progressive social groups and individuals must penetrate civil society of the dominant hegemony seize positions within

 the library quarterly  p  the capitalist possesses and uses intellectual qualities as an organizer of relations of production the worker likewise possesses and uses intellectual qualities but often without a clear theoretical consciousness of his or her activity this last point is especially important because it implies the existence of a space from which intellectual resistance to the historic bloc can arise intellectual then is a broad theoretical term describing anyone who exercises an organizational function in a wide sense whether in the field of production or that of culture or that of political organization  p  of those who can be formally identified as intellectuals some including academics physicians and the clergy for example appear to exist outside of a context established by capitalist relations of production these traditional intellectuals  pp   and their social functions existed prior to the rise of the capitalist historic bloc they belong to an earlier time and appear to represent a historic continuity as well as a political neutrality with respect to the capitalist historic bloc their origins however trace back to an organic link to the preindustrial historic bloc the clergy role as the source and organizer of morality in preindustrial social formations is perhaps the best example of this link these practices were crucial to the feudal hegemony grounded on the divine right of kings to exercise governing authority but they were ideologically co opted and adapted by the nineteenth century bourgeoisie to provide the foundation for victorian morality  traditional intellectuals then are assimilated into the capitalist historic bloc and indeed are often crucial allies and members of this bloc providing important organizing and organic services not the least of which is an ideological legitimation of the capitalist historic bloc hegemony as a natural extension of prior historical developments  p  in contrast organic intellectuals  pp   emerge as a historic bloc ascends to power and begins to assert its hegemony over a social formation for capital these intellectuals include technicians engineers managers economists lawyers librarians and now information professionals they are the organizers of capitalist hegemony and its culture and they play central strategic and ideological roles in the superstructure that reproduces capitalist relations of production these intellectuals are the dominant group eputies exercising the subaltern functions of social hegemony and political government  p  they are organized and related by the historic bloc through its industrial and state bureaucracies serving the bloc by fulfilling certain functions that require their expertise and by providing the bloc with a homogeneity and an awareness of its own function not only in the economic but also in the social and political fields  p  the
librarians as organic intellectuals  function at issue here is no less than the organizing and ruling function of the capitalist historic bloc organic intellectuals then provide the link between the base and superstructure that in turn provides capital with its identity as the fundamental group and leader of the historic bloc these intellectuals are essential for the practical and ideological exercise of capitalist hegemony we are now in a position to offer a gramscian explanation of wiegand observation that librarians among other intellectuals are trapped in their own discursive formations librarians as intellectuals and librarianship as a practice are immersed in a culture determined by the hegemony of the capitalist historic bloc indeed they serve a positive function in the production and reproduction of this bloc and its hegemony under these circumstances it is unlikely that librarians will raise questions that critically interrogate the relations of power and knowledge that sustain capitalist hegemony to do so would not only challenge the authority of the historic bloc it might also lead to sanction against those posing the questions wiegand notion of immersion is important here because it helps us to understand the nature of the politics at work for many in lis this immersion means that critical questions regarding their own role in the historic bloc simply will not occur to them as they accept its legitimacy and see no reason to question its means or its ends for those who might question this legitimacy the threat of sanction is real in this instance however immersion has different implications recall that late capitalist social formations generally do not rely on overt coercion to enforce discipline immersion creates a situation in which coercion is not necessary instead discipline is enforced through various ideological mechanisms that send messages as much as they provide incentives or deny benefits transgressors for example are denied funding for library operations find themselves unable to obtain research grants are not chosen to give presentations at professional conferences and are marginalized in the research literature this discipline can be effective precisely because the transgressors are themselves immersed in the dominant culture and depend on that culture for their social position in addition this discipline does not appear as oppressive to those exercising it as in their eyes the transgressors are not formally denied free speech indeed they are allowed to speak and then dismissed as either incorrect or as navel gazers whose concerns are not relevant to more important matters wiegand brief reexamination of the history of american librarianship might be regarded as an instance of such navel gazing but it reveals a profession that rather consistently overlooks its own contribution to the imbalances of power and knowledge that in turn contribute
 the library quarterly to the systematic exclusion of certain groups of people from full participation in capitalist social formations wiegand asserts that throughout the twentieth century a dominant professional imperative systematically privileged some library purposes and audiences to the exclusion of others he argues that this trend is also visible in the practice of information science the nformation science that has developed in the last years of the twentieth century constitutes an arena of study in which the technology to which it is harnessed defines the field  and to the extent that people nformation economy does not require the use of these technologies within the culture in which they live current nformation science discourse renders them and their cultures invisible largely by ignoring both  p  questions that information science might ask about the information needs uses and behaviors of marginalized people in a capitalist social formation are not regarded as important enough to deserve concern as wiegand might say at this point blind spots and tunnel vision stand revealed in an earlier work michael harris used gramscian theory to examine blind spots and tunnel vision in the practice of public librarianship his particular concern was with practice that reinforced print culture as an aspect of capitalist hegemony  he locates librarianship as a historical subject in an ensemble of institutions both public and private constituting the means of sanctioning and distributing public knowledge in a capitalist social formation in effect he describes librarians as intellectuals organic to the dominant culture of capitalist hegemony according to harris the central role of libraries as a state apparatus and agent of capitalist ideological hegemony is the preservation transmission and thus the reproduction of the book and the audience for the book  p  while simple enough in itself the implications of this statement have been contextualized by what harris provides before it the word book for example is deliberately capitalized harris does so to indicate its role as a symbolic representation of high culture the canon of western civilization that grounds and provides the legitimacy for capital worldview as universal and universalizing as well as its claim that its particular vision of the ends of cultural reproduction are in fact also universal the library along with the bookstore is one of the least powerful institutions at the end of a chain of both state and civil institutions that function to produce and reproduce the cultural hegemony of capital in the form of the book producers and publishers are at the top of this chain while reviewers and other tastemakers including educators are located somewhere near the middle this condition also tends to privilege some books some uses of those books and some users of them while it marginalizes and excludes others
librarians as organic intellectuals  librarians as professionals participate in this function as organic intellectuals they appear to have some autonomy with regard to selection of materials and provision of services in the libraries they direct this autonomy is ostensibly based on a professional ideology of neutrality with regard to book selection and a commitment to intellectual freedom it is reinforced by the status and trust accorded to librarians as professionals who can demonstrate that their practice is nondiscriminatory based on a rationallegal authority derived from knowledge that is an outcome of a value free research discourse and supported by positive law that guarantees public accountability harris argues however that this autonomy is only apparent and is actually quite limited the library is what althusser calls an ideological state apparatus  pp   selection decisions by librarians are framed by already determined criteria over which librarians have little control the library is a consumer of culture already determined as appropriate for distribution and library and information science research paradigm does not allow these conditions to be problematized this situation resembles one of don ask don tell harris concludes libraries are marginal institutions embedded in a hierarchically arranged set of institutions designed to produce and reproduce the dominant effective culture in print form power is asymmetrically distributed among these institutions the library structural and functional characteristics are determined by its definition as an institution contrived to consume preserve transmit and reproduce high culture in printed form  p  harris like wiegand might be accused of expressing well intended but impractical concerns his theoretical speculations however lead him to assert twenty six related propositions all of which have serious implications for the everyday practice of librarianship  pp  harris offers these propositions as hypotheses in need of investigation not as truths whose certainty is already established in other words he poses critical questions that challenge received wisdom and conventional knowledge like wiegand and zweizig he is concerned about the library in the life of the user many of his propositions point to specific unexplored blind spots regarding relations of power knowledge and access to information alluded to by wiegand if one is to be selected as the most telling it might be this one librarians blame non users for non use of libraries  p  possibilities of resistance a persistent pessimism characterizes the tone of harris essay and it is not entirely absent from wiegand perhaps a sense of futility as
 the library quarterly well as misgivings regarding possible sanction holds in their grip some librarians and lis scholars who might otherwise explore through practice and research the issues raised here but even harris notes that one must not push the metaphor of eproduction too far lest we obscure the real evidence of resistance or counter hegemonic forces in american librarianship  p  despite their tone it seems clear that both harris and wiegand also imply the possibility of a kind of political action that might at least counter the excesses of capitalist hegemony neither wants to give up on an institution thatjesse shera  and sidney ditzion  identify as central to the discourse of democracy in america the historical reality of this discourse when combined with an overall view of gramsci thought reveals a political space within which progressive resistance to the historic bloc hegemony can be and has been mounted recall first of all that the categories of gramscian discourse including structures such as base and superstructure and classes of people such as intellectuals represent theoretical constructs whose concrete historical reality is fluid and malleable both objective structures and subjective positions within structures are open to overdetermination neither human nature nor the nature of human institutions are inexorably fixed by forces of history or hegemony it is entirely possible that the actions of a given structure within a social formation or a given intellectual working within that structure might at a given historical moment be characterized by a conflict between hegemonic and counterhegemonic ideas such a condition is indicative of the war of position according to gramsci ideas do make a difference because human beings are free to act on them change at the superstructural level can cause change in the base turning to the nature of intellectuals specifically gramsci observed that both traditional and organic intellectuals possess a relative autonomy from the historic bloc because of their expertise  p  they perform specialist functions on which the bloc depends and this dependency of the bloc on their skills provides them with a measure of power  pp   as harris argues they may not possess a great deal of power and the threat of sanction is real nevertheless intellectuals including librarians are not entirely constrained in either their thoughts or actions and the range of freedom available has grown in the context of a discourse of democracy that has become integral to at least some capitalist social formations indeed this expansion has occurred precisely because of political struggles conducted by an alliance of people that reflects the potential of a new historical bloc  pp   this alliance includes members of the current historical
librarians as organic intellectuals  bloc who exercise their relative autonomy to pursue change within the bloc as well as people excluded from the bloc  pp   given harris analysis for example the public library may be regarded as an ideological state apparatus it is a state maintained superstructural institution designed not to coerce but to persuade the public of the historical bloc legitimacy by reinforcing the dominant culture from a gramscian perspective it is an ideological weapon in the war of position but it is a double edged weapon librarians as organic intellectuals are in a position to exercise at least some real choice regarding the ends they pursue some libraries may never venture beyond satisfying the conditioned demands of audiences seeking nothing but assurance that this is the best of all possible worlds the actions of these libraries will confirm harris theory some libraries however will seek out the underserved and the unserved and commit significant quantities of their limited resources to engaging these audiences most libraries will fall between these extremes and some of their users will find their own paths through mazes of information and classification systems presented to them to achieve ends that librarians can neither imagine or anticipate  even within a single library it is likely that one will discover some professional practices that represent capitalist hegemony at work and others that challenge that hegemony intellectual freedom regarding book selection for example may be practiced uncritically and imperfectly realized  yet its position in the professional canon of librarianship is not without meaning and it has led librarians to active resistance against censorship  the ambivalent location of the library in the social formation especially within the context of the discourse of democracy means that the library as an agent of hegemony is politically vulnerable it is a potential site of ideological conflict manifest in contests over decisions regarding the nature of its collections services and audiences it is also a stake in that conflict in that it can and perhaps usually does serve the purpose harris describes yet it has the potential to be penetrated and turned counterhegemonic certainly this condition does not imply a revolutionary transformation the library dependence on the state for funding to say nothing of the political conditions and practices of capitalist democracies precludes this outcome this condition however does raise interesting questions that are not free of political implications in what ways and to what extent does the library position in the superstructure and librarianship location as a historical subject result in practices that are progressive or conservative does kathleen mccook  recent work on the library potential role in community building represent a progressive counterhegemonic challenge to the public li
 the library quarterly brary association pla emphasis on administrative rationality  does the latter represent a kind of tunnel vision that limits the library contribution to genuinely progressive social outcomes by defining professional success in terms of the ability of the library to serve the predictable demands of a normatively identified market and what does it say about the american library association that it is willing to publish both mccook and the pla texts it may be that this bears witness to pluralism in action a manifestation of ideological conflict within ala or both gramsci repeatedly asserts that neither theoretical abstractions nor facile assumptions regarding the laws of history will contribute to understanding how civil society actually works at a given moment coming to an understanding of the real conditions of existence in order to exercise a genuine freedom is a difficult task requiring critical empirical study the empirical questions arising from the ambivalent position of libraries in the social formation however also imply that librarians must confront political and moral choices in their everyday practice in his discussion of the problems faced by workers in their effort to develop a theoretical consciousness of their actions gramsci neatly describes a situation that can be applied to librarians  pp   his work suggests that librarians might manifest a contradictory theoretical consciousness on the one hand their activity implies a progressive transformation of the world this is particularly manifest in librarianship long standing commitment to empowering individuals to pursue self culture and lifelong learning  pp    on the other hand they uncritically absorb a theoretical consciousness from the past   this consciousness holds them together as a social group influences their ethico political conduct and will but produces a situation that does not permit action instead reinforcing a moral and political passivity  they offer a potentially progressive and transforming service but they do so in a context that preserves their self interest and liberal identity within the capitalist hegemony thus allowing them to dismiss the need for critical selfw examination a series of questions follow not unlike the propositions advanced by harris in each instance research questions imply political and value questions questions for practice and research  do libraries work within a context of contradiction sustaining a capitalist hegemony and providing a means for users to think beyond that hegemony as well as its limits to human freedom can libraries do more to enhance freedom and overcome the struc
librarians as organic intellectuals  tural barriers that deny to some full participation in the social formation should libraries do this does librarianship conduct a discourse within and about itself that assumes that the important value questions regarding the ends of public library practices and services have already been satisfactorily answered  if the condition indicated by the first question above is true is this then a manifestation of a reality in which the public library is a site and stake of an ideological conflict whose outcome contributes to the production and reproduction of the social formation can we find evidence of this conflict can we find librarians and scholars who do address the issues raised by wiegand and harris and act in ways that reveal blind spots and expand our vision are we hesitant to engage these questions because we might cast ourselves in a less than ideal light might we find ourselves on the wrong side  why do questions like those posed here go unasked why do propositions like those offered by harris go unexamined does the lack of action reveal blind spots and tunnel vision are they not pursued because they are not salient or important or because librarians fulfilling their responsibility as organic intellectuals in support of capital deny the saliency and importance of these questions and propositions is the source of the blind spots and tunnel vision identified by wiegand  if librarians chose to pursue a counterhegemonic strategy would this even be possible to what kinds of discipline would it be subject how are progressive choices constrained or encouraged by a capitalist hegemony that is nevertheless characterized by a discourse of democracy if limits are in place in what ways and to what extent can and should librarians challenge them what strategies can and should be pursued if librarians choose to engage in the war of position conclusion wiegand essay implies that librarianship discourse in both its theoretical and practical aspects is essentially centered on its own status and power within the historical bloc that organizes and governs the american capitalist social formation he argues that information science as an academic discipline willingly if unconsciously contributes to this bloc maintenance and exercise of power by its focus on questions that perhaps manifest truly universal human needs but only on terms favorable to the interests of the capitalist historic bloc he does
 the library quarterly not assign personal blame but rather points to historical and structural conditions that result in the kind of human choices that cause this outcome he asks us all to consider if this is what we truly want he is conscious of the counterhegemonic nature of his statements of the challenge he poses to the historic bloc and the difficulties of the tasks he sets before us one can almost hear him wondering who will take him up on his offer it might well be that gramsci is both right and wrong that modern western social formations are dominated by a capitalist historic bloc whose reach is global in scope but that the discourse of democracy adopted by this bloc ensures reasonable if not entirely fair life outcomes for all of the formation members on the other hand if capitalist democracy continues to suffer from persistent problems of systematic and structural exclusion and marginalization of some its people and because of this condition it diminishes their humanity where should we look for solutions to this problem the history that brings us to any given point in time lays its weight on the choices available to us gramsci however would insist that the future of humanity is not absolutely determined by what came before wiegand essay suggests libraries might be a place to look for choices for a political space in which undetermined choices can be made because sometimes both librarians and the people who use libraries have by their actions challenged and shattered the normative expectations under which they ordinarily labor they have used the resources at hand to determine in small ways new criteria of human freedom references  wiegand wayne a tunnel vision and blind spots what the past tells us about the present reflections on the twentieth century history of american librarianship libraty quarterly  january     zweizig douglas predicting the amount of library use an empirical study of the role of the public library in the life of the adult public phd diss syracuse university   case donald  comment librayy quarterly  october     suber jere paul culture and critique an introduction to the critical discourses of cultural studies boulder colo westview press   gramsci antonio sekections from the prison notebooks edited and trans by quintin hoare and geoffrey n smith new york international publishers   marx karl preface to a contribution to the critique of political economy in his sekcted works vol  p  moscow progress publishers   marx karl the geman ideology part one new york international publishers   laclau ernesto and mouffe chantal hegemony and socialist strategy towards a radical democratic politics london verso
