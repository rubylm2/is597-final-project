are you my mentor identifying mentors and their roles in lis doctoral education  many respondents spoke at length about how their doctoral education trained them for their future life in academe one advisee recalled a veiy deliberate effort on the part of the school  to make the doctoral program have the same kind of benchmarks and feedback mechanisms as junior faculty members have in order to make the transition into an academic po sition relatively seamless id one advisor similarly noted the practice at their institution requiring students to publish as a way in which to prepare them for their future life as a faculty member id the respondent noted that this accultura tion extended beyond the research area i think that part of a doctoral program a good doctoral program is socialization and teaching people about what the aca demic life is about and i don know how much of it is teaching it just providing a model in some waysthey see how you behave they see your responsibilities you have they see your interactionsand i think that you know if theye smart theye going to model themselves and fol low what youe doing id one re spondent noted we have to pay as much attention to acculturation into academe as we do to actually inculcating them with knowledge and you know it isn just about theory and methods it about un derstanding the role of committee meet ings and how universities work and your place in them id in the words of one respondent being a faculty member is not a job it is a way of life id discussion and conclusions as one student noted one faculty member does not serve as a village of doc toral study id the findings from this study indicate that although the advisor is seen as the primary and most dominant mentor in doctoral education there are many other individuals the advisee con sults formally and informally among those the dissertation committee members were the most likely mentors after the ad visor respondents indicated that committee members were chosen to play a purpose ful rolethese individuals were not meant to serve merely an administrative role but were active members of the advisee mentoring team providing both career and psychosocial roles among these roles the most frequently mentioned were method ological assistance literature familiarity subject expertise and editing the advisor appeared to be the leader of the dissertation committee the student selected committee members based on consultation with the advisor and the rest of the committee deferred to the wishes of the advisor some respondents indicated that the advisor was the primary determi nant of what was a passable product while other committee members indicated hold ing the same standards for their students regardless of the advisor this demon strated the range of differences in doctoral education not only on the program level but also on the advisor leveltwo stu dents from the same program may have markedly different expectations of what a dissertation can and should be depend ing on their individual advisors this is something which warrants further inves tigationshould programs institute rigid standards for dissertation work or should the expectations be created by each indi vidual advisor the most frequently reported infor mal mentoring occurred between doctoral student colleagues in some cases these students were working together as part of formalized research collaborations most often however the students merely met informally to provide each other with sup port and counseling the nature of these relationships could be seen to provide more of the psychosocial mentoring ele ments than conferred in any of the more formalized doctoral mentoring structures many of the respondents commented on the concept of idea sharing with their peers it is possible that these forums al
 journal of education for library and information science lowed the students a safe place in which to experiment with new ideas and gain confidence before presenting the ideas to their mentors in this way peer mentoring may provide the critical functions neces sary for each doctoral student growing sense of competence and identity in ad dition many of the students commented on the degree to which role modeling oc curred between studentsfaculty mem bers were at times unable to provide stu dents with detailed instructions on how to progress through the doctoral process senior doctoral students however were able to provide through role modeling and direct instruction advice on how to navigate through the doctoral process in this way the doctoral student community can be seen to provide the missing piece of doctoral mentoringthe advisors and committee members primarily provide the career elements while the doctoral student community provides many of the neces sary psychosocial elements the critical component of the doctoral student com munity begs further investigation espe cially in light of the rise of many distance programs what can programs both on line and on campus do to facilitate the creation of community among doctoral students and encourage idea sharing the results from this study suggest that the career function may weigh more heavily in the doctoral mentoring rela tionship than the psychosocial function when asked to provide examples of men toring respondents focused on research and career advice topics of conversation similarly focused on research and career preparation with the items regarding the respondents personal lives ranking as the least frequent topic of conversation and the most sufficiently discussed veiy few individuals spoke of the psychosocial ele ments of the mentoring relationship those who mentioned elements of role modeling focused on the ways they sought to emulate the advisor career path by im itating how their advisor conducted him herself as a professor and researcher the desire to emulate a career path could be seen in terms of career advancement and a growing sense of the scholar identity and what they desire for their lives it may be the case that the career elements are more explicit than the psychosocial elements and therefore more recognizable and mea surable to the respondents elements such as gaining a sense of competence and iden tity likely occur during the doctoral pro cess but they may be more difficult for the respondents to identify attribution may cause an additional complexity as respon dents may see multiple actors involved in their growing sense of identity as a scholar and be less willing to identify their advisor as the sole provider of this input additionally doctoral education may reflect properties of an intrinsically tran sient social world kazmer  that is a social world that is temporary by its definition p  a successful mentor ing experience involves graduation and therefore many elements of the relation ship can be seen as functions of career ad vancement for example mentoring may include co authorship or co presenting research while strictly contributing to ca reer advancement this may also contrib ute to the scholar sense of competence and identity there is a grey area between these functions in doctoral education where the creation of independent schol ars depends on their own gained sense of competence and identity the point of the relationship where the psychosocial elements seemed to emerge was in the redefinition phase of the advi see career once they had successfully graduated and thereby made a formal separation from their advisor more advi sors reported playing a role as colleague and friend rather than mentor in the post graduation phase of the student life similarly advisees identified advisors as colleagues and friends the point of re definition seems to sever the hierarchical bounds of the mentoring relationship as the two individuals move into peer status it is perhaps this disengagement ka
