on the importance of unimportant documents j g de roulhac hamilton a ssuming from the start that the collection and preservation of manuscript records of various kinds is an activity of large significance the collector is at once confronted by two puzzling questions what manuscripts are sufficiently important to merit preservation and how and by whom can such importance be determined today when american libraries are concerning themselves as never before with the acquisition and care of manuscript material these two questions arise inevitably demanding answers it is obvious of course that all manuscript records cannot be preserved if they were not only libraries but every other sort of building would in the course of time be buried by the mounting flood of paper fortunately however libraries and homes do not have to answer the questions as far as they relate to governmental archives nor is such material within the scope of this present discussion the fact withdraws from our consideration perhaps the largest aspect of the whole problem but the questions remain and are vitally important with respect to the sort of material with which a library has to deal library practice which is highly variable still further limits the questions every depository of manuscripts has its own field and its own goal fairly well determined only a very few if any institutions seek to acquire and preserve manuscripts without limit of geography or subject or both the great majority limit their activity to the state in which they are situated a lesser number devote their attention to a particular region some confine their work to a particular subject the library of congress and perhaps a few others have the whole united states as a field but they all limit their activities in various ways all devote their attention and confine their gatherings to the papers of the great or the near great chiefly in the fields of politics literature science the arts and the war the manuscript division of the library of congress for example has again and again declined to accept collections of manuscripts because they related to persons without national reputation and thereby lost as it seems to me the  ii

the importance of unimportant documents s public opinion and popular movements by contacts with individuals out of the mass of men from that standpoint alone the records of the supposed unimportant individuals would have high value but there is an even larger aspect of the case more and more historians and historically minded people are impressed with the significance of social history the portrayal of the life and thought as far as such a thing can be achieved of the people as a whole in that life and thought can be found a far clearer explanation of the past than is to be gathered from the lives and thoughts of the great if this be so as in spite of much dissent from sources not to be lightly disregarded i firmly believe it is then such records as can be saved which portray that life and thought are incalculably valuable in the cause of history it is strange how little attention has been paid to such material only comparatively few collecting agencies have set any value upon the records of ordinary folk including the pitifully few that survive of the submerged mass of the humble and obscure of those that god must like because he made so many of them and yet such records throw light sometimes very bright light on every movement of significance in american history applying the preliminary questions before asked to the records of the mass we find of primary importance among them letters and such documents as appear in masses of correspondence just here the collector will be met by one of his greatest difficulties just as institutions have failed to see value in such material so the owners in a majority of cases not only fail to see it but are hard to convince that it is there in the course of a good many years i have interviewed some thousands of persons on the subject of preservation of the correspondence and other papers of their families only in a small majority of cases where there was no outstanding person in the family history have i failed to have them say oh they have no historical value we haven had any governors or senators or generals in our family or those things would not be of any interest outside the immediate family they are all just family or personal letters and some are never convinced of the contrary i recall one case in particular where i was informed by an estimable and highly intelligent woman that all the papers of her family had been burned when they moved from the plantation to the city she told of letters from lee davis beauregard and numerous other southern leaders that had so perished in flames expressing her keen regret that she did not have them to turn over to me she was entirely

the importance of unimportant documents i thus perished a remarkable body of unimportant documents but nonetheless a unique collection of important information millbooks shopbooks the records of early factories all have similar value old church records it might be supposed would be regarded as important they are very important as a matter of fact in social as well as in religious history but the thousands of them found in garrets junkrooms and secondhand bookstores separated from the congregations of their origin show that they are not generally so regarded in counties where courthouse fires have occurred and in states where registration was not compulsory old deeds and wills are worthy of preservation i have known of one case where an original will returned to the executor after being recorded and still among his papers determined the questioned ownership of many thousands of acres of valuable land lists and bills of sale of slaves have value in several ways and they are not only a part of plantation history but constitute almost the first american records of a foreign race that is now american plantation diaries one of the most valuable of sources for the historians of the ante bellum south are often regarded by their owners as of no importance only three years ago i was told of the burning of a set of them containing an entry for every day for more than forty years included in each entry besides the plantation routine and family happenings was the temperature wind and weather report for the day it is clear that one can never tell what will be turned up in such material and because of that there is no absolute measure of value that can be applied to a document a hundred even a thousand historical experts might pronounce it worthless and the next reader discover a fact or even just a clue that is to him at least of inestimable importance the solution seems to be to attempt to save all of it the older such manuscripts are the greater their value is likely to be but relatively modern material has value even some of that which was written yesterday and some that will be written tomorrow next year and through the years to come in my search for southern manuscripts i am constantly asked to set a date limit on what i want my invariable answer is that i want everything back of io and a great deal this side of that date in the south that date as far as any one year can be said to be a dividing line in history marks the end of an era reconstruction had come definitely to an end as far as family
si the library quarterly correspondence is concerned it is even more important for a different reason about that time people in general began to forget how to write letters a process that has continued ever since hastened of course by many influences too obvious to mention while important letters are still written family and personal correspondence generally speaking will never again be as important as in earlier days it seems clear if the history of any period is worth while that the picture of its social system is vitally important if not absolutely necessary to its complete understanding and this can be drawn only with the aid of what are generally belittled or ignored as unimportant documents of course to become truly important such documents must come under the eye of an expert or of someone with a special interest in their contents to the uninitiated or uninterested it will seem forever unimportant the rosetta stone might readily have remained just a piece of rock had it not come to the attention of those who could because of training and interest comprehend its startling significance the stone which the builders refused is become the headstone of the corner and so in lesser degree of course every despised and neglected document has possibilities every one of them may have the quality the content that will make it for some earnest seeker after truth if not a rosetta stone if not a headstone of the corner at least a part of the material which under a master hand becomes a complete structure
