thie obligations and responsibilities of the librarian concerning censorship leon carnovsky i have never met a public librarian who approved of censorship or one who failed to practice it in some measure in some cases the practice was resented and adopted only in response to assumed or actual pressure in others it was accepted as proper and was justified on the score that no library can provide all books and that just as most books which have been published cannot be found in any single library so a library is forced to practice censorship in effect if not in name by failing to acquire the thousands and millions of books which it passes up for reasons of money space community interest or whatever cause first of all i should like to clear up the confusion behind this conception it is a confusion between book selection and censorship though the result may be the same in both nonprovision of a bookthe reasons are different and should be clearly recognized assume a typical public library in a middle western town of ten thousand run by a librarian doing the best he can to provide a wide assortment of literature the librarian sees a review of a history of persian art priced at oo but he quickly concludes that this book is not for him a decision obviously based on sound reasoning the elements in his reasoning are lack of potential interest cost possession of other books on the same general subject and the relative importance to the accomplishment of his objectives of this book as compared with half adozen others that he can buy for  then he sees an announcement in publishlers weekly of a new book by faith baldwin but he has always felt that the literary standards of his collection required a better quality of fiction therefore he does not even seriously consider the book much less order it next he reads about a book entitled studs lonigan it is well reviewed widely publicized inexpensive and a lot of people ask for it yet the librarian decides not to buy it though all three books are thus denied the potential borrower one would have to employ a highly specious logic to conclude that a censorship was operative in all three cases we must clearly distinguish between identical effects that result from altogether different causes and we shall never face the censorship problem squarely and honestly until we see that book selection which implies book rejection and censorship are not identical censorship is defined in the encyclopaedia of the social sciences as the policy of restricting the public expression of ideas opinions conceptions and impulses which have or are believed to have the capacity to undermine the governing authority or the social and moral order which that authority considers itself bound to protect it is a conscious policy and may be enforced without the assent of the majority indeed it may be  this paper was presented at the fourth annual library symposium kent state university kent ohio on may i i  encyclopaedia of the social sciences iii new york macmillan co   i
 the library quarterly instituted by a small group or even by an individual who feels strongly concerning a certain issue though such issues may fall in any sphere of human interest the practice of censorship has been most frequently invoked in three areas namely politics religion and morals and therefore it is in these areas that the problems of censorship as they impinge on library administration are most often encountered the theory of free speech in the political realm has been so thoroughly discussed that it seems a little strange that it should need a defense in i clearly and forthrightly expressed in the first amendment to the constitution copied and incorporated in some form in our state constitutions strongly supported by court decisions of the most respected and honored members of our judiciary it still remains an ever present issue to plague and puzzle us the reason is that freedom is not and can never be an absolute my freedomto make noise is directly contrary to your freedom to enjoy quiet nor can there be absolute freedom of speech society itself imposes limits upon it and it becomes the business of the courts to determine whether the limits have been transgressed in individual cases perhaps the clearest expression concerning free speech appears in our bill of rights congress shall make no law    abridging the freedom of speech or of the press and the finest explication of the free speech doctrine is to be found in john stuart mill essay on liberty little that has been written since adds much to his cogent argument his primary object in writing his essay was to establish the principle that the sole end for which mankind are warranted  in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self protection that the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community against his will is to prevent harm to others included in the sphere of liberty of action is the liberty of expressing and publishing opinions even though such expression goes beyond strictly individual concern and extends to other persons however says mill since expression of thought is so closely allied to freedom of thought itself it is practically inseparable from it the champions of free speech from milton through mill to justice holmes in our own day have all been much more concerned with the preservation of the right of free speech for the individualeven though he be the only person in the nation who believes what he believes indeed this is no more than the recognition of the fact that all progress in human affairs is possible only in an atmosphere which permits the unusual person who is frequently the unpopular person to get himself heard the harm in silencing sulch a person is only incidentally the harm to him the greater harm is to society which may be thus deprived of the opportunity to learn a possible truth of which only he may be the master the truth or wisdom of any issue like the nature of the good and the beautiful is never discerned by taking a vote majorities as such have force on their side but little else to silence a dissident is to solidify a position and thus to make less likely the possibility of change listen to mill on this point the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is that it is robbing the human race postcrity as well as the existing generation those who dissent from the opinion still more  john stuart mill on liberty boston atlantic monthly press  pp i   bidi p i 
the librarian and censorship  than those who hold it if the opinion is right they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth if wrong they lose what is almost as great a benefit the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth produced by its collision with error and again with even greater force i insist thus emphatically on the importance of genius and the necessity of allowing it to unfold itself freely both in thought and in practice being well aware that no one will deny the position in theory but knowing also that almost everyone in reality is totally indifferent to it people think genius a fine thing if it enables a man to write an exciting poem or paint a picture but in its true sense that of originality in thought and action though no one says that it is not a thing to be admired nearly all at heart think that they can do very well without it originality is the one thing which unoriginal minds cannot feel the use of this however is only one argument for free speech others are equally cogent mill mentions three first a suppressed opinion though false on the whole may yet contain certain elements of truth accepted or prevailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth it is only by collision of adverse opinions that the remainder of the truth has any chance of being supplied again even in the unlikely event that on any given issue the opinion we hold is the complete truth our confidence in it becomes more strongly intrenched as we see it in the light of lesser truths or even of false doctrines and finally says mill the meaning of the doctrine itself if it is never challenged may be lost and become a mere formal profession accepted from habit and not from conviction since the case for free speech is so solid in our historic tradition in our constitutional guaranties and in its logical persuasiveness it seems odd that the principle is continually being challenged and has been fought several times all the way up to the supreme court and yet it is not so odd for as we have said the concept of free speech is not an absolute and it is continually necessary for the courts to determine where free speech may become a menace to society or even to the achievement of short term goals which society through its legislatures may envisage the single most important case involving free speech is the famous schenck case heard before the supreme court here the decision of the supreme court was written by justice holmesnot a dissent but presenting the unanimous opinion of the court in june i and may ii congress enacted legislation aimed at controlling speech which might be construed as disloyal or seditious the defendants schenck and his associates had been found guilty in the lower courts of mailing circulars calculated to cause insubordination in the military forces the circulars declared conscription to be despotism and urged the conscriptees to obstruct its operation the defense invoked the free speech clause of the constitution and it is this aspect that makes the case important for us the statement of justice holmes in ruling on this point has been often quoted because it laid down a rule that comes close to furnishing a yardstick to drawing the line where the constitutional protection of free speech no longer applies said holmes we admit that in many places and in ordinary times the defendants in saying all that was said in the circular would have been within their constitutional rights but the character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic the question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that congress ibid p  lbid p go  ibid p 
 the library quarterly has a right to prevent it is a question of proximity and degree when a nation is at war many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight and that no court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right the key phrase in this decision is clear and present danger the problem still remains to determine when a publication or an act constitutes a danger to the state or to society but at least we have the right question even if we cannot always provide the right answer indeed even the supreme court was unable in applying the test to come out with a consistent answer this is most clearly shown in the abrams case also decided in i the year of the schenck decision abrams and his associates had strewed some leaflets from the roof of a building in new york these leaflets were not aimed at interfering with the war against germany but protested against american intervention in the russian revolution included in the protest was a call for a general strike this could be construed as interfering with the war against germany therefore the group was indicted no strike was actually called and there was no evidence that a single person had been moved to stop any kind of war work as a result of the leaflets nevertheless the defendants were found guilty in the district court and the sentence imposed was upheld by a   vote of the supreme court the great importance of this case for us lies in the dissenting opinion of justice holmes concurred in by justice brandeis in this opinion holmes further develops the clear and present danger principle he strikingly shows how strongly he has been influenced by both milton and mill his statement has been said to be the greatest utterance on intellectual freedom by an american and ranking with the areopagitica and the essay on libertyio persecution for the expression of opinions seems to me perfectly logical if you have no doubt of your premises or your power and want a certain result with all your heart you naturally express your wishes in law and sweep away all opposition to allow opposition by speech seems to indicate that you think the speech impotent as when a man says that he has squared the circle or that you do not care wholeheartedly for the result or that you doubt either your power or your premises but when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out that at any rate is the theory of our constitution it is an experiment as all life is an experiment every year if not every day we have to wager our salvation upon some prophecy based upon imperfect knowledge while that experiment is part of our system i think that we should be eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death unless they so imminently threaten immediate interference with the lawful and pressing purposes of the law that an immediate check is required to save the country only the emergency that makes it immediately dangerous to leave the correction of evil counsels to time warrants making any exception to the sweeping command congress shall make no law    abridging the freedom of speech i hope the implications for libraries of what i have said have not been lost if there is one agency above all which has  schenck v united states  united states reports  ii  abrams v united states  united states reports i  i lo max lerner ed the mind and faith of justice holmes his speeches essays letters and judicial opinions boston little brown  co i p

 the library quarterly and the great interest in free speech should be sacrificed only when the interest in public safety is really imperiled and not  when it is barely conceivable that it may be slightly affected this is especially true in peacetime we next turn to free speech as it applies to religion a subject on which we tend to be more sensitive than on any other criticism of one most personal spinrtual beliefs is bad manners at the least it may become a serious nuisance as it was when jehovah witnesses hired loudspeakers to condemn publicly the members or tenets of other faiths as a result many communities passed ordinances requiring licenses for the use of sound trucks jehovah witnesses however ignored this legislation and continued berating other creeds they were arrested prosecuted and eventually appealed their case to the supreme court on the grounds that such licensing requirement constituted an abridgment of free speech the court by a   vote sustained the witnesses and the ordinance designed to curb the overexuberant preachings of this sect was declared unconstitutional an even clearer case is that of lovell a jehovah witness v griffin ga where it was held by justice hughes speaking for a unanimous court that an ordinance requiring written permission from the city manager for the distribution of literature of any kind was unconstitutional whatever the motive which induced its adoption said hughes its character is such that it strikes at the very foundation of the freedom of the press by subjecting it to license and censorship it should be noted that free speech was the issue in both these cases not criticism of religion this issue was not even raised just as it is legally proper to criticize agnosticism paganism atheism or any other negative form of religion so it is proper to criticize its positive forms judaism catholicism or any of the branches of protestantism interference with the right to criticize religions has been a serious library problem only sporadically in a few localities christian scientists objected to edward dakin biography of mary baker eddy published by scribner in the i and you are undoubtedly familiar with the strenuous objection raised in new york and a few other places to the nation series of articles by paul blanshard in which he criticized certain aspects of the catholic church in neither case did the issue reach the courts for the right of publication guaranteed in the constitution was too patent yet in both cases pressures were brought against libraies and some censorship resulted censorship of the blanshard articles in the nation took a particularly serious form in new york for not only were the issues containing the offensive articles removed from school library shelves but subscnrptions to the periodical were canceled at the direction of the superintendent of schools we find here an implied threat against any periodical that may contemplate the publication of any article to which some powerful and numerous group might take exception it seems unnecessary to stress the library responsibilities in this delicate area the right to criticize religion must not be abrogated any more than the parallel right to criticize social or political beliefs we plainly have the right to look critically at any religion and members of a religious group lay themselves open to suspicion if they attempt to deny to any zechariah chafee jr free speech in the united staes cambridge harvard university press i p  saia v people of the state of new york  united states reports ss  xs lovei v griffin  united states reports  g
the librarian and censorship  one this right the answer to free speech is more free speech not its obliteration serious discussion of the beliefs or operations of any established church is surely proper material for a public library in spite of the dangers of censorship of political and social ideas it is in the area of morals that librarians have experienced the greatest difficulty both from external interference and from the nature of the decision concerning the line between morality and immorality strictly speaking it is not morality that introduces the problem but such concepts as obscenity pornography filth or whatever other synonyms one prefers here too as in political censorship the first amendment is invariably invoked by the publisher or author whose book is objected to he may claim that the book is not obscene or less frequently he may argue that the free speech principle confers an unlimited right and that considerations of obscenity are irrelevant however we clearly have the right to legislate against the distribution of filth and in one notable case united states v limehouse the supreme court upheld such a right one limehouse had written letters which the court characterized as coarse vulgar disgusting indecent and unquestionably filthy within the popular meaning of that term does this type of thing create a clear and present danger it would be difficult to prove this yet justice brandeis took the position that congress had the right to punish the distribution of filth it will be recognized that this was not the sort of free speech the founding fathers had in mind when drawing up the first amendment it has nothing to do with arriving at truth or rational decisions on the basis of conflicting ideas of presenting evidence for a point of view or even of propagandizing for or against action construed in the public interest the suppression of such speech harms no one but the individual suppressed his right to be obscene is curbed in the interest of a larger right that of the rest of us to be saved from his obscenities chafee has likened this to the curb we place on an individual to prevent his smoking in streetcars the injury in both cases is immediate in the discomfort caused the nonsmokers and in the shock to the sensitive listener and reader free speech does not include license or licentiousness the clear and present danger test cannot here be invoked to draw the line between the permissible and the proscribedi this however is only the beginning and the simplest part of the problem the major question remains that of an operational rather than of a dictionary definition of obscenity this has turned out to be a matter of extraordinary difficulty and it has been treated with little consistency from one court to another frequently the decision seems to have been based on hunch or intuition at any rate without the spelling out of a definition acceptable to other judges to publishers or to librarians we speak glibly about ours being a nation governed by laws but laws are not only made by men they are also interpreted by men and one man interpretation is different from another hence the vast number of dissenting opinions in obscenity cases as well as in others historically american and british law has tended to rely on the definition provided by lord chief justice cockburn in i in ruling against a pamphlet entitled the confessional unmasked i think the test of obscenity is this whetha united states v limehouse  united states reports  i  zechariah chafee jr government and mass communications chicago university of chicago press i

 the library quarterly chafee suggests how much frankness the community will stand this i frankly do not like it seems to substitute one difficulty for another without solving the basic problem the community itself is difficult to define is it a region a city or a neighborhood is it the majority of adults and if so how do we know what they will accept if we cannot depend on majorities whose level shall be accepted as representing the community that of a well read minority or of a poorly read superficial majority or something in between under the circumstances our best solution is probably the one judge woolsey hit upon to rely upon the judgment of intelligent readers and to expect them to be as liberal as possible in making their decision there is far less danger to the community however defined in permitting questionable literature to be published and read than there is in a strict definition of obscenity that would deny access to such literature after all what is the real objection are the censors afraid that we will be offended by books like studs lonigan if there be any among us who would be offended the solution is simple and readily at hand we can close the book happily the freedom to read implies the freedom to desist from reading but many of us will not desist and that is what the censor truly fears not that we will be offended but that we will be pleased where does this leave the library shall the library provide books which some courts notably in massachusetts have ruled obscene shall it consider as unacceptable books that have actually been cleared by the courts and what about the large mass of books that never come to the courts at all in fact it is this group that may cause the library the most heart searching and even embarrassment the library cannot wait for a test case to be brought to trial yet it must make its decision shortly after publication my answer would be that in the first case where the courts have ruled a book obscene it all depends on which court if it is a state or municipal court we need take its ruling seriously only when our library is within the jurisdiction of the ordinance on which the court acts there is no reason for a library in ohio to remove strange fruit from its collection merely because a massachusetts court considered it obscene in the second case where a book has been cleared by the courts that is a point in its favor although there may be other good and sufficient reasons why it may be rejected by the library a book should have more to commend it than the mere absence of dirt before it is judged legitimate library bookstock as for the third case where we cannot look to the courts for guidance i believe we must depend on some such test as that which judge woolsey applied here the librarian himself must be the judge and he should apply his best efforts toward determining whether the book in question taken as a whole is to be considered obscene in making his decision he should give the benefit of the doubt to the book presumably it is not dirt for dirt sake like most books it is not likely to lead the reader to sexual excesses or immorality it is not likely to give offense to the normal reader because of its language or frank descriptions if the librarian like judge woolsey wishes  chafee governmentt and mass communications i i  the objection which the watch and ward society makes to many of the books it wishes to suppress is not that these books offend readers but that they delight them  the true fear of the censor is that the ideas set forth will in the long run undermine our present system of marriage and morality ibid p 
the librarian and censorship i to check his judgment against that of others he may call on literate citizens at large whose judgment he trusts for an opinion they too should be very slow to rule against a book and in judging its possible effect on the library readers they should certainly not take as the norm the adolescent or immature adult nor should they give undue weight to the probability that the book will offend some people most important of all they should never lose sight of the fact of which chafee reminds us that stamping on a fire often spreads the sparks that many past suppressions are now considered ridiculous that the communication of ideas is just as important in this field as in any other and that healthy human minds have a strong natural resistance to emotional poisons s remember that whitman leaves of grass was at one time considered unfit to be read remember too that books like the naked and the dead and the young lions would probably not have found a publisher twenty years ago but are today listed among the notable books of i yet even with all these precautions some people will protest they may be a church group a superpatriotic society or even one or two individuals the protest may be lodged against books in the political or social realm or against a novel it may take the form of mere objection or it may become an ugly threat against the library or its librarian even more impor tant perhaps is the fear of such objection a fear that oftener than we think may lead a librarian or library board to rule out certain books to avoid an embarrassing situation which may develop in short to deprive the potential and interested reader rather than take a chance on someone objection such objection is thought to create bad public relations though we should remember that equally bad public relations may develop by failing to provide certain books let us analyze this situation for a moment taking the matter of a potential objection first we might as well recognize that this is an ever present possibility we can never escape the chance that someone may feel unhappy about a particular book yet i think that in an overwhelming number of cases where a library has actually obtained the book no protest developed at all fear of protest usually turns out to be a straw man but suppose that a protest is lodged should it be taken seriously enough to withdraw the book we must consider the nature of the book and the nature of the protestant if the book was seriously weighed in the light of its quality and of library policy and was acquired because it met the standards imposed by the library i see no reason for its withdrawal as for the protestant does he represent a sufficiently numerous citizenry or is he speaking solely for himself or for a special group even if the librarian were to decide on the basis of numbers why should he assume that more people would object to the book than would welcome it or would at least be indifferent to its provision we hear a great deal these days about the need to protect minorities particularly their right to free speech and assembly but in protecting minority rights we must be careful to distinguish between the right to express and the right to dominate majorities also have their rights no minority should abuse its privilege so as to shackle the majority what right permits any minority racial national or religious tacitly to say to the rest of the community you shall not read this book in assuring minori ibd p is
