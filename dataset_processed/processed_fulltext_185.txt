the interdependence of knowledge and information in the world today malurice b visscher fact that a conference should be held to consider international asi pects of library functions is significant in several respects to a scientist the principle of universality of scientific knowledge seems so self evident that it seems nearly impossible that it could be doubted yet there are many forces at work in the world which are operating to make the international exchange of information difficult the librarian is usually acutely aware of these problems nevertheless it may be of interest to professional librarians to consider the difficulties from the viewpoint of the professional scientist it is not my intention to deal at length with the technical aspects of bibliographic control because many librarians are better qualified for that task my own experiences in connection with the work of biological abstracts and with the activities of unesco in the scientific literature field have brought me in close contact with the practical problems of the dissemination of scientific knowledge and of information about knowledge nevertheless my primary interest has been in the broader objectives rather than in the mechanics of such dissemination the present day problem of scholars and librarians arises from several causes the first and central core problem lies in the gigantic growth of scientific literature within the last century figure  presents a graph showing the rise in the rate of publication of scientific communications since  the numbers given are estimates but it is unlikely that the figures carry an erroneous implication the important point to note is the obviously exponential nature of the growth curve every science librarian knows this story well from practical experience shelf space necessary for storage of scientific literature in many libraries is said to double every fifteen years the scientific enterprise is a relatively new feature in human history and we at mid twentieth century have no reason to believe that we have seen its full flower in the united states no estimate of research outlay places the figure at more than  per cent of the national income even this figure includes a major fraction in the category of development and control rather than bona fide investigation it would not be surprising if the years ahead saw a continuation of the present geometric progression in volume of research publication because one cannot see a valid reason for deliberate limitation of research support at its present level to be sure there are romantic souls who are urging a moratorium on research until our standards of moral behavior catch up with our advances in knowledge but at the same moment new millions of dollars pounds rubles and pesos are being appropriated for research on novel and more deadly weapons there is in other words no sign of a slowdown even in the field of research for destruction and as to the areas of research in 
 the library quarterly science related to health agriculture and peacetime industry there are very few signs of a recession the largest limiting factor today in the united states is not money but scientific manpower there may be a limit near the present level in manpower but it must be pointed out that several factors extraneous to interest in science are mainly responsible for the current lag in recruitment for careers in science the unfavorable salary scales are deterrents as is the current policy regarding military service for young men both these factors are capable of alteration the mountains of publications which constitute the present output of research workers are already so overwhelming that few scholars are able to search the world literature in their fields of research with any degree of confidence in the completeness of the result furthermore in any field that is not very recently opened the labor involved is so time consuming that the task often becomes a major occupation for months or years at the present time with one of my colleagues i am preparing a critical review of the literature on a very small physiological topic pulmonary edema we have identified in three months about fifteen hundred relevant references and are in the process of scanning the papers and studying those which appear to us to be important there have been a dozen fragmentary reviews of this topic in the last decade but we find that some of the most important papers are not men i growth in scientific publications  from citations by j murray luck  a i   no i ilc     u i f a  a   amfg
interdependence of knowledge and information  tioned and especially we have found that many of the more important contributions are not abstracted or indexed under headings identifying them as being relevant i mention this personal experience primarily to stress the point that much scientific information is at present buried in the libraries of the very institutions in which people are as busy as bees repeating the same studies and spending precious years rediscovering established facts even more deplorable is the failure to take the established facts imto account in planning studies on facets of problems indirectly related to them for this reason the new studies are not so well oriented as they could be although the volume of publication today is the central fact in the difficulty in searching out scientific data and reasoning therefrom there are other important difficulties one of these is the language problem until three centuries ago scholars used classical latin for their communications for most of the intervening time french german and english were the main media of scientific intercourse but in the last half century increasingly large numbers of increasingly important contributions are being presented in other languages the trend today is toward more rather than less use of other languages the rise of nationalism in the world could scarcely have any other result it may be a bright ideal to wish that every scholar might be equipped to read in all languages in which literature is published in his or her field but it becomes pure fantasy when such literature appears in a half dozen slavic languages and in several oriental romance germanic and near eastern tongues there are some xenophobes who have said that nothing in languages strange to them is worth reading but the facts are otherwise to take some recent examples stereovectorelectrocardiography was developed in japan and published about extensively in chinese characters in  in  and since hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent in the united states by scholars who did not learn of the japanese work until  after they had repeated much of it unnecessarily another example is the development of blood banks the first demonstration that stored blood could be used safely for transfusion purposes was published in russian in the early thirties this work came to the notice of western european and american students of the problem some years later and provided the impetus for further studies which have made the expression blood bank common usage and have saved hundreds of thousands of human lives absolute unfamiliarity with a language is unfortunately not the only bar to international exchange of information in many countries with currency control or severe budget limitations the purchase of foreign publications is sharply limited furthermore there are differences in common or traditional habits of thought and expression which make it difficult to comprehend the thoughtprocesses of persons from entirely different cultural backgrounds or if the thought is comprehended it is often rejected summarily as incompletely established and therefore worthless scientists are in other words not entirely free from parochialism but the most important contributor to the sin of chauvinism is i believe something still more practical scientists may live in an international intellectual world but they also live in a very national practical world scientists and other scholars in general need salaried jobs to
 the library quarterly live to get such jobs and to get promotion they must have the respect first and foremost of their own countrymen the national and regional character of most scientific meetings also contributes to the greater interest in and familiarity with the work of near by colleagues than with that of students in other regions thus many factors combine to discourage full awareness of contributions to knowledge from abroad language barriers lack of funds to buy the less frequently used publications cultural idiosyncrasies career motivations and propinquity conspire to make us provincial to the disadvantage of both the utilization and the progress of knowledge how real this provincialism is can be seen readily from a compilation i have made of citations in two important journals in my own field in table  you will see statistics from the may  issues of the american journal of physiology and the journal of physiology london england in the american journal  per cent of the citations are to united states publications only  per cent are to publications outside the united states and the british commonwealth among these are several multilingual journals so that the foreign language citations are about  per cent although a qualitative evaluation of the amount of important foreign language publication is difficult it is not plausible that the ratio is  in english to  in all other languages as to volume of publications the ratio is not known with certainty but my guess would be about  to  one cannot do more than guess because the slavic and chinese literature is largely unavailable to us in the united states since in  at the time of the international physiological congress in moscow it was claimed that there were one thousand members of the physiological society of the ussr a number considerably larger than the membership at that time of the american physiological society one might expect a fairly large volume of publication in the russian language moreover the scandinavian german swiss latin american dutch belgian italian japanese israeli spanish and turkish physiological scientists are all productive some very highly so particularly among the first seven mentioned the british journal statistics are slightly different a slightly higher per cent of citations are to journals from nonenglish speaking countries but a much larger share of references are to united states publications than was true of references to british publications in the american journal a part of the apparent provincialism might be due to the fact table  references to literature in two current journals american journal of journal of physiology physiology may  london may  no of papers in issue     total no of citations    per paper   per paper total no of citations to american literature   per paper     per paper total no of citations to british commonwealth literature      per paper    per paper total no of citations to all other literature    per paper    per paper per cent with no citations to other literature   
interdependence of knowledge and information  that interest may center on particular problems in a country on occasion but on looking at the subject matter i did not see that this was a plausible explanation the subjects treated were those undergoing study in various parts of the world  conclude that the language barrier and a conscious or unconscious chauvinism are important factors in regard to the language problem and the availability of the publications there is more to be said indexing and abstracting services do provide some degree of coverage of foreign language literature in most areas of science the unesco scientific abstracting conference report in  accepted one third as the fraction of scientific papers published which are abstracted in some way presumably there had been considerable selection and the papers deemed more important are concentrated in those abstracted some light has been shed on the question of the completeness of abstracting endeavors by a study sponsored by the committee for the survey of the physiological sciences of the american physiological society an analysis was made of the countries of origin and the coverage in abstract journals of  papers bearing on the cerebral circulation published in  in physiological reviews of the total number of papers published in a  year period referred to in this bibliography  per cent originated in the united states  per cent came from british commonwealth countries and the remainder from other parts of the world some of the details of this study are shown in table  it will be apparent that the percentage of the papers arising in various countries abstracted in abstract journals published in the united states ranged from  to  per cent as might be expected the largest percentage was for united states papers although this may be most understandable in terms of the mechanics of operation of abstracting journals it is not necessarily the most advantageous as regards the provision of information for scholars and persons who may wish to apply the knowledge in question the journals from eastern europe and the orient are in general the most difficult to gain access to in the original and therefore it might be much more important to have adequate abstracting of papers from those countries likewise in the case of western europe where the papers are published mainly in german and french the per cent coverage by united states abstracting agencies was very low even when one considers papers abstracted by any of the four major services in the world at large the percentage of table  cerebral circulation united b western eastern latin states wealth europe europe america wealth no of papers         per cent of total     s   per cent abstracted in us        no abstracted by  major services         per cent abstracted         rearranged from survey of physiological sciences report of pilot phase   papers  year bibliography 
 the library quarterly all papers covered is only  it is of some interest to note that the highest percentage coverage is for papers arising in the british commonwealth and the lowest those from latin america a part of this difference may possibly be due to a qualitative evaluation of the importance of the contributions from various parts of the world but it is unlikely that this is the entire explanation another way of looking at the problem is to consider the distribution as to national origin of papers which are abstracted in a large service such a study table  sample analysis of biological abstracts coverage country of origin no in of original article sample per cent united states    british commonwealth   france    japan     germany   switzerland    scandinavia    india   holland     italy     argentina    ussr    all others  countries    based on an  per cent random sample of  abstracts published by biological abstracts in  based on data from bentley glass survey is being made by dr bentley glass for biological abstracts excerpts from his data are shown in table  here it will be seen that nearly half of all abstracts are of united states papers  per cent from the british commonwealth and considerably smaller percentages from any other country these results can be explained in part by the policies of the abstracting journal a large number of united states publications supply author abstracts to biological abstracts very few journals from other countries do so the very low figures from the ussr for example are related in part at least to poor availability from that country in the united states nevertheless in spite of factors which would tend to bias the results in favor of united states and english language journals it is significant that  per cent of all material in biological abstracts arose from nonenglish speaking countries in  it is my opinion that if the biasing factors were eliminated the proportion from the non english speaking world would rise to considerably more than  per cent it will i believe be obvious from these data that at the present time foreign contributions to the scientific literature as judged by the examples i have given are very large it would be unwise to attempt to evaluate the relative importance of papers appearing from one or another country such evaluations are difficult at best and even if they are valid at a given point in history one is not justified in assuming that the same situation will continue indefinitely most physiologists would i believe agree that in the first quarter of the present century british physiologists were making many contributions of the first order of importance many physiologists would also agree that within the last quarter century extremely important developments have been made in britain and the commonwealth nations merely to mention the names of adrian sherrington barcroft hopkins and hill among others active during the last quarter century will bring from physiologists general recognition of the merit of their work and right at the present moment the british school of investigators of the chemistry of nerve fiber function is making important history but many physiologists today might
interdependence of knowledge and information  consider that the scandinavian group is at present making the most fundamental contributions by virtue of the studies of such investigators as tiselius linderstrom lang ussing hevesy and lundsgaard to name a few however in many instances it is really impossible to credit a single national group with anything like full credit for major developments for example one may take the brilliant new discoveries in the field of muscle chemistry they started with the discovery of an enzymatic function of myosin by the russian physiologist engelhardt great progress was made by the hungarian szent gydrgyi other important work was done by cori in the united states and research on these problems is being prosecuted actively in belgium sweden britain and elsewhere thus the newer knowledge of the function of muscle proteins in relation to the contractile process might be taken as a perfect example of the importance of international co operation in an important area of science if walls had existed between the several countries that i have mentioned with respect to the flow of scientific knowledge it is virtually a certainty that world knowledge in the field would be very much less than it is today besides the current situation it is not without importance to consider the reservoirs of knowledge in the literature of science there are many millions of scientific papers collecting dust in the libraries of the world by no means all the meat has been extracted from scientific papers that are ten twenty or more years old it is not only the scientific historian and the student of the philosophy and logic of science who are interested in the older literature it is true that with improvements in methodology much older literature becomes obsolete because more accurate observations have been made however there are many areas of science in which the methods of study have not changed so appreciably over the years and in which older observational data are quite as accurate as the new in such areas buried knowledge is a very real waste when one considers the national origins of information over the last hundred years one finds that the united states and the english speaking world generally have made much smaller relative contributions than at present i noted above that one of my associates and i have been preparing a review on the subject of pulmonary edema in table  appear the table  pulmonary edema placie of publication united british other states commoncountries wealth number     per cent of total      literature search by f j haddy and m b visscher made in  analysis of  references selected at random from total of  results of an analysis of the origin of this material the percentages may not hold exactly for other subjects in the field of physiology or in other sciences but it is likely that the figures would not be different in principle here it appears that almost two thirds of the literature relevant to this subject has arisen in non englishspeaking countries certainly if one is to tap the reservoirs of information now stored in our libraries it is completely impossible to ignore the contributions from the non english speaking world another interesting facet of the problem of international exchange of informa
 the library quarterly tion is the extent to which foreign readers use our journals i have tabulated in table  some of the current data regarding subscriptions to biologwal a bstracts as might be expected united states subscriptions made up more than half the list but the striking fact is the large number of foreign subscribers forty five non english speaking countries are on the list obviously the scientists in those countries are demanding the best that there is available in world coverage of literature in the biological sciences table s current subscriptions to biologcal abstracts by countries country no country no united states  germany   british comholland   monwealth  brazil    scandinavia    belgium   japan   hungary  italy   switzerland  india    argentina  france   all others   russia   i have tried to present some factual data which i believe may provide a basis for valid discussion the world literature in science has grown and very probably will continue to grow at a staggering pace in spite of the fact that a somewbat larger fraction of the total output of publications seems to be arising from the united states at the present time it would be rank nonsense to suggest that united states scientists could afford to ignore the contributions from the rest of the world very few scientists in fact hold such a naive view but many scientists act much as though they did this is evidenced by our failure to cite publications from other countries by our failure to abstract and index as completely the literature from other countries as from our own and by the decreasing emphasis that is being placed in graduate education in the united states today on training in the foreign languages however if it is our complaint that it is difficult to keep up with the foreign literature it would be an even more justified complaint to point out that it is difficult to keep up with domestic literature it is really impossible to think about the problem of making fuller use of scientific information from abroad without considering the general problem of making better use of all scientific information i therefore suggest that one reconsider the implications of the phenomenal rise in world scientific output it is becoming such a task to review even relatively small segments of the literature of science that productive investigators are becoming more and more reluctant to devote the time necessary to it reviews covering a thousand scientific papers cannot be made without the expenditure of several thousands of hours thus it becomes increasingly unlikely that in the future critical reviews will be undertaken by many active research workers this time has not yet arrived because there is as yet no satisfactory mechanism to replace the critical review nevertheless as the labor becomes more arduous than it is at present the problem of finding suitable authors for critical reviews will become more and more difficult there is no obvious solution to all the problems involved in interand intranational exchange of scientific information it might be and has been suggested that an optimal solution would be for interested persons to work at the problem of improving bibliographic services in their own countries unfortunately however services of this sort do not by themselves in a given country meet the
interdependence of knowledge and information  needs of scientists in those countries let us consider for a moment what would happen to biological abstracts if it abandoned abstracting material from foreign countries it would almost certainly have to abandon publication because it would not be serving a sufficiently useful function for its subscribers the very fact that no such abstracting journal has ever been proposed is silent testimony to the recognition of the crucial importance of international exchange of information in science as a responsible officer of such an abstracting agency i would never consider jeopardizing its present usefulness by such a move unless and until a working plan was in operation to bring abstracts from foreign sources to the subscribers and users of the abstract journal in question having had some little contact with the financial and operational problems of a bibliographic service i believe that no ultimately satisfactory service to the students of science and the consumers of scientific knowledge will be possible on the basis of subscription income from libraries and individuals a modest compromise with the ideal is being made on the basis of such financing but this compromise leaves much to be desired from many viewpoints for example the scholar is unhappy with the incompleteness of coverage making it impossible for him to locate knowledge that exists without exorbitant expenditures of time everyone including the public that pays for research should be unhappy about the waste in funds resulting from ignorance of existing knowledge librarians are justified in being unhappy too over their inability to lay their hands on material that may be of importance to their consuming public in all the conferences on scientific documentation which have been held in reoent years many of them under the impetus of unesco there has been one point about which there has been universal agreement the present situation with regard to scientific bibliographic control is unsatisfactory there has also been agreement with regard to some principles of procedure as to improvement there has been no agreement that has resulted in any great practical amelioration of our present problem it is not hard to understand why the question of a major solution is unsolved two difficulties stand in the way first there is no agreement as to what an optimal mechanism for scientific communication might be the second difficulty lies in the fact that no one sees exactly where the financial subsidy would come from to implement any satisfactory solution the first of these two problems is in my opinion the more difficult this is true because it would require a prophet to know what is going to happen to such an important thing as the volume of scientific publication in the next ten years furthermore no one can predict what advantages may accrue from new electrical and mechanical mechanisms of identification and correlation of nformation however we live in a real world in which we have to accept compromises and improvisations we have to do with what is good if we cannot get what is best thus as a pragmatist i advocate that we keep on improving our present machinery until a definitely superior machine is available and operating to do the job we want done therefore i believe we must perfect existing types of abstracting and indexing procedures at the same time that we move in the direction of trying to develop more adequate ones work in the field of scientific docu
 the library quarterly mentation is a specialty which should receive more and more encouragement because as the literature problems acquire greater magnitude it will be increasingly essential that the persons who index scientific papers will not contribute to their being lost by failing to recognize the categories in which they should be mentioned in order to make foreign literature valuable it will be necessary for such bibliographic experts to be not only familiar with the science in question but also accomplished linguists all too frequently one finds evidence of complete misunderstanding based upon language difficulties in scientific bibliography one topic pertinent to this discussion i have deliberately omitted until the more basic problems have been dealt with i wish now to refer briefly to the complications which military policy and necessity and political expediency bring into the picture i have deferred their introduction until now because they bring in special considerations not germane to the central problem in the real world of tension today one cannot seriously doubt the necessity for secrecy about some aspects of applied science there is however room for grave doubt as to whether the limitations which have been placed on the free circulation of the basic science knowledge so restricted have been justified or wise much information which was known to be in the hands of nations unfriendly to the united states has for example been unavailable to most united states citizens thus we simply deprive ourselves of the possible advantages of knowledge to no good purpose whatsoever even in the cases where basic knowledge is possessed uniquely by one national group there is doubt that its interest is served by secrecy this is true because if a very small group of scholars have access to information the chance of further developments diminishes with the size of the infonmed group scientific discovery depends upon many factors no two scholars approach problems with exactly the same background information and training the educated hunch that leads one to a fruitful solution does not occur to every equally competent scholar i have no doubt that hundreds of bacteriologists saw the same effects of culture contamination by molds that led sir alexander fleming to his discovery of penicillin and that their only reaction was one of exasperation over a spoiled plate but out of a unique constellation of information and logic in fleming came the greatest boon to humanity through medical science that our times have seen but fleming did not eventually make a fruitful discovery alone he had the assistance of scholars trained in fields in which he was unfamiliar who made his basic discovery practically useful there were very many minds and laboratories that were essential to the development of antibiotics to the point of usefulness they have today and there can be no reasonable doubt that the future holds new and more important developments in store if there is free exchange of knowledge so that many minds may be applied to the problems these points need stress because the layman does not in general perceive the great importance of free exchange of basic information to scientific progress even in military affairs but the point that i believe is most important is that the political climate in tense times tends to make people think that security is necessarily bound up with secrecy in science for example work on penicillin was secret during world war ii i fail to find any valid justification for such a classification and i believe that political
interdependence of knowledge and information  rather than national defense considerations necessitated such classification fear and other emotions cloud judgment especially when full information is lacking there is also another side to the coin to be examined in connection with national secrecy not only is it disadvantageous to scientific progress in a nation to hold basic knowledge secret but such action also has extremely adverse effects upon public opinion abroad just as fear breeds secrecy so secrecy breeds fear and with it dislike the human being ordinarily responds to trust by being trustworthy he ordinarily responds to treatment as an equal by reciprocation there are of course exceptions there are psychopathic personalities in every race and every nation in some unfortunately the psychopaths have great power we in the united states have a great problem on our hands to make sure that psychopathic personalities do not exploit our national troubles by unreasonable and unwise restrictions on the intraand international exchange of knowledge this must be prevented in order to protect our own future progress and safety and also to improve the attitudes which are rapidly deteriorating of foreigners toward our country in the scientific enterprise there is no doubt that we live in one world it is to be sure perverted in spots the ideological sphere that is this one world is in parts defective just as the earth is but there is no national monopoly on brains or ideas there are of course cultural differences in the cultivation of scientific manpower and production the history of science to date would have been a very different one and a tragic one if science had been confined within national bounds we cannot guess about the future without taking into account our knowledge of the past if we do propose to make some such guesses we may presume i believe with safety that great advantage will accrue to the science and to the people of every country if mechanisms are improved for the free exchange of scientific information and knowledge we must sharpen and strengthen the tools we now have but we must also be bold in experimenting with new methods calculated to meet more effectively the needs of the decades to come when existing tools may become as outmoded as the oxcart in the days of jet propulsion
