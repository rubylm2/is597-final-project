paper impermanence as a consequence of ph and storage conditions richard daniel smith introduction t he weakened condition of books and the speed with which library collections are deteriorating concern all librarians many know that alum has been used by papermakers for many years to precipitate rosin sizes and that hydrogen ions derived from alum are a major cause of paper deterioration most librarians may not appreciate that other sources provide a sufficient number of hydrogen ions to destroy paper and that alum was used intentionally for hundreds of years to preserve paper storage conditions particularly excessive bookstack temperatures can destroy otherwise permanent papers this article aims to provide some basic information references to further information and a sense of proportion about the action of hydrogen ions and storage conditions on paper other important causes of paper deterioration such as oxidative degradation biological attack photocatalyzed degradation and mechanical wear and tear will not be considered at this time the causes of book deterioration can be examined in two ways according to the causes over which librarians exercise little or no control or according to the causes over which librarians could exercise much if not complete control this study is particularly interested in the improvements in paper permanence to which librarians can contribute it assumes that librarians do not control the manufacture of books or book components such as paper the storage of a book before its arrival at the library or the manner in which a borrower treats a book but they are responsible for storage conditions in their libraries hydrolytic degradation of cellulose in paper fibers as catalyzed by hydrogen ions is accepted as the most important cause of book paper deterioration in most libraries the rate of deterioration normally increases with a decrease in the ph value increase in acidity of a water extract of any paper the rate of this deterioration given a constant ph is largely determined by the temperature and the relative humidity which controls the moisture content in the library bookstacks a number of recent publications          discuss the deterioration andor preservation of library materials and provide access to further sources of information browning and wink     are studying the prediction of paper permanence and accept the general validity of accelerated aging tests for estimating the permanence of paper they stress however that   nonuniformity of paper  variability of test results from conventional methods of paper testing and  lack of knowledge about use and storage conditions preclude an accurate estimate of exdected life  papermakers alum aso  h aso   h or a mixture of these hydrates came into widespread use in the paper industry about   p  the early product probably contained free sulfuric acid and substantial quantities of iron sulfate the alum roman alum used by earlier papermakers was potassium alum ekso  as  h both alums are acridic 
 the library quarterly much of the acidity in the paper of library books occurs as a consequence of manufacturing operations primarily alum rosin sizing other sources of acidity include acidic gases taken up from polluted storage atmospheres and the natural deterioration products of book and paper components some understanding of the relative importance of these sources of acidity as well as of the influence of storage conditions is desirable it is useful therefore to consider certain aspects of nineteenthand twentieth century paper manufacture air pollution and library storage practices nineteenth century beginnings the paper industry was in a state of crisis at the beginning of the nineteenth century the quantity of paper fibers available was insufficient to meet the demands for paper paper mills occasionally closed for lack of cotton and linen rags rags were a strategic material and governments took steps to maintain supplies so critical was the need that it was unpatriotic in england and germany to use cotton and linen garments for burying the dead  p  burial garments were made from wool fibers which were unsuited for papermaking this shortage of raw materials called for changes in methods of papermaking john murray a scottish lecturer and writer is frequently cited  pp    p   p   pp     p     p   p  to support the contention that deleterious changes in papermaking practices commenced in the early  initially in  murray  looked backward he did not weigh the alleged sacrifices in paper quality against the general social benefit of more paper for more books simmonds  p  in his  paper on the utilization of waste substances told of two pioneering contributions by murray one  was the descriptive account of the palo de vaca or cow tree of the caracas  printed on paper made from musa textilis abaca or manila hemp in the other  an account of the phormium tenax or new zealand flax printed on paper made of its leaves with a postscript on paper  murray emphasized overbleaching and poor quality of raw materials as more serious causes of deterioration than excessive acidity  pp   murray recommendation  p  to use syrup of violets to determine whether excessive acidity existed in paper had real merit b l browning senior research associate institute of paper chemistry appleton wisconsin suggests that anthocyanins in the syrup of violets acted as a ph indicator that shifted from red to blue or vice versa at about a ph of  while the references cited above properly credit murray for recognizing excessive acidity and overbleaching as causes of deterioration they fail to report that he enumerated other causes of paper deterioration and that some of his speculations were wide of the mark it seems desirable therefore to obtain another opinion about papermaking in the early  and to inquire whether scholars were concerned in even earlier times about the impermanence of paper speaking before the royal institution on february   cowper expressed an understanding of papermaking publishing and the dissemination of knowledge it is economy of production which must introduce an improved article into general use it is comparatively of little importance to have

 the library quarterly kinds of acid in the fumes of coal gas lamps apparently the correspondents were talking about two different kinds of illuminating gas  the raw product and  a refined product from which the sulfur gases had been removed  these letters are important because their arguments indicate that mid nineteenth century technology was greatly different from that practiced today in  irvine and woodhead summarized developments in the preceding few decades by way of their introduction to on the presence in paper of residual chemicals used in its preparation the simultaneous removal of excise restriction from the manufacture of paper and the publication of newspapers form an era in the victorian age and the effect which followed was marked by the great increase of newspapers and their circulation causing an extraordinary demand for increased supplies of paper thirty years ago  most if not all of the paper produced in great britain was manufactured from rags the process then obtaining being the homely one of boiling with weak leys sic of soda followed by use of bleaching materials in very limited amount paper was then practically made up of pure fiber interwoven or felted together now cheap papers are a peculiar compound of china clay stucco and resin held together by a skeleton of fibrous material obtained from wood esparto grass or straw from which the fibre is eliminated only by drastic and costly chemical treatment had these new materials not been at hand the rag supply of the world would have been insufficient to meet the present wants of great britain alone as a natural consequence paper fell in price and the expensive chemical operations necessitated the use of cheap loading materials as compensation whilst the careful but tedious washing of the fibre or half stuff had either to be partially or wholly done away with  p  beadle  pointed out during the discussion at the end of his recent history of paper making that certain preservatives used in  for example gelatin sizing were used far less in  he indicated that papermakers could no longer afford the use of gelatin because it cost as much as all the rest of the raw materials in the paper paper had become a commodity primarily composed of fibers from wood sources it was no longer relatively rare or providentially of permanent quality papermakers were expected to supply a printable product with severely limited equipment impure and variable raw materials and very little ability to measure or control such fundamentals for quality production as solution strengths and operating temperatures paper impermanence concerned archivists and librarians as well as cellulose chemists and papermakers during the last quarter of the nineteenth century so many articles were produced expressing such a variety of opinions that just about any retrospective view desired can be thoroughly documented unfortunately suggestions to improve paper permanence were either premature or impractical that is although some paper produced during the last quarter of the nineteenth century was of permanent quality the presentday condition of late nineteenth century books in libraries implies that the bulk of the paper produced was impermanent the twentieth century the report of the committee of the royal society of arts on paper deterioration  summarized requirements for paper permanence in  the expertness of the committee is indicated in the dictionary of national biography  it included richard garnett keeper of printed books at

 the library quarterly however the first patent implying the use of sodium aluminate to reduce acidity was filed by de cew in   it is also pertinent to note that the paper in the university of chicago library copies of these  and  reports is weak and brittle today in  hoffman  used accelerated aging tests to conclude that the ph of a hot water extract of a permanent paper should not be less than  and preferably higher than  he gave ph values for twenty four commercial papers that averaged  and ranged from  to  two years later hoffman and olsen  reviewed the effect of acidity on paper at the request of the chairman of the technical association of the pulp and paper industry committee on fine and special papers they reported that if a ermanent paper is to be manufactured the active acidity of the paper as measured imperically sic must not be greater than that represented by about ph  or   p  the library association  published the report of their special committee on the durability of paper in  this committee was composed of eminent librarians representatives of government bodies manufacturers and professional and trade organizations specifications for two grades of durable paper were recommended  grade  for use where absolute permanence is required and  grade  for use where relative permanence is desired and a commercially competitive price is necessary the recommendation of the committee regarding acidity is inconsistent on one hand they indorse the use of alum rosin size as defined by the society of arts in  on the other hand they specify acidity of paper in grade  the specification is vague for grade  as a reaction to be ph   in situ  p  grant  p  phrased the questions squarely  how should in situ be defined and assuming it can be defined  how can reproducible ph measurements be made pierce and rattee  explained some reasons why ph varies widely within paper the library association itself implied problems with their specification when the durability of paper was announced after the report was passed for press it was found impracticable to have grade  a and b papers manufactured specially to the committee specifications in time for use in the report as intended  p  jarrell hankins and veitch  reported in  that a grade  b paper obtained directly from the papermaker had a hot water extract ph of  see also table  and figs   sample  this article richter compared the permanence of rag and chemical wood pulp papers in  he concluded that hydrolysis can play an important role in the decomposition of paper and listed fiftyeight commercial paper hot water extract ph values  p  these ph values averaged  and ranged from  to  burton  considered twenty eight commercial book papers in  only one of which was considered permanent and wrote a specification for  permanent records  semipermanent records  papers requiring moderate longevity and  papers for temporary use no ph was recommended for temporary use and a minimum hot water extract ph of  was recommended for the more permanent papers rasch shaw and bicking worked with highly purified wood fibers in  and concluded that the stability of

 the library quarterly is much less polluted than oakland california and seattle washington oakland and seattle were classed as unpolluted in  see table  it is concluded therefore that the cold water extraction ph values of the papers which barrow studied would have changed during library storage from their original value in the direction of the original hot water ph extraction values the ph values reported by barrow for the paper in library books from the richmond area suggest that even the weakest papers were in line with the earlier understanding of ph requirements for paper permanence actually the ph values listed in table  indicate that papermakers may have been ahead of their time in that they probably supplied paper with a higher ph value than that which was believed essential for permanence at the time the paper was manufactured it is desirable before continuing this discussion of paper impermanence to digress briefly and  consider an accepted recommendation for the ph of paper and  develop guidelines for the maximum alkalinity at which librarians should deacidify paper church  p  recommended that a permanent paper have a minimum cold water ph of  but set no specification for the hot water extract ph value grant  pp   an early example of recent thinking among paper scientists suggested that a permanent paper should have a minimum hot water extract ph value of  i investigated three book papers that had cold water extract ph values of   and  the hot water extract ph values for these three papers were   and  respectively the permanence of these papers improved dramatically after deacidification when evaluated against the untreated standards by a table  ph specifications for permanent papers compared with ph values reported by barrow averages or recoxendations bmow cold water extracts date   a ten weakest books ten strongest books source minidatie___ source mum ph min av max min av max   committee of society of arts           hoffman            library association           hoffman and olsen    burton   rasch shaw and bicking   scribner dictionary of american biography    jarrell hankins and veitch          grant   library association grade lb paper   jarrell hankins and veitch   casey          sourcechurch  pp

paper impermanence ph and storage conditions  tion was unlikely this comparison suggests that permanence predictions based upon accelerated aging tests can be in error if the prediction does not allow for the effect of storage conditions in other words the generalization  p  that three days of aging at g c   f is equivalent to about twenty five years of normal storage may be misleading for some kinds of paper andor potential book life in libraries the effect of storage in libraries at lower temperatures in other countries has been considered by hudson  and venter  hudson in his  review of the manufacture and testing of durable book papers stated though the authors do not draw this conclusion it is easy now to see why the pressure for this kind of research comes from libraries in the warmer parts of the united states they have already found there that many books fall to pieces after about fifty years in great britain where temperatures are about  c  f lower one would expect similar books to last   years and as the making of books from paper other than rag is only just about a century old the main problem may not have hit british libaries yet that it will do so is reasonably certain and the publication of this book from the virginia state library is timely  p  hudson and edwards  indirectly evaluated the benefits of prolonged cold storage their investigation compared the physical and chemical properties of a copy of a  reprint of poe tales of mystery and imagination everyman library edition which was left in antarctica from january  until november  with copies purchased secondhand in glasgow and manchester their data on ph and folding endurance are given in table  certain differences between the copies such as the above endurance values are statistically significant the point is whether these differences have application to library storage practices it is estimated that the book found in antarctica in  spent one year in great britain two years with scott party and after it was discovered six years in the united states andor great britain before it was compared with the two secondhand copies there are many storage unknowns for example how the book traveled through the tropics nevertheless let us consider that the book had eight years of normal storage and forty seven years of cold storage there is no way to be sure but the original mit folding endurance value table  effect of cold storage on a copy of poe tajes of mystery and imagination variables antarctic glasgow manchester fiber furnish percentage chemical wood pulp     esparto     surface contact ph     folding endurance mit   kg tension md page edge     md page center     cd page edge     cd page center     sourcehudson and edwards  p

paper impermanence ph and storage conditions  when stored at  c  f the problem was to predict the half life value of this paper at lower temperatures the method was to substitute appropriate values into and solve the logarithmic form of the arrhenius equation k ea t t k l   r tt the meanings of the symbols are defined in the following sample calculation where the half life value at  c  f is computed loglokkl is the logarithm base  of the ratio of the rates of reaction k at  c and ki at  c e is the energy of activation which has been experimentally estimated by browning and wink  as  calories per mole r is the gas constant at  calories per  c per mole t is the higher temperature in degrees kelvin or  k    and t is the lower temperature or  k substituting these values into the arrhenius equation we find logk     logk      the antilog of  is  and the half life at  c is  times the halflife at  c that is  years alternatively the calculation indicates that the half life at  c is  per cent  x  of its value at  c this procedure was used to compute the predictions of paper half life tabulated in table  the half life estimates given in table  are based upon experimental evidence where the same moisture content was maintained at the temperatures of accelerated aging as at  c and  per cent relative humidity browning and wink ii discuss the assumptions underlying the predictions of table  the probable accuracy of the predictions increases with increasing temperature because we approach the temperature of the experiment the predictions at temperatures below freezing are low because the acceleration in reaction rate caused by water would be table  effect of storage temperature on paper impermanence average storage average storag tempexratur temperatur paper diff hali lifz dciff from in years  from x f   c in  f in c                                                                                     one folding endurance half life is defined as one year at  c  f for purposes of estimating half life at lower temperatures reduced the data of table  indicate that much of the potential permanence of books is sacrificed when bookstacks are maintained at temperatures in excess of the minimum requirements for staff and patron comfort the predictions of paper permanence in table  depend upon the energy of activation ea and temperatures of reaction ti and t the predictions are supported by data from barrow  as well as from gray  for example
