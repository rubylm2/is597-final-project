 helkenberg et al this paper was produced as a collaborative project by a progressive librarianship class at an ala accredited masters of library and information science mlis program located in canada recent research in lis has identified a need for issues of social justice to be discussed more prominently in lis education from a uniquely student perspective the authors suggest how mlis programs can incorporate social justice as a key component in lis education specifically they encourage pedagogy that supports critical thinking on issues of social justice and provides scaffolding for progressive change for the common good within a library context this includes where social justice should appear in the lis curriculum who should teach about social justice what topics are currently of relevance and suggestions on key strategies for progressive change that can be taught in lis education keywords progressive librarianship social justice in lis education this paper was produced as a collaborative project by a p rogressive librarianship class at an ala accredited masters of library and information science mlis program located in canada we are a group of predominantly white university educated women who are passionate about social justice issues and have a strong interest in m aking progressive change we assume as kevin rioux  p  has written that all human beings have an inherent worth and deserve information services that help address their information needs we also recognize that principles of social justice are embedded within librarianship through our core principles of democracy intellectual freedom e quity social responsibility and a commitment to positive change for the c ommon good american library association  however outside of student led social justice initiatives such as our institutions chapters of librarians without borders and the progressive librarians guild the majority of our class perceived that social justice issues were only moderately discussed across the mlis curriculum this is consistent with a growing trend in library and information science lis scholarship that has identified a need for more prominent discussions of social justice issues within lis education in order to prepare future librarians for their intellectual and practical roles see eg mathuews  pyati  rioux roberts  noble  from a uniquely student perspective our goal for this paper is to suggest how mlis programs can incorporate social justice as a key component in lis education specifically we encourage pedagogy that supports critical thinking on issues of social justice and provides scaffolding for progressive change for the common good within a library context our collaborative project to gather the thoughts of the class as a whole our views on social justice in lis education were collected by answering survey questions based on the major sections outlined in this paper the survey responses were then analyzed for common or unique themes summarized in each section of
education for the common good  the paper and discussed in context with relevant research or theory as a paper produced for a class this project includes the instructor who is both a phd student and adjunct faculty in the lis program her role consisted of creating the concept for the paper as an in class assignment writing survey questions in consultation with the class to organize the classs collective thoughts writing supplementary content and acting as the primary editor alongside student authors social justice in lis programs how should social justice be included in the mlis curriculum currently issues of social justice seem to be covered sporadically across required courses addressed in electives such as information equity or focused on directly in one off courses such as the one in which we were enrolled we strongly feel that social justice should be required content in all mlis programs as only a small self selected part of the student population receives this education when it is primarily offered as an elective we suggest that social justice content may be included in two ways  be explicitly addressed across all required mlis courses or  b ecome a separate required course instead of an elective option in both cases we believe the most important consideration is who would be teaching this content if social justice content is incorporated as a component in all of the required courses it may not be addressed in appropriate depth or breadth to provide a meaningful learning experience instructors would have to approach the content of each required course carefully with social justice issues in mind to avoid treating social justice content as an add on to the course this can be problematic as lis is typically a very i nterdisciplinary field and not all faculty have the same theoretical background practical experience or personal experience that makes them attuned to a wide variety of social issues furthermore as noble austin s weeney mckeever and sullivan  remark faculty who do research on social issues in lis are often underrepresented and undervalued within library schools due to this there is the potential risk of fragmented inconsistent coverage due to these possible limitations this issue becomes even more pronounced when considering social justice as a separate required course to overcome this issue in both scenarios we suggest that for social justice topics the primary instructor take the role of guide and facilitator providing learning opportunities but also sharing teaching responsibilities with other faculty members or experts these faculty members or experts can be  other lis faculty or phd students who conduct research relating to social justice or have strong records of activism  faculty from departments on campus with long standing histories of social critique eg women and gender studies social work and indigenous studies who are familiar with bodies of literature such as critical feminist queer and race theory
 helkenberg et al  practicing lis professionals who may speak to current best practices in community organizing systemic advocacy policy change and services benefiting marginalized peoples or  members of organizations supporting human rights social justice or equity which often partner with libraries such as amnesty international social justice topics the following list of topics suggests social justice issues that we feel are important to include within the lis curriculum from a myriad of topics these six were the most frequently identified by our class across the written surveys as being especially relevant in our current historical moment  diversitymulticulturalism  whiteness in lis  indigenization and decolonization  the digital divide  privilegethe ivory tower and  gender inequalityfeminism other topics include in descending order environmentalism and sustainability accessibility mental health privacy and surveillance the commodification of information homelessness colonialism immigration needs censorship and biases child rights indigenous youth needs and safe spaces this list reflects the need for more focus on cultural hegemonies existing both within greater society and within our profession in particular how lis is dominated by white workers and eurocentric perspectives schlesselman tarango  why are these topics so important to future lis professionals having an in depth understanding of cultural hegemonies directly supports the self reflexive practices that are critical to fostering the genuine empathy and compassion required to work meaningfully with marginalized groups such as immigrants children and teens and those of low socioeconomic status and to promote change within the lis field itself key strategies for creating progressive change for the common good together we have also identified the best ways in which librarians can contribute to progressive change for the common good in their communities and provide suggestions as to how to support these skills within the curriculum  librarians must know their community and understand the needs of their community this includes knowing where to find community demographics understanding them and being able to manipulate the data mathuews  in addition librarians must know how to conduct primary research such as running focus groups conducting surveys and interviewing community members
education for the common good   librarians must advocate for inclusive and accessible services and collections accessibility must be understood broadly which includes low income families immigrants and the homeless services and collections must be representative of community needs they must also understand and promote multiculturalism and diversity in addition to embracing non eurocentric perspectives  librarians must know how to inform the community about social justice issues whether this relates to the librarian as an agent of change or as an educator for the purpose of change the librarian must be an advocate for change within the community this includes supporting colleagues education and knowing how to implement or provide training sessions toolkits and take away resources so that the library and community can begin to resolve the discussed issues curriculum recommendations  lis programs must retain strong foundations in theory and policy to start introducing basic theories of justice provides a foundation for understanding issues of social justice according to the united nations department of economic and social affairs  p  social justice may be broadly understood as the fair and compassionate distribution of the fruits of economic growth but justice itself is defined differently depending on the theoretical approach for instance utilitarians see justice as part of morality meaning they often advocate for social welfare because everyones well being is of moral interest gray  whereas libertarians seek to maximize political freedom and autonomy emphasizing freedom of choice voluntary association and individual judgment institute for humane studies  readings should also be steeped in theories that address social justice issues such as critical theory feminist theory critical race theory and marxist theory lis students should have a close familiarity with major publications that apply these theories such as critical theory of library and i nformation science leckie given  buschman  and the work of lis scholars such as emily knox safiya umoja noble david hudson john budd and paulette rothbauer just to name a few in addition to scholarly literature as ajit pyati  asserts a familiarity with and a critical understanding of policy especially relating to important political and social issues should also receive emphasis  practical non theoretical learning and experiences must also be provided including the following  guest lecturers from library practitioners and experts providing real world experiences  activities and assignments that promote student driven critical thinking on issues important to library work and
 helkenberg et al  assignments that facilitate connections with libraries and community organizations that focus on human rights poverty violence mental health addictions and sustainability in addition to encouraging the application of skills and knowledge learned within the broader lis program  finally in canada especially we collectively felt a strong need to diversify and indigenize the curriculum this can be done by engaging with diverse perspectives authors faculty members guest speakers and more specifically the tenets of the truth and reconciliation report as supported by the canadian federation of library associations truth and reconciliation committee recommendations overall we see a need for a strong presentation of praxis that highlights progressive librarianship that addresses social justice issues if future librarians are to embrace the political components of their practice theory and practice must meet within student learning before students enter the workforce or they will founder when in a position to make change conclusion the lis classroom is where the values of lis that are associated with social responsibility are introduced to future librarians and by extension where the ability to create positive change begins we would like to end this paper by emphasizing the need for solidarity and support for librarians who take up social justice issues in their scholarship and community action as sarah roberts and sofia noble  remind us neoliberalist ideology places social causes as the responsibility of the individual it is important that lis professionals are able to be critical of practices within our own institutions and others without fear of consequence support of one another is essential in creating a work environment that is conducive to social justice through collaboration and encouragement seemingly insurmountable problems become more digestible very often small changes can create positive repercussions wherever possible future lis professionals should be provided a safe space to practice active listening embrace opportunities that challenge their biases and have conversations that might make them uncomfortable as fundamentally progressive social institutions committed to social responsibility libraries have a duty to participate in rectifying the many social justice issues that persist both internally and externally to the field with informed support fostered by lis programs that address how social justice intersects with lis practice emerging lis professionals will be better able to provide services to their communities especially when it requires brave radical acts the authors of this article were members of the progressive library politics course taught at western university in fall  this includes their instructor davin h elkenberg who is also a phd candidate in lis at western university many of the students involved in this project are now recent graduates of the mlis program and are working in public and special libraries or hold positions as analysts archivists and researchers
