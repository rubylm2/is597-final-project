the library quarterly volume xxiii april  number  tite role of the information library in the united states international informatfon program henry james jr resident eisenhower created a nine member board on january   to study the various propaganda operations of the united states government as the first step in assuring a unified aid dynamic effort in this field  essential to the security of the united states and of the other peoples in the community of free nations two months before on november   the new york times had summarized in a front page story the results of a survey of american information activities abroad reports submitted by twenty four foreign correspondents covering forty four nations were critical of most media including the voice of america but hardly an ill word was uttered about any of the united states information service libraries libraries where lectures and discussions are held as well as books made available were said to be growing in popularity everywhere this important if belated attention being given to the united states international information program brings into public view the heretofore comparatively neglected overseas library many questions could and perhaps will be raised concerning the operation and the effectiveness of these libraries this paper intends merely to sketch the background of the information program to glance at the origins and present day activities of the libraries and to explore various concepts of their proper function as media of international communication with the hope of providing a better understanding of the nature of the information library itself development of the overseas information program the information library has always been an integral part of the state department information and educational exchange uste program under a general reorganization effected in january  the tnternational information administration iia was set up as a semiautonomous agency within the department of state to administer the world wide operations of five communications media radio operated by international broadcasting service ibs more popularly known as the voice of america press and publications under international press service ips films under international motion picture service ims exchange of persons under international educational exchange service ies and the libraries under the international information center 
 the library quarterly service ics a condensed account of the part that the united states government has played in international communications is therefore essential to understand the framework in which the overseas library operates a fuller history of the program up to  will be found in charles thomson overseas information service of the united states government the first organized efforts of the federal government in international communication began when president wilson created the committee on public informaticon by executive order dated april   george creel an advertising executive was appointed civilian chairman with the secretaries of state war and navy as the other members the creel committee which has been called america first propaganda ministry was charged with encouraging and consolidating public opinion in behalf of the war effort by keeping the wilson program before the people and making it seem like sompthing worth dying for george creel first job was to win the battle for the inner lines but mobilization of public opinion in this country was but part of the great undertaking when george creel said he was engaged upon a fight for the mind of mankind he was not merely boasting the committee on public information extended its work of education its propaganda for the wilsonian world program straight around the globe it is interesting to note that probably the very first american libraries ever established abroad were those initiated by robert murray in seven cities in mexico these american reading rooms with approved literature newspapers and periodicals always available presented classes in english french bookkeeping and shorthand and were so popular that murray gave up this particular phase of the work with the greatest reluctance when the general demobilization order for his office was received toward the end of january  in the period of isolationist sentiment between world wars popular revulsion against propaganda was strongest and the very thought of uncle sam going in for international press agentry was alien to the american notion of freedom of expression accordingly the federal government withdrew from any active participation in the furious exchange of information and propaganda that continued to grow throughout the world even when the barrage of propaganda from the axis powers and soviet russia assaulted america in rising crescendo in the late  the united states insisted on keeping all channels of communication open the only interference came on the part of congress which in  and  passed legislation requiring that foreign propagandists and their agents in the united states disclose the names of their employers and the nature of their operations the sole exception to this hands off policy on the part of the executive branch was the creation in may  of the interdepartmental committee for scientific and cultural co operation scc and of a division of cultural cooperation in the department of state the purpose of these agencies was to promote good neighborliness in the western hemisphere in large part by means of cultural exchange following united states involvement in world war ii president roosevelt in june  consolidated several agencies disseminating domestic information into the office of  james r mock and cedric larson words that won the war the story of the committee on public information   princeton princeton university press  p  charles thomson overseas information service of the united states government washington brookings institution  pp

 the library quarterly economic co operation administration the marshall plan against the whole truman doctrine of containment and especially against the imperialist warmongers in the united states the oii and particularly the international broadcasting division voice of america gradually sharpened its output to more propagandistic purposefulness soviet charges of racial persecution and terror in the united states became difficult to answer abroad if a full and fair picture of the negro problem in the south were to be projected just as it is many issues such as freedom of speech and the capitalist system were found to be completely misunderstood in certain areas overseas they needed not so much suppression as detailed background explanation and when this was not possible it was found better to omit mention of them in short an adjustment to foreign misconceptions encouraged by communist propagandists took place in the governmental communication process the department of state pointing to this increasingly bitter and vicious element of hate and slander against the american government and people has characterized the purpose of the attacks as the effort to convince millions of persons in europe asia and other parts of the world that the united states is a war mongering power hungry nation determined to dominate other nations this propaganda is designed to poison and to delude the minds of men as a preliminary to their enslavement  the state department booklet goes on to say that this propaganda effort of the soviet union was recognized as a major threat to the foreign policy objectives of the united states to attain those objectives the information program must assist by going on the psychological offensive the effort must be directed toward creating psychological strength and resistance to communism and soviet imperialism in the areas and countries of most critical concern to the foreign policy of the united states in the years immediately following the end of world war i the general output of the united states international information program was well described as the full and fair picture or as a projection of america the aggressive policies of the soviet union have compelled the information program to develop more dynamic content and to increase its level of activity president truman instigated official support of this change in a talk before the american society of newspaper editors on april   he set the goal of this campaign of truth in the following words our task is to present the truth to the millions of people who are uninformed or misinformed or unconivinced our task is to reach them in their daily lives as they work and learn we must be alert ingenious and diligent in reaching peoples of other countries whatever their educational and cultural background may be this task is not separate and distinct from other elements of our foreign policy it is a part of all we are doing to build a peaceful world it is as important as armed strength and economic aid the marshall plan military aid point four these and other programs depend for their success on the understanding and support of our own citizens and those of other countries shortly after this speech which was immediately followed by another by secretary of state dean acheson the eighty first congress voted  for the information program to enable it to build new radio transmitting facilities to add personnel to all media divisions  united states department of state the campaign of truth washington government printing office  p  ibid p   new york times april   p 
role of the information library  and to expand the operations for the exchange of persons press and publications information centers binational centers and films this intensification and expansion of the program has naturally had its effect on over all information policy in general it can be described as a move away from the complete and objective exchange of news and cultural achievements as in the prewar agencies of cultural co operation and toward a more propagandistic approach in which soviet accusations and popular misconceptions about the united states abroad were taken into consideration within the program it is thought of as a shift from the full and fair picture of the united states to the campaign of truth but semantically this second phrase is not accurate campaign in the war of ideas it is but if anything there is less of the objective truth than before of course the basic facts disseminated abroad remain true but there is in the new effort more emphasis on selected fact and slanted information in short the communication is more purposive more aimed at affecting controversial attitudes a special assistant to the administrator of the information program has characterized the change as a closer support of specific foreign policy objectives as he expresses it there are four ways to achieve these objectives  by economic assistance or by its reverse action the boycott  by degrees of military aid ranging as far as open warfare as in korea  by diplomacy which is exchange of information between government and government  by propaganda which is communication on a people to people basis thus while propaganda uses all three devices as pegs for its operation its primary purpose is to condition recipients psychologically to accept specific foreign policy aims in a cogent presentation of the post concepts of the nature of the information program block has said this about the relationship between policy and propaganda by its very nature propaganda cannot operate independently of a policy threshold policy is both the gun mount and the missile propaganla the propelling explosive elenment it can prepare the way for substantive national policy can assist in the qualitative formulation and statement of policy to insure an understanding reception can act to ameliorate the intellectual climate in which political policy is enunciated and has to act but in any finlal effectiveness propaganda must have substantial purposes to work on it is meaningless in a policy vacuum in this respect the north atlantic treaty is a branch of national policy the illumination abroad of american character its integrity of purpose and its power to fulfill its obligations are accompanying propaganda objectives ujnited states foreign policy aims to assure the security of american free institutions and liberal tradition to assist in the development and survival of similar forces elsewhere and to promote conditions of international stability freedom and political evolution likely to contribute to that stability the technical objectives of the united states foreign information and educational exchange programs complement these aims i see wilson compton an organization for international information department of state bulletin march   p  and howland h sargeant the overt international information and educational exchange programs of the united states department of state bulletin march   pp    for a distinction between propaganda and education transmits non controversial attitudes and propaganda and diplomacy language to conclude agreements see b l smith h d lasswell and r d casey propaganda communication and public opinion princeton princeton university press  pp   see also thomson op cit pp    ralph block propaganda as an instrument of foreign policy department of state bulletin june   p 
 the library quarterly a more specific listing of these policy aims still in broad terms is to be found in a state department booklet on the campaign of truth  to strengthen the unity of those nations devoted to the cause of freedom and to show that their interests and those of the united states coincide  to spread the conviction that the united states is an enlightened strong and determined power deserving the full support of other free nations  to stimulate among free nations the building of unified strength necessary to deter aggression and secure peace  to develop and maintain psychological resistance to soviet tyranny and imperialism in line with this sharpening of objectives and the sizable expansion of facilities an administrative reorganization of the information program was made on january   it has been pointed out that the owi as an independent agency was so far removed from centers of policy formulation in the departments of state army and navy that its operational policy suffered from imperfect co ordination with strategic objectives on the other hand criticism especially by certain members of congress was directed at the office of international information and education exchange oie for being so completely within the state department that a free swinging propagandistic effectiveness was hampered by the fact that it was the right arm of the diplomatic body the recent reorganization represents a compromise move in the direction of autonomy in that it establishes the information program as a separate agency within the state department with its own administrator while still keeping its operation closely linked to departmental policy dr wilson compton a businessman lobbyist for lumber interests and a former president of the state college of washington was named administrator of the international information administration hia heading a unit that is supposed to have acquired a higher status reflecting the increased importance of its work the administrator reports directly to the secretary and undersecretary of state he is no longer responsible to the assistant secretary for public affairs who under the former organization directed both information policy and operations the administrator of the iia gains therefore a consolidation of authority in his own hands which in the past was somewhat divided between the general manager of the program who handled operations the assistant secretary for public affairs operations and policy the regional bureaus and the central administrative offices of the department it is too soon to estimate the effects of this reorganization on the information program but dr compton in his testimony before the subcommittee of the committee on appropriations house of representatives in february  emphasized four factors pertaining to the change  close co ordination of the program with foreign policy objectives  flexibility of operation so that information attention can be shifted quickly to areas that become hot spots  increased reliance upon decisions by field officers respecting the needs of their areas and  constant evaluation of the effectiveness of the information operations stress was also put on frequent consultation with congress and co operation with private enterprise in the united states  united states department of state op cit p   thomson op cit pp       sargeant op cit pp    iid pp   cf department of state press release  january  
role of the information library  in summary then the united states information program under pressure from intensified soviet hostility has outgrown tentative hemispheric efforts at cultural exchange and has become a multimillion dollar world wide enterprise the character of its communication has changed from an emphasis on the full and fair picture of the united states to more selective more purposeful information and news designed to affect the attitudes of a huge and diversified foreign audience the whole program is closely tied to foreign policy objectives and is considered an important weapon in the cold war it remains to be seen how the information library fits into this new emphasis on propagandistic purpose and how this new emphasis has affected the operation of overseas libraries origins and kinds of overseas libraries it would be a challenging task to write the history of the united states overseas libraries the data are scattered in magazines and booklets hidden in books and buried deep in official reports this brief section is not intended even as a substitute for the unwritten saga it will serve merely to characterize three kinds of library installation in terms of their origin binational centers the binational centers or institutes as they are variously called were the first full scale institutions devoted to international educational exchange with which the united states had anything to do the american reading rooms of the creel committee in mexico were small scale and short lived the idea for them originated when a group of united states citizens living in argentina joined with interested nationals in  to found a binational society at buenos aires under the name instituto cultural argentinonorteamericano teachers of american english were requested from the states to conduct english classes the concept spread quickly to other american republics and by  there were seven more centers at havana port au prince sao paulo rio de janeiro santiago lima and caracas all established before the government got under way with its official agencies for cultural co operation in june  the united states recognized the value of these existing establishments for longrange cultural exchange by inaugurating a program of assistance in the form of grants to north american administrative and teaching personnel and by furnishing books and other educational materials today under such names as instituto centro clube academia uniao and associasao there are as of june  thirty of them in twenty latin american republics and four in the near and far east on an average they derive about  per cent of their support from classes and membership dues as well as from local contributions what additional funds are needed come from the department of state and the centers are technically under the jurisdiction of the information center service ics they are nonprofit institutions incorporated under local laws of the countries in which they operate and they have a board of directors made up of resident north americans and nationals of the host country with an executive secretary generally from the united states in charge the staff mostly teachers might consist of two or three north americans to thirty nationals the functions of the centers include english teaching library service some circulated as many as  volumes to members annually assistance in schol

role of the information library  special subject they are based on selections made by the library director who is guided in his choice by requests from his clientele which he usually notes on request slips and sends back to washington en bloc and by suggestions he finds in his selection tools such as the standard catalog for public libraries or reviewing senals the program officers scan both kinds of requests for program and area suitability and in the light of budget allotments before forwarding them on to the selection section in this section and the review and appraisals section the steps involved in the selection process are essentially two finding out what is available by means of the standard indexes and evaluating the available publications availability is determined by the usual library procedure of searching such bibliographic guides as the publishers trade list annual cumulative book index reader guide to periodical literature ayer directory of newspapers and periodicals and the monthly catalogue of us public documents and specialized bibliographies of which r r hawkins scientific medical and technical books published in the united states of america the publication of which received assistance from the department of state is among the most frequently used evaluation is a more intricate process involving the application of selection criteria and the use of reviews in such general and specialized serials as the new york times book review the saturday review technical book review index subscription books bulletin the us quarterly book review and many others because of the time lag between date of publication of the book and appearance of reviews the bibliographic section consults forecasts in the library journal and publishers weekly the bookshop services are considered too commercial and requests galley proofs from the publishers for review purposes however the factor of shipping time makes inevitable an extensive delay from the time the book is discovered to when it reaches library shelves overseas a delay that is one of the most vexing problems for librarians in the field reports dating as far back as  and as recently as october  indicate that the machinery of discovering appraising requesting ordering buying shipping cataloging and shelving has remained complex and slow moving shipping time to india and posts in southeast asia consumes as many as three months and the wheels of selection and procurement at ics washington have been known to move very slowly instances are reported where it has taken up to eight months for washington to fill field orders for books the consultants messrs carpenter crowell and kerr in their  report have indicated that this delay is significant in that most foreigners expect the united states information library to be the first place to get a new american work the librarian takes their request  the vexing question of which requests shal be honored by the beleaguered librarian is discussed in harland a carpenter robert l crowell and chester kerr a report on the use of books in the department of state overseas information program washington government printing office  p  the consultants propose establishing a master check list based on the standard catalog for public libraries as a means of shortening the timeconsuming bibliographic selection process they were evidently not aware of the new annotated card system  section  of the educational exchange manual states the books and pamphlets selected shall be evaluated by the department through the use of standard reviewing and selection aids and through consultation with specialists and other professional authorities

role of the information library  in june  about half the information libraries had american librarians in residence there were five in the benjamin franklin in mexico and four in paris two of the largest installations and the rest were run by a public affairs or cultural officer of usis or by nationals of the  librarian positions which were filled seven incumbents had no library training but had knowledge of the area and its language criticism has been made in the past with regard to inadequate briefing of librarians before they were sent abroad but today all personnel undergo an elaborate training course in washington of seven weeks two weeks at the foreign service institute for orientation in foreign service and iia objectives one week on the five information media two weeks in ics washington to learn how to put into effect by means of library materials the aims of the international information program and one week at the new york service section and the voice of america grantees to the binational centers undergo a longer course of five or six weeks at ics washington and non american librarians overseas are brought to the united states for library training and nation wide tours of library installations altogether it seems fair to say that in the light of the above mentioned handicaps hard working recruits at icswashington and in the field are doing the best with what support congress and american public opinion have given them the role of the library in the international information program the difficulty of defining the role of the information library in the jja program is due first to the substantial variations in the kinds of these installations and their activities and second to the disagreement as to what their proper functions are or should be it will help to review the various types in operation their activities and finally the ways in which these libraries fit into the aims of the present information program the first government sponsored libraries that were established in latin america in  and  originated with the close co operation of the american library association and were run mostly by public librarians they were founded primarily to function as model public libraries abroad and operated on the principles of free access to printed materials for everyone assistance by the staff in using these materials and in answering reference questions extension service to the community and use of discussion lectures films exhibits music and the like to promote the library program the aims of this program were to teach good library service by example and to serve the cause of international understanding and peace by means of cultural exchange it can be said that the biblioteca benjamin franklin in mexico city did and still does represent this kind of an overseas library the outpost libraries of the owi were of a slightly different nature designed to function in the british commonwealth they were largely reference centers specializing in materials about the united states chester s williams who was instrumental in founding them has said that the us information library is first of all a reference collection for the use of press radio and other information specialists in owi offices abroad richard h heindel director of the first of these installations in london expanded the concept to take in service to the information facilities of the area as a op cit p

 the library quarterly veloped as far as possible in the light of the principle of directed effort toward specific targets where quarters are adequate it is suggested that film showings lectures discussion groups concerts etc be held in the information centers and supplemented by exhibits bibliographies or other special services from the centers collections which reinforce the activity and draw to the attention of its spectators the permanent reference materials in allied fields which are available in the information center for the library director all this means that he must be informed on the political and economic aims and operations of his government and must understand the sociopolitical economic conditions within the area of his responsibility his knowledge of these factors is necessary for effective selection of materials and for determining the nature of his service to the community those libraries that have the facilities allow use of their space for film showings by ims exhibits by ips and the playing of special recordings of ibs as regards these activities the administrator of ics has explained that one of the reasons why libraries are considered information centers is that these physical quarters are used for other activities of jja even though they were not usually under the direction of the library or necessarily even related to its functions  emphasis on targets and objectives the introduction in  of the country papers which analyze all internal conditions of a country and the establishment of areas of concern have resulted in defining more precisely the target groups of the information program the significance to the library of thus specifying its clientele affects more than the selection of specific materials for a particular audience it means that the librarian must promote his collection actively disseminating his materials to persons who will do the most good in terms of program objectives bringing ideas to people in competition with other ideas this is going further than the early program objectives of correcting misconceptions about the united states and providing american materials reflecting the good and the not so good in national life this is information with a purpose the chief of jcs has described this newer concept of a center as one which while it should in the tradition of democratic libraries provide free service to all who seek it yet it is essential that in its efforts to seek out potential users it confine itself to those persons or groups of persons who are in a position to make decisions on matters of interest to the united states or who control or have access to or can affect the indigenous sources of opinion molding information in other words where one tiny center serves ten to fifty million persons as in india it can work effectively only by reaching them indirectly through its effect on domestic media or by by passing the general public to work directly with those who make the governing political and economic decisions  better evaluationwhile admitting that the role of evaluation in the information program needs more precise definition and has been the subject of criticism the report says iia evaluation is utilizing american market research techniques in shaping output so that it will be more effective it should be seen as a tool intended  to help key executives make all activities more effective and  as a means of measuring their effectiveness as a guide to how much money and effort should be devoted to them for both purposes the best available techniques are currently being employed and extended by iia the program guidance staff of ics is most particularly concerned with such evaluation reports faulty communications between ics washington and the lacy use of the term nformation centers  op cit p   ibid p

 the library quarterly society where that respect is necessary to inspire cooperation with us in world affairs in such a situation cultural activities are an indispensable tool of propaganda it can readily be seen that this is a concept of cultural exchange far removed from that which inspired the ala libraries ten years ago this report presents a concept of the information center worth quoting in its entirety library information center program the renaming of the division of libraries and institutes as the division of overseas information centers is one surface indication of recasting of the concept of the library as a united states information center the essence of the revised training program for all personnel who will be assigned to these centers overseas is the development of the propaganda sense and approach in lieu of the rather vague stereotype of a cultural affairs program the information center is a propaganda instrument yet there has to be considerable adroitness in making effective propaganda use of it the information center should not become openly the focus of all overt propaganda activities locally because some of these propaganda activities are intended for very different audiences than those which normally use a center the symbolic value of the united states information center has been a subject of frequent favorable comments not in terms of a cultural symbol but a democratic one the democratic atmosphere induced by the fact that it is open to all segments of society and by the equally friendly service to all comers also the centers have been regarded as symbols of democratic strength since both sides of controversial issues are often available on the book shelves showing no fear of truth the fact that only a minority of the books in the center are in the local language is not as important as it seems at first sight mlany persons who do not read english use the centers as sources of information by mail telephone or personal inquiry moreover all books useful to the program that exist in local languages are placed in the collections but it is true that the principal use of the centers is by persons who do use english these are the educated classbut the class includes not only scholars and physicians but political leaders journalists writers broadcasters and other moulders of opinion who influence the thinking and political actions of millions of their fellow countrymen all the above material from this report by hia must be considered in light of the fact that it was intended for congress at a crucial money voting time and in answer to certain pretty severe strictures from the bureau of the budget as a highly placed official in iia has remarked congressmen do not think very highly of the library as a propaganda weapon the administrator of jcs has added a realistic reminder that there is bound to be a gap between policy and practice many librarians in the field have been informed of these concepts only by such imperfect means of communication as directives and correspondence and comparatively few have been recalled for the new indoctrination at washington in an interview the administrator summarized the nature of an ideal overseas library operating in accord with current policy directives above all there is no adulteration in good library service rather we in the home office and the librarian in the field are trying to define more sharply the kind of people we want to reach with the kind of material we consider will best serve our objectives plus when possible reinforcement of reading effects by lectures discussion groups and other programs like those of the anzerika haeuser our target is more sharply defined than that of most american libraries we aim at journalists and opinion leaders rather than housewives our information centers are shifting to an active rather than a passive role in supporting the campaign of truth actually as has been said the us
role of the information library  information libraries vary as do the libraries in small towns in the united states they have grown according to the needs of the community and in some cases according to the plan of the librarian first sent out the biblioteca benjamin franklin in mexico city still remains a modified public library the library in paris is largely a reference operation answering inquiries by mail and telephone with objective data about the united states in the far east many libraries have facilities for a variety of audio visual activities and face to face contact much as does an american community center as has been indicated the amerika haeuser with their large book collections diffuse public activities such as english classes and film showings and their extension services and translations might be considered a prototype but the administrator of ics has emphatically stated that we have not taken or realistically contemplated any steps other than exhortation which would actually materially enlarge the non book activities of the former libraries or remold them more nearly along the lines of the amerika haeuser neither buildings nor staff nor funds for backstopping have ever been provided sought or realistically contemplated that would enable them to carry on non book programs in other than a limited manner accordingly it is obvious that there is wide deviation in character and practice among the information libraries there is even wider divergence outside the program at least as regards the proper function of these government sponsored installations a report on the united states overseas information program dated september   by two members of the bureau of the budget advocates conversion of the whole information program to all out psychological warfare about the libraries they remark as a cultural symbol and as a reference source for physicians scholars and other professional people the library has some value in the propaganda program but its impact is limited the concept of the library should be recast along the lines of the united states information center and this establishment should be the focus of all overt propaganda activities locally with the library serving as only one of the facilities available there in sharp contrast to this are the views of luther h evans who wrote in  my personal knowledge of the impression made by american libraries abroad is by no means confined to those through whose reading rooms and book stacks i have been escorted   hardly a week goes by without several foreign visitors passing through my officemen and women from many parts of the world    all of them have been deeply impressed by the friendly spirit of service and helpfulness they have encountered in their search for truth in these libraries and almost without exception when they discuss the american library in their national capital they tell me it is most effective in making the united states known and appreciated at its true worth people are deeply moved by what they experience and i suspect the actuality of free open handed american libraries overseas means as much to their users as the books they read in them they may have read about freedom of opinion in the united states they actually see evidence of it in an american library that contains books different from or even hostile to the views of the administration in power in the united states the presence of one uncensored book critical of some aspect of american life in the open collections of a usie library can do more than a thousand propaganda tracts to convince the doubting reader of the integrity of american goals and the candor with which amerian shortcomings are admitted  helen e wessels and everywhere a library dc libraries july  p   lacy use of the term nformation centers op cit p   robert n beers and james p tauman report on the united states overseas information program memorandum to g w lawson jr september   p  p cit pp   
 the library quarterly many returnees from the overseas libraries seem inclined to support this concept of the importance of a balanced nonpropagandistic collection in the libraries and would still agree with the statement made by ferdinand kuhn in  the greatest danger facing the united states information service it seems to me is that it may be regarded as a mere instrument of counter propaganda against russian propaganda is it not equally important over the long haul for the facts about the structure of congress or the soil conservation program or our public school system to be made available to those everywhere who want and need to know about them the real way to counteract soviet propaganda overseas is not by crude or blatant counter measures   but by making available steadily a picture of america as it really is it was in view of such a concept of the library overseas that an administrator in fia remarked as a taxpayer i would resent the expenditure of public funds for a long range cultural operation modeled on the american public library we are not exchanging general theories with our enemies but are fighting specific ideas vicious ideas in a war of ideas so we want to use books in an active way to change people ideas or to keep them on our side it seems fair to say that a difference of views exists regarding the proper function of the information library in reality of course these views are not so violently opposed as they seem when put down in black and white most of the libraries overseas have a pretty representative collection of basic books about the united states together with items selected to support general foreign policy objectives and local needs and interests having been trained for the most part in discovering and satisfying community demands the librarian in practice is a propagandist less in terms of what materials he has and selects than in the way he uses these materials nevertheless a difference of opinion does exist in terms of how much emphasis should be put on considering and using the information library as a propaganda weapon in the cold war present indications are that the policy makers in the information program prefer to think of the library as properly functioning closely with the rest of the communications media that is as an instrument for getting across particular ideas to specified target groups what has not always been taken into consideration by both sides is how the role of the information library is best suited to its functions as a library per se conclusion proper functions of the information library one of the suggestions put forward in the recent six month study of the use of books in the overseas information program urged that the state department draw up a clear and simple ill of rights for these libraries which would crystallize the scope and purpose of the book program and define the character of the information library and its collections for all to see the consultants pointed out that there is confusion abroad about whether the centers contain a cross section of american books selected books or even propaganda books this is much easier said than done such a bill of particulars would not only have to convey the complex nature of the information library to a foreign audience it would first have to resolve differences at home as to whether the library is properly a propaganda instrument or  ferdinand kuhn jr letting the whole world know survey graphic december  p   carpenter crowell and kerr op cit pp  
role of the information library  an impartial service center whether the operation should concentrate on immediate impact or long range acculturation whether the library should be stocked with anti communist literature or with full and fair representations of american life and similar issues granted that such definitive pronouncements should be made there is a very real question as to whether at the present time they could be made general statements on policies and practices of ics can be found in the educational exchange manual a revised version of which is being prepared by the program guidance staff of ics washington these policy statements are necessarily general cautiously indefinite and determinedly unaware that a conflict exists between the concept of a propaganda library and a democratic service center in the american tradition they would be virtually meaningless to an overseas audience unacquainted with the historic functions of the free american library the difficulties inherent in drawing up such a clear and simple ill of rights  can be measured against the fact that it is hard enough to put into words the varied aims and rights of libraries in the united states a bill of rights for the information libraries which represent most of the american types plus special adaptations to foreign demands would have to start from this unsure ground and advance to very rocky terrain indeed for it can be said that some of the basic tenets on which the whole international information program is operating are enveloped in some pretty cloudy concepts these are worth identifying for they are at the heart of any answer as to the proper functions of the information library  truthpresident truman set the present objective of the program when he said on april   our task is to present the truth to millions of people who are uninformed or misinformed or unconvinced secretary of state dean acheson soon afterward remarked truth in the world today is a political force nothing makes plainer the power of this force i think than the communist fear of it beyond the fact that the truth is per se an elusive entity the campaign of truth that was hereby launched has in certain regards meant an emphasis on selected facts on propaganda to counter the campaign of antiamerican slander by the communists admittedly news is still the basic weapon of the free world but most of the broadcasts of the voice of america represent a winnowing of the news and editorial opinion in accord with policy guidance teletyped daily from washington also some of the picture pamphlets originating in ips are unattributed covert publications that are in essence products of psychological warfare the information libraries have been incorporated into this campaign without as far as i know having established how much of their materials shall be truthful and how much propaganda  propagandathe administrator of iia has been quoted as saying that the program was not dealing in propaganda but information with a purpose the shade of differentiation here is pretty hard to see and the previously cited report from the congressional record talked frankly in terms of propaganda one of the greatest difficulties in preparing this paper was to find definitions of information propaganda and the like which would correspond to actual operational distinctions within iia i think it fair to say as a government re support for an expanded information and education program department of state bulletin july   p

role of the information library  will inevitably increase the differences between overseas libraries the library director in london will concentrate on dissemination of truthful news and reference information about the united states the librarian in saigon will have to think more in terms of influencing the attitudes of his target group with specially selected materials under such variable conditions library operations have to be co ordinated in washington local interests in tunisia for example might suggest that political and public affairs backing be given in support of nationalist elements any such action however would have to be weighed against impairing relations with france the threat of communist seizure in the face of national weakness and many other mundane problems the relationship then between field and washington responsibility for such decisions is one more imponderable another variable that makes neat definitions almost impossible  evaluationas has been mentioned ita stated in the report published in the congressional record that for evaluation of the effects of the program and the success of its media the best available techniques are currently being employed at the same time iia admitted that these techniques like those employed by the american advertising industry measured reach but not results this means that no effort is made on a large scale to determine how the media are really affecting the attitudes of their audience how many italians have been prevented from joining the communist party because of a book from an information library how many communists in indochina have been drawn to the side of the western democracies by virtue of a discussion group how many listeners behind the iron curtain have been encouraged to hope for eventual liberation or inspired to hamper communist progress these mportant questions cannot be answered for two reasons even the multibillion dollar american advertising industry backed by the latest devices of social science surveys does not possess the techniques for measuring effectiveness except in terms of how many people are being reached what kinds of people these are and with what frequency they are reached second even the gathering of this type of information is enormously complicated overseas where most countries have no facilities for carrying on this type of work evaluation by means of this quantitative measurement can specify how many people came into an information library irn bangkok over a certain interval of time or how many books were circulated in athens which is probably as useful to know as it is in a public library in the united states but this kind of reach measurement which the advertisers also use tells even less about the success of an information program than it does about the success of an advertising campaign for there is a fundamental difference between international communication of ideas and selling soap the number of people reached by an advertisement has been shown to have some bearing on sales because few people feel strongly about one bar of soap as compared with another and therefore need only a nudge to act on the other hand the very words used in international communication are freighted with significance and concern matters of controversy and importance paul f lazarsfeld in a foreword to a  united states congress congressional record april   p   ibid see also edward w barrett stressing information themes to meet changing world conditions department of state bulletin january   p

role of the information library  readers equally unmeasurable are the designations surface media for radio press and films penetration media for books which edward p hamilton made in support of his belief that books although they may reach a smaller audience than radio broadcasts have a more lasting influence lester markel has distinguished between long term instrumentalities which like the library are information agencies to be used for the long term objectives and the shortterm media which under the pressure of time are used as propaganda tools a reliable distinction would be all the more useful nowadays because of the fact that the facilities of the information libraries are being used by the other media is there a legitimate difference between the media which would impair the standing of the library as a reliable source of data about the united states if the library served for the showing of a propaganda film or as the dissemination agency for propagandistic ips pamphlets the three consultants in their  reports have said the department needs to make sure its overseas libraries do not lose their present enviable reputations through overzealous adherence to the new anti communist objectives let these libraries become known as mere propaganda agencies for the dissemination of anti communist literature and their effectiveness will be quickly crippled the american libraries are more highly regarded than their russian counterparts in most countries the department cannot afford to let them engage in the kind of propaganda warfare which would reduce them to the latter level  the nature of the librarymost fundamental in determining the proper function of the information library is an understanding of the nature of the library as a medium of communication as has been repeated here the overseas establishments actually represent several kinds of libraries but assuming that the modified public library is the prevailing type i have seen no studies which take apart the operation to get at the basic function of an information center as did the public library inquiry with regard to that institution in the united states in point of fact that inquiry provides the only basic facts obtained by means of social science methods that are available for trying to understand what by its nature the overseas library is best equipped to do in the light of leigh conclusions that the public library is essentially a service organization providing reliable information mainly in the form of printed materials to a relatively small proportion of the population the following general comments on the nature of the information library seem apt  that the library is not suited to be used as a blunt propaganda instrument the limited nature of its clientele the uncertain effects of reading the character of books as repositories of complex ideas rather than simple propaganda slogans and the reputation of a library as a stronghold of truthful information militate against the success of a propaganda library established by the united states  that on the other hand an overseas library regarded solely as an impartial agency for the promotion of cultural exchange is hard to justify today in view of the intensity of the cold war and the inclination of congress to give little support to a purely cultural operation  that as a library it should deal pri  verseas information services of the united states government pp    outposts of us books department of state record may june  pp    public opinion and foreign policy new york harper  bros  p   carpenter crowell and kerr op cit p 
 the library quarterly marily in printed materials as the chief of ics has expressed it with the resources that are or realistically can be made available for the ics program it is clear that the basic objective of the nformation centers must be to provide information in or from printed materials accordingly the nonbook audiovisual activities of the libraries should be limited to use as supplementary means of conveying information or to attract a particular target group to the library  that it can most usefully confine itself to seeking out and servicing small groups of influential nationals who in most areas are represented by the intellectual elite  that the operation of each library must be carefully planned by the library director in the light of the aims of the international information program and specific area situations but that in carrying out day to day duties he must not openly violate the intrinsic nature of the democratic library this last involves walking the tight rope between conducting an operation that maintains public confidence in its objective truthful nature and one that achieves propagandistic results a related list of equally general suggestions for insuring greatest effectiveness for the overseas library operation would include the following points a better facilities and a larger budget to support the use of them b the most competent personnel that can be recruited from the library profession c sharpening of target objectives together with a constant effort to understand results of the library operation in terms of real effects rather than merely reach d coordination of library activities with those of other media and with other united states government programs such as mutual security aid and technical cooperation e continued decentralization in terms of field responsibility for selection of materials and for particular area activities f speeding up the selection and procurement process while at the same time trying to devise some means of relieving the library director of burdensome processing chores to allow him more time to concentrate on promoting use of his collection and g increased effort on the part of rcs to define more precisely those concepts which are presently so fuzzy that they hamper both full effectiveness of the information program and the library operation within it these are counsels of perfection the need for which almost all those working overseas or in ics washington would readily admit but if it is important for those within the overseas library operation to work toward a deeper clearer understanding of the proper function of the information library so it is equally necessary that the members of congress and the people of the united states become more aware first of the information program as a whole and then of the library role within it  lacy use of the term nformation centers  op cit pp    it is not possible here to acknowledge properly the many kind persons in the information center service in washington and new york who supplied necessary data who consented patiently to long interviews who read my first draft and who contributed essential corrections but government workers are used to anonymity and so will probably be content with a blanket expression of gratitude among others outside ics i must particularly thank helen e wessels wayne m hartwell and robert d leigh the original full length paper is on deposit in the library of the school of library service columbia university new york city
