latino librarians on becoming lis educators an exploratory investigation of the barriers in recruiting latino faculty denice adkins library and information science lis schools have produced a limited number of latino masters in library science mls graduates but they have not attracted them back to pursue doctoral studies and teaching positions using a semi structured interview technique eight expert latino librarians were interviewed for their perspectives on the barriers preventing latino lis professionals from pursuing positions as lis faculty this exploratory investigation identifies four specific barriers which are perceived as contributing to the lack of latino lis faculty isolation from the academy ethnocentrism within lis education financial concerns and personal concerns introduction in the   academic year american library association alaaccredited library degrees were awarded to  hispanic students those  students constituted less than three percent of the total number of students receiving mls degrees american library association statistics from  report that  percent of academic librarians  percent of school librarians and  percent of public librarians were of hispanic origin schools of library and information science have produced a limited number of latino mls graduates in addition they have not attracted those students back to pursue doctoral degrees and teaching positions in the   academic year only one hispanic student received a doctoral degree from an lis school and of the  full time faculty who indicated their ethnicity in the  alise statistical report only   percent were of hispanic origin however the  decennial census counted  million people in the latino or hispanic category  over  percent of the population while the low numbers of latino lis faculty are proportionate to the low numbers of latinos in the profession both figures are dramatically disproportionate to the numbers of latinos in the nation nonetheless latino lis professionals do exist reforma the national association for library and information services to latinos and the spanish speaking had over  members in  the majority of whom  of education for library and information science vol  no spring  issn    association for library and information science education

latino librarians on becoming us educators   that for hispanic students the location of an lis school is the highest ranked reason for choosing a program while the reputation of the faculty is not always an influential factor doctoral students need to develop strong ties with faculty who respect their research interests location may not be the best reason for a potential doctoral student to choose a program lis literature has advocated the presence of faculty of color for fostering an ethnically diverse student population at the masters level the importance of minority faculty members in predominantly white institutions cannot be overemphasized but the lack of faculty diversity is a problem for not just for lis  it is acknowledged as a universitywide problem crossing disciplines in each transition between levels of education  high school to a bachelor program bachelor to master and master to doctoral  students of color are lost in   percent of whites had graduated high school  percent had completed four or more years of college and  percent held advanced degrees only  percent of hispanics had completed high school  percent had graduated from four year colleges and  percent held advanced degrees one researcher found a  percent dropout rate for hispanic students pursuing graduate education a study of lis master students at the university of california los angeles determined that minority students have twice the dropout rate of the total population of students transitional loss produces smaller and smaller pools of candidates from which latino doctoral students can be found those students who do make it to doctoral study are likely to feel uncomfortable about pursuing their studies a study of  black white and hispanic doctoral students found that students of color were more likely than white students to perceive their institutions as racially discriminatory and had significantly lower grade point averages another study reports that minority graduate students experience feelings of isolation and alienation and have trouble building relationships with white faculty no information has been collected about the feelings of minority doctoral students in lis but african american and hispanic master level students have reported some incidents of racial insensitivity the lack of role models for minority students may also play a role in the lowered numbers of minority doctoral students role models who share a student ethnic background may help that student to visualize herself in her chosen profession or provide an example for her to follow a survey of  mexican american and american indian doctoral students found that faculty role models from the same ethnicity and gender as the student were especially significant for doctoral recipients the importance of same sex role models is mirrored in lis literature however with only  lis faculty identifying themselves as hispanic the latino lis student is not very likely to find a role model who shares her ethnic background even after latino doctoral faculty have been recruited and supported through the program they can still be lost in the transition point from receiving their doctorates to taking a position as a member of the teaching
  journal of education for library and information science faculty at a college or university less than half  percent of williamson and fenske survey population expected to join college faculty after graduation reeling found that only  percent of  lis doctoral recipients intended to teach after earning their doctorates university faculty positions have traditionally been filled by white males women faculty are much less satisfied with their positions than their male counterparts    and minority faculty feel isolated and unsupported at work women in particular have responsibilities in the home child care household maintenance and supporting a spouse financially or emotionally  which may detract from their ability to meet the demands of the tenure system a  faculty survey found that female faculty tend to be younger than their male counterparts with less education and less experience they spend more time in teaching and service than male faculty and were less likely to work in research oriented universities females are also more likely to teach in female oriented disciplines  like library science in fact the majority of lis doctoral recipients in the s were female the alise statistical report indicates that lis faculty are almost evenly divided between males and females with the percentage of female faculty gradually increasing over the last ten years in itself this may limit the presence of latino faculty wheeler suggests that white women tend not to be mentors for ethnic lis faculty minority faculty have also found that the academy is not a comfortable place minority faculty feel that their student advising and counseling loads are heavier than those of non minority faculty plus their pay may be lower and they face discrimination black and hispanic faculty tend to earn less than white faculty and are less likely to be tenured beyond the teaching research and service normally expected of faculty members faculty of color also become mentors and supporters of students of color this role while valuable takes time away from research productivity respondents to a survey of deans and directors indicated that several had recently made efforts to advertise for minority applicants while the demand for latino lis doctorate recipients is considerable the supply is not transitional loss rates between levels of education contribute to a low number of latino candidates in lis master programs minority lis students perceptions of discrimination combined with a lack of same ethnicity role models make them less likely to return for doctoral studies those who do return may have seen role models in public or academic library administration but probably not on lis school faculty this diminishes students perceptions of teaching as a viable career path and they may have some justifiable trepidation of the tenure process these factors combine to produce very low numbers of hispanic lis doctoral students   out of  total doctoral students in fall   method this project used an exploratory qualitative methodology in october
latino librarians on becoming us educators    in depth semi structured interviews were conducted with eight latino lis professionals who were active in their fields involved in lis issues able to articulate the concerns of latino librarians generally and capable of illustrating their own cases a survey would have restricted respondents to short answers chosen by the investigator while the interview encourages respondents to use their own words share their experiences and introduce subjects that the investigator may overlook interviews were conducted via telephone tape recorded and transcribed the transcriptions were evaluated for trends and commonalities in order to preserve their anonymity comments are labeled as being provided only by pseudonym respondent a respondent b etc of the eight respondents six  percent were female and two  percent were male this reflected the larger profession gender distribution five were employed as academic librarians one was employed as a public library manager and three had previously been employed as public librarians two were employed in non library fields at the time of the interviews one respondent was a recent mls graduate with extensive experience working with latino communities the rest had over five years of professional experience and six had over  years of experience one respondent had a doctoral degree and one was pursuing a doctoral degree neither of these had decided to pursue an lis doctorate some of the interviewees had made a commitment to lis education through involvement in lis school advisory boards mentoring adjunct teaching and guest lecturing respondent a guest lectured at an lis school respondents c and g served on advisory boards and respondent d was active on the advisory board of an lis education foundation respondent c mentored lis students and new librarians explaining somebody mentored me through all of my programs and i just passing the gift of whatever expertise or help i can share based on my experience respondent b had served as an adjunct teacher in an lis school earlier in her career and indicated that mentors were crucial in her decision to enroll in a doctoral program given the high levels of achievement of all the respondents these results may not be generalizable to every latino lis professional results several themes emerge from discussions with latino lis professionals which explain a lack of formal commitment to lis education themes of isolation from academe ethnocentrism within lis education financial concerns and personal concerns ware evident when discussing lis education and teaching with these respondents isolation from the academy respondents named several individual problems which when taken as a whole speak to a larger one a perceived isolation of the academy which separates lis faculty from lis professionals their universities and their communities respondent a noted a lack of
  journal of education for library and information science interdepartmental relationships between lis programs and chicano studies or bilingual education programs while respondent f noted the lack of relationship between the association for library and information science education alise and the ethnic caucuses of ala i can think of the last time i noticed somebody from a library school a faculty member attend any of our ethnic caucus meetings they have their conference beforehand and then they leave just as wee starting to get there she said referring to the alise conference taking place before the ala midwinter meeting respondent e echoed the common concern that lis faculty are disconnected from libraries especially public library branches in multicultural neighborhoods respondent b said lis schools really need to reach the community get the support of the other latino organizations in local area  i think the community has always been a strong part of who we latinos are when asked if she had seen lis schools involved in community action or outreach respondent b answered with a definite no respondent d had to think for a full minute before coming up with an example of an lis professor active in the community and respondent f said about a particular school the connection to the community wasn there    there a lot going on on campus that impacted minority students and there never was much participation from the lis school all of the action sort of just went right by it several respondents indicated that they would need to have an invitation  an active solicitation  before they would presume to approach an lis school when respondent a was asked how lis schools could get committed latino librarians like herself to teach as adjuncts she responded i think you just have to ask wee not in the education world so that out of our experience    if you can recognize librarians who know the literature and can do this you just have to ask respondent d said if you wanted to get more involvement maybe identify professionals who would contribute to a curriculum or maybe just to a class i guess then you would need to invite them to see if they would be interested in participating when asked how lis schools could encourage more latino professionals into teaching respondent g replied as for adjunct instructors schools have no excuse i don even see them trying  i don seem them going around to people and asking them ould you be an adjunct instructor and as far as getting the doctorate that doesn happen either i don see people trying to get latino librarians to get their doctorates respondent c added i don think many latino librarians know about doing this and if they do i think they probably think their hands are full with professional activities i don think library schools are that proactive in trying to get people with an ethnic background to be part of their educational programs respondent b who was earning her doctorate at the time of the interview mentioned a lack of knowledge about the requirements of doctoral studies we need to do more with working with how to do research  we
latino librarians on becoming lis educators   need to do a lot more in the profession to talk about what are the qualifications for a faculty member how do i prepare myself to become a faculty member    if youe going to have adjunct professors what do you want in an adjunct how do you recruit them    what the process for retention promotion tenure do i need to publish if so how do i increase my writing skills how do i increase my research skills what does it take to become an lis teaching professional respondent d said i don know whether latino librarians think of getting a doctorate as an option unless someone stimulated them into thinking that this is an option i don think i ever gave it much thought    i don know what would encourage people to do that option other than to make it more visible maybe there a conference program that those who have earned a doctorate can do where the option becomes more visible to latino lis professionals ethnocentrism within lis education some participants talked about the lack of ethnic representation in their experiences with lis education while others discussed insensitivity toward students this perception of ethnocentrism becomes a barrier to latinos participation in doctoral education said one respondent our experiences even when we were in library school were so intimidating that we don go back several respondents were disappointed with the low numbers of latino faculty respondent a commented that the number of latino faculty was really really terrible and what really awful is that library schools theye not even fazed by this respondent h indicated that more latino educators and professors with real passion and expertise would draw increased numbers of mls students she suggested offering lecturer instructor and assistant professor status to experienced latino librarians who are willing to teach right now i could name a few that could be teaching from their experience in the field students getting their mls should be recruited to continue on and become professors one of the respondents told of her experience serving on an lis school advisory board i the only voice in the advisory meetings that even brings the need for latino faculty up it really really difficult when youe one voice respondent b agreed that the hiring of faculty diverse faculty is really critical however there was a sense from respondents that lis education would not be a comfortable career alternative respondent g said particularly at the professorship level the library school does not look like a place for us latinos having followed the careers of several multicultural lis faculty respondent f concluded that there are very very few lis faculty who are tenured faculty or seem to be supported by the schools    the schools seem to get away with it she noted a distinct lack of support for multicultural studies in lis education and a move toward a more technology oriented less people oriented profession she said i thought about getting a doctoral degree and every so often still think about it i would be more interested in working in a library school but i just really don see a
  journal of education for library and information science fit what with what going on with library education in the last several years some respondents noted cultural barriers which would prevent students from getting their mls degrees and dissuade them from pursuing further education when describing her experience with a specific school respondent a said youe got to have a really thick skin to be able to put up with the attitudes when i was in library school you so much as try to do cooperative learning and you were called a leech you were chastised for working in groups she also noted that she had spoken to a woman who had been discouraged from studying library use within her own ethnic community respondent e said that he had observed a situation in which a faculty member consistently mispronounced a latino student name things like that although they seem like little things they were enough to drive him away from the lis program    for anyone who done esl teaching it obvious one of the things you can do to make the classroom more welcoming is to be cognizant of not only cultural factors but you know getting someone name right respondent f described a situation in which a latina student was getting lost in the system at a library school the whole thing was just so artificial the school acknowledged without really acknowledging that they had nothing for this woman in their school and that there was no one who could help her respondent b noted that if latino students don get the opportunity for mentoring or a sense that the faculty really understand their cultural differences there a great opportunity for people to drop out several respondents felt that the lack of ethnic diversity in the curriculum dissuades latino students from pursuing doctoral curriculum one thing lis educators can do if they have a goal of recruiting more latinos into the field is including latino studies infusing that into the whole curriculum said respondent g respondent h said courses in collection development book selection outreach services programming especially designed to address the needs of the ethnic minorities would be a start according to respondent a library schools do nothing with bilingual education don even try to understand the issues    the one course that approaches libraries as a whole approaches libraries from a management perspective and not from an outreach perspective why don we have any courses on outreach or programming respondent c said i think that serving multicultural communities understanding different ethnic groups all of that should be integrated or diffused throughout the curriculum respondent e suggested that professors should be willing to devote their time in class to talking about language issues or cultural issues in the delivery of information services if professors were willing to make that part of the meat and potatoes of their course that might just strike a chord with students who are from culturally diverse backgrounds financial concerns respondents were very concerned about the cost of doctoral education financial concerns were mentioned by a majority of in
latino librarians on becoming lis educators   terviewees with a definite indication that increased financial aid was necessary to attract people to doctoral programs respondent g said latino students want to do something meaningful theye not particularly attracted to corporate america but they have financial burdens that need to be addressed said respondent a in order for you to go to graduate school you can just have your tuition paid and not have any kind of income    there not enough financial aid out there and more and more latinos shy away from taking out educational loans respondent b said oftentimes economics plays a significant part students have to go back and work to provide help for the family  so that takes a longer bit of time to graduate    financial aid is critical referring to a latina librarian who was earning her phd respondent f said she unusual in being able to do it it very expensive time is also a critical concern to working professionals respondent d said you know going to school and getting the doctorate is something that will require time    when most people think of the doctoral degree they think of a lot of time and energy respondent b said i working on my doctorate  i went every thursday friday saturday and sunday for eight hours once a month the class was only four days a month but it was intense it enabled me to work full time and still go to school respondents also considered the expense of career advancement that might be jeopardized by spending too much time on doctoral studies latino librarians probably think that the benefit of participating in lis education is more indirect than being on a committee that serving on that committee would help them in their job or at their home library said respondent c respondent d added it could be financial where youe working very hard to get your mls degree and then working for a living you get immersed in a career track where your advancement is based very much on a work experience type of exposure personal and family concerns personal and family concerns were least mentioned and considering the success of this group clearly they have found ways to work around personal and family concerns to further their education however respondent b noted that for first generation college students families are not able to be as supportive as they would like to be she added if youe the first to go to college sometimes your family doesn really understand what involved in addition the time commitment necessary for completing doctoral coursework means that less time is available for personal and family commitments respondent a said people like me who are ready to teach  i would have to go back to school and get a phd at age   it too intimidating starting all over again having to tackle a totally different animal with tenure and all that even younger people are daunted by the idea of the time commitment for doctoral studies respondent g said i recently have really developed an interest in pursuing a doctoral degree i think it would be great to be a library school educator but ie got to tell you i
  journal of education for library and information science already  years old and that can be a barrier the age at which we come to librarianship respondent d said i don know whether many of us even consider the doctorate degree    it the mls that gives you an opportunity to enter the profession i don know whether there much of a focus or outreach for people to think    that there still that doctorate degree there wee all eager to just find some work and begin a career implications for us educators and librarians the literature suggests that transitional loss rates family responsibilities and a lack of role models or mentors are barriers for producing faculty of color the latino lis professionals interviewed here have indicated that other potential barriers include the isolation of faculty from the library community ethnocentric attitudes and a lack of communication with lis faculty the latino lis professionals interviewed herein have suggested that communication is key to helping prospective latino faculty overcome these barriers the first and easiest way to increase the production of latino doctoral students is to work with master students already enrolled in lis programs if faculty do nothing else they can at least learn to pronounce students names correctly and respect their cultural differences educators may wish to redesign some assignments to take advantage of group work and different learning styles when potential candidates for doctoral studies are identified they should be given the opportunity to develop their writing and research skills faculty can provide students with the opportunity to do real research within their communities when students turn in assignments faculty should be willing to provide them with meaningful feedback that will help them develop their skills when students know what goes into a good research paper they are better able to produce good research papers potential candidates should be allowed to think of themselves as researchers who can contribute to the lis knowledge base lis educators also need to interact with lis practitioners to foster connections between the two camps and also to identify candidates for recruitment to doctoral studies who are already practicing professionals alumni recruitment campaigns help to keep the idea of future doctoral study among librarians in keeping with the suggestion of one of the respondents a recruitment campaign should tell prospective doctoral students exactly what is involved in doctoral education from the initial entry exams to the defense the association for library and information science education in pursuing liaisons with other lis organizations should consider partnering with reforma the national association for the promotion of library and information services to latinos and the spanish speaking and other ethnic caucuses of the american library association a partnership between alise and reforma would serve both groups by broadening the perspectives of each
latino librarians on becoming us educators   lis educators should also communicate the excitement and joy to be had in research and teaching many latino lis professionals are already qualified to be adjunct faculty available for teaching classes in basic or specialized subjects and serving as role models to latino students  but they do not wish to put themselves forward without an invitation others want to pursue doctoral degrees but have not been encouraged to do so a word of encouragement from deans of lis programs would suggest to these professionals that they might contribute to lis education but without that word of encouragement latino lis professionals persist in thinking that lis education is not an environment for them flexible class schedules are essential as most latino librarians are unable to quit their jobs and pursue full time doctoral studies while some full time study will likely be necessary to complete a doctoral degree a program can be designed which provides the least amount of inconvenience and hardship to the student a support system for doctoral students of color is necessary and not just to provide financial support writing and research advice teaching experience and social networking should be provided a community service component might be added to connect latino resident students to the type of cultural environments they might have left behind deans and directors indicated that they have advertised for ethnic minority faculty and not found them it is for deans and directors to create those faculty they can work to alleviate the latino doctoral student resource crunch by aggressively pursuing financial aid resources and also by providing a support network of faculty and other students who share the same concerns the dean attitude toward ethnic and linguistic diversity is communicated to the rest of the faculty latino doctoral students should view deans and faculty as approachable rather than formidable a feeling of acceptance within their departments may encourage latino doctoral students to persist in those studies in addition deans of lis programs can insulate students and faculty from ethnocentric attitudes in other parts of the university the responses gathered here suggest that latino lis professionals have a negative perception of lis education before they are able to recruit many latino faculty into doctoral programs lis faculty will have to change those perceptions the current lis faculty need to open the door for latino lis professionals to become involved with professional education and invite them to become the next generation of lis faculty latino librarians need to know that their background and knowledge is respected that they have something to contribute to lis research and that the commitment to having a diverse lis faculty is not just lip service of the struggle to recruit and retain librarians of color kravitz writes if as a profession we want to continue to recruit and retain talented librarians of color then we need to first acknowledge the barriers to advancement and second and most importantly work to eliminate them this is equally true for recruiting and retaining latino lis faculty
