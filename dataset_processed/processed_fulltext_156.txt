the library quar tely volume xiv july  number  special collections of negroana arna bontemps r eferences to special collections of negro lore have been cropping up in library literature for a long time soon or late no doubt it was inevitable that someone should have a look at the whole species the present report is the result of such an inspection obviously all negro collections could not be examined at first hand or studied closely a few outstanding and perhaps representative examples were selected after preliminary inquiry and these minus one described elsewhere are the collections treated herein the schomburg collection of negro literature perhaps the best known certainly the most publicized of the negro collections is located in the one hundred and thirty fifth street branch of the new york public library the division of negro literature history and prints as it was originally designated was established in  a year later it obtained the schomburg collection one of the largest and most important private libraries on the negro with this acquisition containing between five and six thousand books three thousand manuscripts two thousand etchings and several thousand pamphlets the division at once became a center for scholarship dealing with negro life and history actually the collection has a longer history than the date of its founding implies indeed it has three histories the first can be traced in the history of the new york public library itself the second is rooted in the harlem community and the third is a personal story as early as i the bulletin of the new york public library mentioned a list of works relating to the american colonization society later surveys of resources and guides to special collections have noted the slavery collection of the new york public while these items do not relate directly to the division of negro literature history and prints a certain kinship may be detected almost from the beginning of its existence the new york public library appears to have shown some interest in negro materials moreover there was precedent of another sort in the new york system the central library includes other racial divisions which antedate even the slavery collection the jewish the slavonic and the oriental divisions are examples i the james weldon johnson memorial collection of negro arts and letters yale university library gazette xviii    i
i the library quarterly even the notion of putting such material in a neighborhood library was familiar the collection of czechoslovakian literature is located in the webster branch and the russian literature collection formerly located at one hundred and twenty fourth street is now at the hamilton grange branch following the ethnic group as it shifted from one section of the city to another so while the division of negro literature history and prints including the schomburg collection was at the time of its establishment the only division of its kind in any public library it was not without a certain background in new york its roots in the community are perhaps equally significant when the one hundred and thirty fifth street branch was established in i the neighborhood which it expected to serve was a quiet well to do american jewish section by i it had become half negro and the influx was just starting ernestine rose chosen because of her experience in developing library service among racial groups was made librarian for the express purpose of adapting the staff service and book stock of the branch to its altered public by  harlem had become the acknowledged capital of black america its population thanks to the migrations of the preceding decade had reached approximately i  at the same time it had drawn negro talent and leadership from all parts of the united states and from the caribbean young musicians and writers assembled there serious scholars took note of the group and of its relation to the burgeoning community all negro shows became broadway hits the american mercury at the peak of its popularity came out with a series of spectacular articles on uptown doings novels like carl van vechten nigger heaven became best sellers park avenue discovered a fabulous night life centered around the cotton club baron the nest and other spots in harlem the survey graphic published a large special issue devoted to harlem the attention thus drawn to the new nerve center of negro life in america resulted in a book called the new negro in which the same material was greatly expanded these and scores of related developments gave the community a new spurt of growth a fresh surge of race consciousness by the end of t ernestine rose had a serious library problem on her hands books on the negro were in such demand that they could not be kept on the shelves so avidly were they read in fact that their mortality exceeded their birth rate titles which continued in print could not be replaced fast enough with the available funds books hard to obtain were deteriorating without hope of replacement the branch librarian was frankly distressed in her perplexity she called together a group of influential scholars and leaders from the community among them were arthur a schomburg james weldon johnson hubert h harrison and john nail the first result of the consultations which followed was the decision to start a modest collection of rare books relating to the negro books difficult to replace these were to be withdrawn from the circulation department the primary aim being simply to preserve the existing resources in this field this modest gesture provoked an immediate response on the part of the community and of those who had been called in to represent it gifts and loans came to the new collection from the private libraries of people like j e bruce louise latimer hubert h harrison george young dr charles d martin and arthur a schomburg perhaps the idea of building up a col
special collections of negroana i lection that would give the harlem public a sense of background had already occurred to miss rose the new york public library general policy of buying books of special neighborhood interest would suggest this in any case the books withdrawn from circulation and placed in the reference room soon began to supply material to students of negro history and culture both in the neighborhood and elsewhere and on may   the new division of negro literature history and prints was officially opened in outlining the division plans to the press miss rose called attention to the fact that although there were then collections of the same kind in the library of congress in the libraries of such institutions as tuskegee and howard university in certain large city reference libraries and in a few private libraries the collection at the one hundred and thirty fifth street branch promised to become one of the largest and most valuable in the whole country she gave her reasons for this prediction to begin with there is the question of availability works of this nature in private collections and in institutions are not readily accessible to great numbers of students of these problems either white or colored we have here in harlem the greatest negro city in the worldapproximately i colored inhabitants there should be available for these people and for those who have their interests at heart the most interesting and complete collection that can be formed these books will foster the interest of the children and young folk in the history of their own race and inspire them to develop their own talents the collection should be available equally to scholars to the man in the street and to school children of all races she called attention to several unique items in the collection as it existed then none of them impressive by later standards and announced the organization of a group of prominent persons to promote the new department today her statement seems overly optimistic on the basis of the collection in hand and the immediate prospects but it was taken seriously by the times and other new york newspapers and in i the collection received the windfall that justified miss rose optimism and raised the division to its present importance this came with the acquisition of the schomburg private library the third history behind the schomburg collection of negro literature is as has been suggested a personal story arthur alfonso schomburg a puerto rican partly of negro descent was born in i he was educated in puerto rico and later at st thomas college in ii he came to the united states here he was employed for a number of years as a clerk by the banker trust company but the force behind his long and zealous career as a collector of negro lore appears to have been generated by a casual statement by one of his elementary teachers on the island that individual as schomburg later recalled dropped the remark before his pupils that the negro had no history there was no bitterness in the observation as he made it no intended aspersion yet the assertion touched off a fire in schomburg that was still burning brightly at the time of his death on june io i oddly enough this story is essential to an understanding of the collection which the one hundred and thirtyfifth street branch has built around the private library of arthur a schomburg here in fact is its point of unity its principle of selection its area of interest that the story encompasses and reflects a special need of the community can also be assumed the american negro must remake his past in order to make his future schomburg wrote in an essay included in an anthology of american negro literature when we consider
i the library quarterly the facts certain chapters of american history will have to be reopened he then pointed to an exhibit of pamphlets documents prints and engravings from the collection in the new york library and asserted proudly here is the evidence his argument is worth following though it is orthodox to think of america as the one country where it is unnecessary to have a past what is a luxury for the nation as a whole becomes a prime social necessity for the negro for him a group tradition must supply compensation for persecution and pride of race the antidote for prejudice history must restore what slavery took away for it is the social darage of slavery that the present generations must repair and offset so among the rising democratic millions we find the negro thinking more collectively more retrospectively than the rest and apt out of the very pressure of the present to become the most enthusiastic antiquarian of them all this point of view schomburg admitted is not new in io abbe gregoire the genius of french abolitionist sentiment published in paris a book about distinguished negroes two years later the volume was issued in translation in germany and england compendiums of the same sort have followed at intervals ever since many of them schomburg grants have been over corrective ridiculously over laudatory but the purpose has generally been sound today scholarship in this area is better balanced and the need is for a welldocumented history a history that is less a matter of argument and more a matter of record schomburg own research had he felt established at least three conclusions first that the negro has been throughout the centuries of controversy an active collaborator and often a pioneer in the struggle for his own freedom and advancement this is true to a degree which makes it the more surprising that it has not been recognized earlier second that by virtue of their being regarded as something exceptional even by friends and well wishers negroes of attainment and genius have been unfairly disassociated from the group and group credit lost accordingly third that the remote racial origins of the negro far from being what the race and world have been given to understand offer a record of credible group achievement when scientifically viewed and more important still that they are of vital general interest because of their bearing upon the beginnings and early development of culture the international flavor of his collection becomes understandable when these points are held in mind schomburg european quests and his preoccupation with latin american materials begin to make sense the rarities and treasures which he unearthed begin to take their places in a clear cut scheme under these conditions one would scarcely expect to find the collection putting great store by slave documents even folklore could be expected to take second place to records of achievement and evidences of negro progress jupiter hammon an address to the negroes in the state of new york edition of i the work of america first negro poet was obviously in the right mood for schomburg could heartily applaud the poet now famous remark if we should ever get to heaven we shall find nobody to reproach us for being black or for being slaves manuscript poems and early editions of the works of phillis wheatley slave girl immediately became part of the evidence which the collector had dedicated himself to assembling in the same category were the sermons of lemuel haynes the negro who served as pastor of a white church in rutland vermont for thirty years following the revolutionary war and john marrant st john day eulogy to the brothers of african lodge no  delivered at boston in

special collections of negroana the schomburg collection of negro literature has come to the point where it must define the field of its future growth and expansion dr reddick has set these forth in a recent interview the collection will continue to add to its resources all new publications that fit into the categories already established it will consider any title which concerns the negro in the united states within its scope outside the united states it will seek to be exhaustive in the negro in latin america with special reference to the caribbean and in africa in the twentieth century the collection will take a positive interest in race relations at home and abroad obviously schomburg principles are still the basis for the expansion of the collection which he founded dr reddick proposals in no way conflict with schomburg own forward glance the  most fascinating of all of the attempts to open up the closed negro past the latter once said is the important study of african cultural origins and sources the bigotry of civilization  must be corrected at its source fundamentally it has come about from that depreciation of africa which has sprung up from ignorance of her true role and position in human history the recognition which african sculpture for example had received first in france and germany then gradually in the united states seemed to him to be highly significant the treasure of treasures in the schomburg collection is of course the volume of juan latino poems edward laroque tinker columnist for the new york times book review is authority for the statement that this is one of the rarest books in the world in the schomburg collection however the juan latino is both a treasure and a symbol it suggests both the past which the collection has sought to rediscover and the kind of future toward which it strives a library of negro authors the arthur b spingarn collection the arthur b spingarn library is the only collection of its kind which limits itself to negro authorship all the others have focused their interest upon negro life or history as a subject the collection which has evolved from this principle of selection has more in common with the schomburg collection with its accent on achievement than with any of the others examined in connection with this study the result is not surprising arthur schomburg started his collection for the purpose of correcting historical misrepresentations which embarrassed him as a negro arthur b spingarn a white man actively interested in the welfare of negroes started out to assemble a small representative group of books that i could show to doubting friends who questioned the intellectual capacity of the negro he intended to offer these few specimen books to his own acquaintances who asked if the negro has the capabilities you insist he has why hasn he published books to prove it that this plan would gradually extend itself into an endeavor to collect all books written by negroes certainly did not occur to him at that time yet this is its present scope and ambition while the goal has not been achieved it has undoubtedly been approached this means that barring a few score rare items that have eluded the collector all books by authors known to have been negroes have found a place on his shelves mr spingarn admits the obvious possibility that many foreign language books which
i the library quarterly would fall within the area he has selected may have escaped him the extension of his first modest endeavor to its present scope he attributes to a human instinct which he has described as the mania for completeness thus the endeavor to collect something the negro had written became the really large task of acquiring everything the negro had written the method by which he proceeded was not unconventional he began with his own reading and experience the first step was to acquire as large a list of negro names as possible to carry in his memory for reference purposes whenever these basic names were encountered they would be recognized with this equipment he turned to the available check lists to who who to american negro and african college catalogs to histories church records biographies autobiographies proceedings of negro conventions transactions of lodges antislavery literature and negro periodicals abbe grgoire book of negroes of achievement paris io offered a good point of departure the names included in this volume were followed through the catalogs of the great american libraries the british museum and the bibliotheque nationale an anthology called les cenelles published in new orleans in i became even more useful written in french by free men of color les cenelles was the earliest collection of poetry by negro poets in the united states its contributors pursued singly turned out to be surprisingly good material one of them for example was victor sejour spingarn discovery of this author one of the most popular dramatists of his period in france is typical of the general results of his search french encyclopedias like the nouveau larousse illustre and the larousse du xxe siecle generally assume that sejour was a parisian and carelessly state that he was born in the french capital nothing is said of his negro blood for from their point of view as in most countries other than the united states and perhaps great britain this has generally been regarded as an immaterial literary consideration it has meaning for this collection however and spingarn made it his business to establish the point when sejour name was found among the colored poets of new orleans in les cenelles spingarn went to work on his bibliography a diligent quest here and in europe eventually yielded copies of nearly all the dramatist twenty two published plays later investigation by scholars whose attention had been drawn to sejour origin brought out the fact that he had been born in i in the heart of the old french quarter of new orleans his white father a native of saint domingue colonial haiti and his free colored mother were not married at the time but later this omission was corrected sejour baptism was recorded in st louis cathedral the free colored caste numbered nearly twenty thousand in new orleans at the time les cenelles was published many of its members were well to do and a surprising number of them were sent to paris to be educated many like victor sejour remained abroad to escape the restrictions imposed upon their group in new orleans though these were in the main far less severe than elsewhere in the southern states against this background the story of sejour was easily understood moreover it was a clue to other writers from the same background this type of historical and bibliographical detective work was essential to the principle of selection which spingarn
special collections of negroana i had adopted his sources were severely limited check lists on the so called negro problem seldom differentiated white and colored authors being concerned as they were with the negro as a subject not as a point of view or as a voice a few specialized histories were found to have bibliographies appended but most of these were too sketchy to be helpful to a man who had undertaken to collect everything the negro had written even monroe n work extensive bibliography of the negro was so far from complete that spingarn presently found that he had approximately a thousand books and pamphlets not listed in the volume none of this is meant to imply that conventional tools were of no help at all vernon loggins the negro author restricted to american authors writing before i was useful within those limits specialized check lists of poetry were found also catalogs of exhibitions more often however spingarn appears to have relied on his own enterprise he examined all the existing collections he could find public and private he wrote letters to editors and scholars in the united states in africa in the west indies and in central and south america he made contacts with american consuls in a variety of places and he hobnobbed with others who were working the same field exchanging books stories and ideas with these kindred spirits the current output he endeavored to follow through the usual book supplements and trade publications this presented no special problem in the whole world of books however the question who is a negro is not an easy one neither walter f white the fire in the flint flight rope and faggot nor charles w chesnutt the conjure woman the house behind the cedars etc nor jean toomer cane would be considered a negro any place other than in the united states or perhaps great britain yet they live and write as negroes here alexandre dumas father and son and alexander pushkin would be classified as negroes in the united states though they neither lived nor wrote under such a label others like audubon and browning must be put in a doubtful category spingamn broadened the base of his selection to include any author who would be classified as a negro in the united states this it need scarcely be added gave him ample scope it meant for example a wide swath for his blade in brazil cuba and most of latin america and the caribbean area it meant to put it in quite another way the inclusion of more than two thousand authors before i even then the coverage was by no means complete and since that date it has been steadily expanded while foreign publications covered some of the most interesting areas in the field which spingarn had chosen for himself they also offered some of the most annoying problems as has been indicated negro authorship is a concept which lacks meaning in many foreign countries here and there however spingarn managed to stumble upon the kind of help he needed the bibliograffa de autores de la raza de color de cuba by trelles i while neither exhaustive nor completely accurate according to the united states definition of color was nevertheless such a help it listed something over a hundred cuban writers of negro blood similar assistance was found in an exhibit of books at the club atenas in havana where seven hundred works by colored haitians were displayed to these spingarn was able to add a bibliography gleaned from the

 the library quarterly to howard advantage and they have been used energetically by an active and alert director mrs dorothy b porter the result is a well organized reference library strategically located in the nation capital available for serious research and housed in the new rioooo founder library at howard the distinguishing feature of this collection as compared to the others described herein is its relation to the curriculum of the university built originally around the two private collections mentioned above the moorland foundation nevertheless reflects even more strongly another influence its growth and expansion have been in the opinion of its director basically conditioned by howard courses in the various aspects of negro life literature and history the largest of the negro institutions of higher learning howard has had many such courses and not a few others in which the negro background of its students has tended to slant the teaching inevitably the library was affected the results of such a principle of selection are perhaps no more unusual than the principle itself the moorland foundation like the collections at fisk atlanta and other colored schools includes everything about the negro which promises to fit into the educational program of the institution these materials viewed as a spectrum might show rarities like hiob ludolf a new history of ethiopia london i and the pamphlet an african anti slavery views  at one end and at the other the titles of howardiana including the writings of howard faculty members material about the university and the university own publications in between there would be a number of distinct shades but where one ended and the other began would be hard to determine perhaps this tendency toward fusion explains the arrangement of a catalogue of books in the moorland foundation this mimeographed publication also a product of the work projects administration is broken down not by subject but by the publication dates of the titles listed an odd side view results it is discovered for example that of the five hundred pages of annotated items ninety four are devoted to titles printed between i and i the period between i and i is represented by listings which fill twenty three pages nineteen pages are devoted to unpublished howard university master theses some uncataloged pamphlets were also selected for inclusion by the spring of  mrs porter estimated that the catalog listings represented less than one third of the collection current holdings new gifts plus purchases in excess of ioooo worth of books in the four year interval had brought their number of cataloged items to about i the influence of the moorland room has been considerable its director has written frequently about the collection and the special problems of librarianship which have grown out of it her master thesis columbia i was on afro american writing before i since that time mrs porter has contributed to the american scholar and frequently to the journal of negro education a credit too goes to the moorland room for naomi j rushing cataloging and care of negro collections another columbia master thesis miss rushing is still on the staff of the howard library oberlin s antislavery propaganda the antislavery materials in the library of oberlin college are a part of the
special collections of negroana i history of the school oberlin it should be remembered is the school for which john brown once solicited funds its campus was at one time the scene of a heated argument between stephen foster the song writer and those who favored compromise and gradualism in the solution of the slavery problem founded in i by john j shipherd an avowed abolitionist and philo p stewart it touched the controversial issue lightly at first but two years later oberlin president and founder made history by persuading the trustees to permit negroes to enter the school the same year the oberlin antislavery society was founded the views expressed at this time were moderate but a few months later a group of firebrands invaded the college they were led by theodore d weld and all were former students of lane seminary in cincinnati seceding from the latter institution because of their unbending stand on the slavery issue weld and his colleagues thoroughly converted oberlin college and community to the abolitionist doctrine thereafter the place continued to be the center of underground railroad and antislavery activity with this background the library inevitably came into possession of a firstrate stock of the literature of protest issued by the advocates of emancipation during the years of their campaign in  geraldine hopkins hubbard preparing a master of arts thesis at oberlin college counted some seventeen hundred separate items dealing with slavery this collection she discovered could be traced to the original oberlin collegiate institute library the institution passed through a severe financial crisis in i  hoping to collect enough money to save the situation william dawes and rev john keep agents of the college went to england and made an appeal on the basis of the school affiliation with the antislavery movement the british responded and the representatives of oberlin acquired in addition to the needed finances about six thousand volumes for their library among these were many antislavery pamphlets and books mostly from the british point of view an indication of their success is the fact that the two year period of i  is now represented in the collection by no less than twenty eight british titles these include a first edition of elizabeth heyrick immediate not gradual abolition and items by thomas cooper james cropper william wilberforge and many others the copy of buxton the african slave trade which the school agents brought back is inscribed to the deputation from the oberlin institution from their and its friend and servant george thompson london may i i in a copy of j j gurney a winter in the west indies they brought home this inscription to john keep from his friend geo sturge in pleasing remembrance of his visit to england i  not less valuable though lacking an inscription was the copy of granville sharp a tract on the law of nature and principles of action in man i a number of years later in connection with the opening of the spear library building in i a campaign to enlarge the historical collection on slavery was undertaken by a faculty committee composed of the reverend henry matson the librarian professor james monroe and professor william goodell frost three times this committee issued the following appeal we have a very valuable collection and desire to make it complete we desire to secure a copy of every book pamphlet report speech
 the library quarterly tract newspaper or private letter bearing upon the subject among those who responded with contributions from their private libraries were professor john morgan theodore j keep mrs sarah l dickinson reverend george clark and reverend william w patton also acquired through the same appeal was the more important gift through heirs of the collection of william goodell as a front line abolitionist active in both the liberty party and the liberty leaguers goodell had assembled materials representing every phase of the movement from the time of its beginning in the united states his gift moreover included his own antislavery works among them the rare files of the newspapers he edited then there were autographed presentation copies which goodell had received from his colleagues in the movement albert barnes an inquiry into the scriptural views of slavery was such a volume as were also la roy sunderland the testimony of god against slavery lucius c matlack the history of the american sla very and methodism foss and mathews facts for the baptist church and a first edition of the unconstitutionaiity of slavery by lysander spooner and with the goodell collection came a variety of manuscripts relating to the same subject most important of these is the declaration of sentiments of the american anti slavery society in the handwriting of william lloyd garrison in the years that have followed the collection at oberlin has acquired by one means or another an interesting assortment of rarities typical of these perhaps are the following i several volumes of the liberty bell two of which are autographed by maria weston chapman and another to s margaret fuller with the regards of oliver johnson  a copy of w w brown clotel autographed by the author  the history of the rise progress and accomplishment of the abolition of the african slave trade by the british parliament by thomas clarkson inscribed to wm w patton from joseph sturge per lewis tappan  files of the anti slavery examiner antislavery tracts the liberty bell and liberty minstrel not all complete oberlin has also a good collection of the children literature of the antislavery movement a most interesting phase of the campaign other collections there are several other important collections of negroana in the united states lacking any easy or convenient method of locating these or of evaluating them from a distance this reporter employed a device which may not be without a certain quaintness knowing that the charles e tuttle company of rutland vermont had long made a specialty of the material in which these collections were interested and having seen the undated tuttle catalogue no i i books by and about the negro and slavery he struck upon the idea of tracing collections of negro lore through the sales records of this company the plan may be said to have worked for it had the interest and co operation of mr charles e tuttle himself and he had kept detailed notes of his company transactions from his cards it was not only possible to determine who was buying in the field and how much but also who had what among the rarer items inferences could also be drawn with respect to which collections were static and which growing while the more detailed descriptions in the foregoing sections are based in considerable part on personal observa
special collections of negroana  tions and interviews with their directors the following are mainly drawn from evidence and clues provided by the tuttle files duke north carolinathe combined negro collections of these two university libraries may be larger than any single collection described in the foregoing pages certainly the tuttle company sales to duke for its flowers collection of books about the south would indicate this something of the nature and scope of the collections may be surmised from a few available facts it is known for example that the division of the field has given folklore sociology and literature as these pertain to the negro to north carolina and assigned history the negro in the caribbean etc to duke even this division of area seems explainable guy b johnson a member of the north carolina faculty has for years been a leading authority on the negro with a great knowledge of folklore and genuine enthusiasm for the material his volume of john henry songs is one bit of evidence howard w odum sociologist in the same institution made his reputation with books like rainbow round my shoulder and wings on my feet imaginative treatments of negro materials and his sociological studies have never been far removed from the mores of those early books then there is paul green the dramatist who despite commercial success on broadway has maintained his connection with the university at chapel hill paul green plays are predominantly negro plays from the no ount boy to his pulitzer prize winning in abraham bosom and his dramatization of richard wright native son the university community which includes all three of these unusual southern scholars surprises no one by owning what they have reason to feel is a right smart collection of library materials dealing with the ways of black folks cornell and otherslike oberlin cornell owns a large body of underground railroad lore and antislavery propaganda indeed its collection is even better known in library circles and is said to be larger than the one at oberlin the history behind these resources is perhaps not entirely unlike the background of the oberlin materials it is known for example that the gerrit smith papers and effects went to cornell and that the community around utica was as strategically located for underground railroad passengers as was central ohio furthermore the abolitionist sentiment was just as strong in upper new york state in fact it would not be too great a mistake to say that for a number of years while frederick douglass was editing his paper in rochester the center of gravity of the antislavery campaign shifted to that part of the united states however that may be cornell with its samuel joseph may collection is admittedly strong in slavery and antislavery materials indications are that the collection is static however the tuttle company showed no sales to them and had no records reading cornell wants  as was the case with most of the others wisconsin johns hopkins and pennsylvania all reputed to have extensive slavery and antislavery collections were likewise relatively unrepresented on sales or want cards michigan on the other hand with no reputation for unusual holdings in this field was buying antislavery items actively and increasingly within a limited area harvardthe interesting thing about harvard was that while it probably had as much negro material as any library
 the library quarterly in the country and while it was adding to its stock as actively as any it had not thrown these materials together to form any sort of special collection in its case lacking any special motivationthis seemed a sensible way of handling the subject there was both rhyme and reason behind collections like the schomburg in new york the james weldon johnson at yale indeed behind all of those visited but wanting these purposes it would be idle to invent them two aspects of harvard holdings in this field apart from its obviouis volume seem worth pointing out first is the tendency to include slavery in the library of the school of business if this implies i not sure it does that harvard regards the moral and sentimental and propaganda angles of the slavery controversy as of less importance than the business considerations then librarianship at harvard has taken a positive step which is interesting in its connotations a second point concerning harvard negro materials was also derived from the tuttle company records t franklin currier appeared to be the individual who represented the library in this field and t franklin currier is the scholar responsible for the definitive whittier bibliography whittier being the poet of the antislavery movement would seem then to be the point of contact between the present library staff at harvard and these negro materials brownthe files of the tuttle company showed brown university library to be in the market for all negro music and poetry this special acquisitiveness could in turn be traced to s foster damon the individual in charge of brown harris collection of american poetry mr damon had not only let it be understood that he was to have a chance at all materials in this field but had frequently been a visitor at the tuttle establishment and had inspected the cards in the negro cases further research revealed s foster damon as the author of a monograph entitled the negro in early american songsters first read before the american library association and including a mention of backside albany ii one of the first of the genre this paper seemed to throw a certain light on one aspect of his zeal as a curator swarthmorethrough the efforts of henry j cadbury whose specialty is the society of friends and books and collections which concern quakers swarthmore college appears to have acquired a good stock of material from the tuttle negro list the connection is accidental but obvious most historical works relating to the friends are likely to be concerned with the negro and slavery in some measure emorythe testimony of william c haygood a former member of the emory library staff had led me to expect references to their negro collection in the tuttle cards none was discovered the inference to be drawn is that the books with which they have surrounded the literary effects of joel chandler harris author of the uncle remus stories are mainly in print items it may be further inferred that the emory university library has been more concerned with providing a background for their treasure than with reflecting the negro scene in a broad context fiskone of the foremost negro collections is located at fisk university fisk founded in i became a leading negro institution of learning as a result of the triumphal world tour of its original jubilee singers in ii when tuskegee institute was established based on
special collections of negroana  the vocational idea of booker t washington fisk accepted responsibility for leadership in liberal education for negroes the fisk negro collection is therefore a long established one indeed the moment of its creation cannot be fixed though a certain genesis can be discovered determined efforts to build an important collection in this field began in the late i it was considered in the plans for the new library building which provided a special room and other facilities for handling these materials a year or two later arthur a schomburg not yet employed by the new york public library was secured as curator for the department during his years at fisk he laid a basis for a collection not unlike the one he had assembled privately the philosophy of which has already been discussed later the library of willis d weatherford then connected with the ymc a college at nashville was purchased this acquisition gave fisk a negro collection of impressive size subsequent purchases plus exchanges of many duplicates found among the weatherford books and among gifts have given it a continuous growth for several years s e grinstead served the collection as curator two publications important to this report have stemmed from this collection one is mr grinstead bibliography of books by or about the negro the other frances l yocom subject classification of books in this area published by the h w wilson company other college and university libraries major and minor negro collections are also located at such institutions as atlanta university hampton institute virginia union morgan college tuskegee institute dillard university and others the ones at atlanta and at hampton are of major size and the one at dillard appears to be growing rapidly mr tuttle considered its development most promising from a dealer point of view other circumstances confirm this dillard university sponsored extensive studies in the history of negroes in louisiana under the work projects administration workers of the writers program of the work projects administration of virginia prepared a classified catalogue of the negro collection in the collis p huntington library of hampton institute in i this work a thick mimeographed volume lists  annotated items of which  deal with the negro in africa the caribbean area and latin america and the rest with the negro in the united states other public librariesdepending solely on the tuttle files as a barometer one would conclude that the boston athenaeum the cleveland public to a lesser extent the birmingham public and in a different category the newberry in chicago were the most active public libraries in the negro field barring of course the one hundred and thirty fifth street branch in new york city this however is not a complete picture for it says nothing about popular collections of the kind that have been established in the hall branch of the chicago public in the vernon branch of the los angeles system and perhaps in many others none of these would have occasion to do extensive business with a firm like the tuttle company and their occasional purchases provided a basis for no enlightening assumptions also neglected by this reckoning are the public libraries of brooklyn burlington houston providence etc all of which have at one time or another reported considerable resources in the field
 the library quarterly that the newberry library and the boston athenaeum have important strength in this general area could be deduced from the titles of their purchasesoften rare pamphlets and other items generally associated with the more exhaustive collections library of congressat the time of the paris exposition in i dan murray a negro and one of the assistants in the library of congress was asked to prepare an exhibit of negro books and related materials the exhibition turned out to be so impressive by current standards that the collection was kept together when it was returned to washington and continuous additions were made to it during the remainder of murray life since the death of dan murray it has been known as the murray collection naturally thanks to strategic advantages its acquisitions have been impressive a good example of the type of material which seems to flow to that collection has just been announced the complete letters and papers of booker t washington including a wide correspondence with many of the great historical figures of the past generation relating to the activities of tuskegee and the whole scope of negro development in the united states as the repository for all books copyrighted in the united states since july i the library of congress collection is of course complete within that period it is by no means limited to the united states or to the years since i however frederick douglass memorialone of the most interesting and valuable collections of negroana in america is one of the smallest it consists entirely of the writings of frederick douglass and is housed in the memorial home at anacostia dc douglass stature as a negro leader before and after the civil war is constantly rising obscured for a time by the more conciliatory booker t washington he looms up with the developments of recent history this new evaluation has drawn sharp attention to his life and works a calendar of the writings of frederick douglass in the memorial home at anacostia dc was prepared by the district of columbia historical records survey division of professional and service projects of the wpa it is annotated and indexed contains io entries and has a section of documentary references in addition to a foreword by the negro historian carter g woodson and a preface by h b dillard supervisor of the district of columbia historical records survey this small memorial collection housed in a shrine is perhaps a synthesis of all the others their final meaning
