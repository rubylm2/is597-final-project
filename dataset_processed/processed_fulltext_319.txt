writing about science for children millicent e selsam t o write about science for children an author needs to know science to know children and to know how to write particularly to understand how to communicate with children on their level it is natural for children to be curious and to ask questions this is also characteristic of most scientists at work they might be said to have maintained a child curiosity about the world in which they live and their mode of working is to ask questions even as children do the form of questions asked by younger children is most often that of identity seeking children pick up a caterpillar a beetle a shell or the eggs of some sea animal and want to know the name of it having found out the name they lose interest and usually soon forget the name i have learned through the years not to tell them the name now i never know what the object is no matter how familiar i say let find out and look it up with them in a simple guide hoping to encourage the habit of looking up such things for themselves as a help to remembering the name i try to encourage them to do something with the object found if children interests are to be maintained and encouraged to develop it should be possible to incorporate these techniques into the writing of books it was in this way that i was induced to write a book called terry and the caterpillars i had known all my adult life that caterpillars spin cocoons but i had never seen them actually do it opposite me on the island lived a little girl who kept bringing me caterpillars we put some huge ones in jars with some twigs and leaves of the plants on which they were found the following week both of us saw for the first time in our lives the spinning of the cocoon i saw the effect of this simple scientific observation on the child felt the excitement myself and realized that here science met child in a way that could produce a good book but how does the writer communicate the excitement of the discovery it is not enough to say here is an exciting thing see the way a caterpillar spins a cocoon the role of the writer is to write the book so that a child can feel he is participating in an observation or a discovery it should send him out looking for his own caterpillars immediately a good science book is not just a collection of facts the biology text life by george gaylord simpson and collaborators asks are you being a scientist when you count the sand grains on coney island beach no it is true you are gathering facts perhaps carefully but you are probably crazy scientists gather facts that are relative to some theory to be tested or extended they have well formed ideas of what is worth studying at any given time all scientific work is thus approached with an hypothesis in mind the very essence of science is the search for general rules which when found are summarized in laws and theories in biology we can think of generalizations such as the cell doctrine gene theory the theory of evolution for example darwin concept of evo millicent seisam terry and the caterpillars new york harper  row   george gaylord simpson colin s pittendrigh and lewis h tiffany life an introduction to biology new york harcourt brace  world  p  
writing about science for children  lution gave us an understanding of fossils the geologic history of rocks comparative anatomy embryology and the adaptations of animals to their environment this one concept by linking many facts helped to integrate the field of biology the purpose of science books should not be to fill a child head with facts but to give him some idea of the great advances in science made by the linking of many observable facts into fundamental concepts a good science book leads to an appreciation of the methods of science scientists find the answers to their questions by observing and experimenting children are excellent observers and if they are given a chance to look at things themselves they will begin to appreciate the kind of patience and effort that goes into careful observation science books should encourage this habit of careful observation a good book on the seashore should move the reader to go out and examine for himself the wonderful life at the edge of the sea a good astronomy book should turn the reader eye to the sky and make him want to buy a small telescope a good nature book should stimulate a young person to hear see smell and taste things to use all of his senses to observe observation of natural facts should lead to an interest in discovering the cause of the processes and activities observed questions of this kind can best be answered by experiment the late george sarton the famous historian of science had this to say about developing an appreciation of the scientific method in young people one may begin science training with the purely descriptive parts which require only some power of observation and memory thus a good deal of astronomy geology anatomy botany and zoology etc can be explained in a very simple way the fundamental methods of science can be illustrated by means of easy experiments and thus will the spirit of experimental philosophy gradually inform the minds of the pupils it is of course this that matters above all it is perfectly possible and it is not even difficult to inculcate the scientific spirit    upon children in various proportions according to the age and intelligence of each  e  no attempt should be made to teach too many facts there is no point in that one fact well understood if possible by means of personal experiments is more than a hundred learned by rote good science books should certainly avoid incorrect concepts such as teleology which explains everything in nature in terms of purpose statements likes birds suddenly leave one locality and fly hundreds of miles to another place so that they will have food and a warmer climate in the new location seem to close off all further inquiry a great deal of serious scientific study is being devoted to the migration of birds experiments have led to theories about the length of day influencing the reproductive organs and to theories about how the whole process may have originated far back in the sequence of ice age times when birds were forced to move further south a scientific presentation of migration gives the facts as known to date from observation and experimentation gives the best theories available and shows what areas are still to be explored it avoids the easy and incorrect use of words like so that nature wants or prefers etc lucretius the great roman poet of science of the first century bc in his epic poem on the nature of things had this to say on the subject of teleology almost two thousand years ago s george sarton the history of science and the new humanism cambridge mass harvard university press  pp

writing about science for children  bath to rush through the streets of syracuse shouting eureka when he discovered a new physical principle books about science should help young people to see that our human goals must be shaped by science and that science must be enriched by human hopes and ideals with man new control of the forces of nature with atomic power and earth satellitesscience books can help to develop the idea that science is not mere knowledge of things independent of our human purposes or merely a means of giving us material comforts and gadgets but is part of the fabric of our lives the methods of science can be used to create rational attitudes free of superstition and prejudice two subjects where non scientific attitudes are readily observable are evolution and sex without evolution there is no science of biology and yet it is impossible to sell a book about evolution for the elementary grades dinosaurs are acceptable there are plenty of books for younger children on this subject but a careful examination will reveal how few of them make it understood that the age of the dinosaur was a great reptilian upsurge followed by an age in which mammals developed and that this process is part of the evolutionary development of all animals even in textbooks for the sixth seventh and eighth grade the word evolution will not be found although various aspects of the subject may be covered the new revision of the elementary science studies is making a great point of this omission of evolution from the curriculum and new studies will undoubtedly include it but it is not now possible to sell a trade book on evolution to libraries in the same numbers that you can sell any other science book even though it may have good or better reviews there seems to be a wall of prejudice on this subject that is not talked about but which nevertheless operates i can offer as an example a book i wrote entitled around the world with darwin this is a simple account of darwin voyage of the beagle but it has had one third the sale of my other books the same wall operates with books on sex even in animals let alone humans i wrote a book called the courtship of a nimals which was well reviewed and yet this book is selling less than half as many copies as the other books in the same animal behavior series by the time a young person is thirteen or fourteen he can walk into any bookstore and buy a paperback explaining sex from a to z but before that time he cannot even learn about courtship and mating in the animal world and see himself in perspective in the world of nature squeamishness on the part of parents teachers and librarians makes for squeamishness on the part of publishers and so very few books on evolution and sex are published there are many other non scientific attitudes that abound among us but these will decline in proportion to the number of good science books read by the new generation by good science books to repeat i mean those that show the methods of science at work that elucidate basic principles of science and are not a mere assembly of facts that convey something of the beauty and excitement of science and that interest young people in thinking up good questions for new young scientists to test by experiment ew york harper  row  ew york william morrow  co
