lcsh and precis in music a comparison paula beversdorf gabbard by studying examples of their applications by the two major english language bibliographic agencies this article compares the strengths and weaknesses of precis and lcsh as regards books about music quantitative analysis reveals that the number of precis subject statements exceeds lc subject headings except with more generic works qualitative analysis reveals serious problems with the terminology in both systems lcsh frequently fails to combine unrelated subjects into a single heading while subject statements in precis are sometimes so long that significant aspects of the work cannot be adequately integrated if the strengths of the selected subject entries of each system were combined the result could be an improvement over each system alone especially in an online catalog with the capability of single and random word order searches introduction most researchers librarians and staff in american academic libraries have grown familiar but not satisfied with many aspects of the library of congress subject headings although precis never appeared to be a panacea it did seem to promise more than lcsh currently offers this article investigates how well the british library application of precis as compared with the library of congress use of their subject headings deals with music subjects a previously neglected area of research in fact of the articles that deal with single subjects at all the majority are in the natural or social sciences the remainder address the visual arts including the printed index of the national film board of canada and these provide few hints of how precis approached music    this article grew out of research done while i was attending columbia university school of library service i wish to thank both j stevens and j kaufman for their encouragement and help in the writing of this article  music library state university of new york stony brook new york  library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved      
lcsh and precis in music  research any thorough comparison between applications of lcsh and precis must follow an exposition of the fundamental differences between the two systems unlike lcsh precis is not simply a vocabulary list rather it is a methodology for organizing subject statements by contrast lcsh lacks any true theoretical foundation  p  lcsh has a controlled vocabulary that has grown so unwieldy that changes have become problematic consequently much of its language is antiquated especially for the average user precis by contrast has no vocabulary limitations per se the indexer or cataloger simply constructs his string of terms from the list of terms that have been used before or if necessary he can develop his own terms every precis term and cross reference is assigned a number which makes word changes quite simple when the system is online e svenonius and h schmierer explain that precis is capable of describing multielement works while lcsh tends to be capable of describing only multitopic works a multitopic work treats a number of discrete subjects each of which may be denoted specifically by a separate index term a multielement work on the other hand treats of subjects which are not discrete but are so intimately bound together that a string of interconnected terms is required to denote the work specifically one of the criticisms leveled at lcsh is that the nature of its index terms is such that multielement works must be treated as multitopic works  p  in my own findings the british library application of precis could not be accused of the converse but it did frequently ignore the multiplicity of multitopic works perhaps the indexers and catalogers of the british library preferred not to assign more than one string to a single work precis descriptors are usually more specific than their lcsh counterparts which are frequently so ill defined as to inspire students at yale to complain that lc subject headings are frequently too general to help them find material on needed topics  p  on the other hand precis can be guilty of excessive specificity weintraub suggests that precis detail could make a generic search problematic  pp  it is important to remember that undergraduates and nonscholars are the heaviest users of subject catalogs in libraries several studies have shown that there is an inverse relationship between the dependence on subject searching and the user level of expertise  p  the frequent victorian terminology in lcsh is unfamiliar to the typical subject searcher in contrast the brtitish library application of precis uses current language that would more likely occur to most searchers only a few obscure britishisms appear in the british library use of precis to
 the library quarterly baffle the american user frequently the lcsh red book is placed on or near subject catalogs in libraries it is rarely used by anyone other than the library staff as a result the convenience of lcsh controlled vocabulary is ignored the scholars i discovered usually agree that precis is an improvement over lcsh but some are more guarded in their enthusiasm many feel that there is an urgent need for a readily available thesaurus  p  some others have expressed concern over the bulkiness of the system and they have concluded that it is unsuitable for a manual catalog or index  p  still others believe it is a complex system too difficult for everyone to master and too expensive to adopt  p  but most scholars laud precis cook writes for example precis pre coordinates in a rather elegant way a sophisticated combination of natural language and controlled vocabulary and through its reliance on the syntax of language provides a logic not hitherto found in a general system of subject analysis  p  weintraub looks to the day when precis is online so that we can have a record of all search attempts and can then learn from such data more than we presently know concerning the appropriate lead terms and forms of subject names  p  someday we will also know how well the subject vocabulary matches users search vocabulary up to this point any evaluative analysis of the choice and order of terms selected by using lcsh and precis can be only subjective this article undertakes to compare how subject entries for works about music have been established through lcsh as opposed to how they have been established by the british library application of precis for the sake of brevity i will simply use the word precis when referring to its application by the british library methodology i began my research by gathering a group of cataloged entries dealing exclusively with music from works found in the  british national bibliography bnb index under music and in the  bnb subjects in the  dewey class field in choosing  i was able to compile a relatively current group of works that were not so current as to fail to be in the desired american bibliographic sources with each document i noted the bibliographic information as well as the precis strings i  i am greatly indebted to p richmond for her methodology and organization i have relied on her work in this and the following two sections  pp

 the library quarterly qualitative analysis for qualitative analysis the small sample of  works provides good examples of the strengths and weaknesses of both precis and lcsh example  a blc race steve t dear music lover d  precis  music lcsh  music addresses essays lectures  music anecdotes facetiae satire etc several works have only one term in precis this is peculiar since the additional information provided in example i by lcsh proves helpful precis could have added personal observations as it has in other examples this would have made the focus of the work cited more understandable and it would likely have been remembered by the typical subject searcher on the other hand by attempting to avoid single term headings lcsh frequently resorts to phrases that lose their value by being overused for example history and criticism or at worst are unlikely to be consulted by the untrained user for example anecdotes facetiae satire etc example a a editor stanley sadie t blc the new grove dictionary of music and musicians d   precis  music encyclopaedias lcsh  music dictionaries  music bio bibliography example b a blc roche jerome t a dictionary of early music from the troubadours to monteverdi d  precis  music   encyclopacdias lcsh  music dicionaries english precis frequently has dates following the lead term in theory dates should be helpful but in practice entries with dates example b cannot be interfiled with equivalent entries without dates example a if a catalog index or database grew large the distance between musicencyclopaedias and music   encyclopaedias would make ac a  author ut  uniform title t  title d  dewey classification number b  main entry according to bnb lc  main entry according to lc cataloging
lcsh and precis in music  cess to both entries unlikely once one had been found the wollongong report expresses concern over this problem it illustrates a situation in which a student searched under the term victorian and found nothing in the precis catalog  p  the decision made by the creators of precis to avoid this sort of terminology may prove troublesome if a reference structure from names of historic periods to their corresponding dates were included the problem might be alleviated somewhat yet each group of dates used in precis strings is unique to the book described which makes it unlikely that such cross references would take care of the entire problem the span of dates needed by the searcher would not always match those of the book precis is describing the searcher more likely would try to accommodate his dates to some sort of numerical or historical logic unfortunately with precis this logic does not work precis approach to dates differs radically from lcsh approach when using chronological subdivisions lcsh names historic periods in its cross reference structure and then divides dates by century lest we forget however lcsh is flawed in these examples a and b as well why do they distinguish only one dictionary as english when they are both in english for that matter why has lcsh decided that instead of dealing with the distinction between dictionaries and encyclopedias they simply never use a form subdivision encyclopedias even though this is certainly what any student unfamiliar with lc peculiarities would think to look under for such a searcher trying to predict what subject headings lc will assign a work is frequently more difficult than predicting the weather example  a lc american society of composers authors and publishers t b ascap biographical dictionary d  precis  music united states composers organizations american society of composers authors and publishers members biographies  composers music united states organizations american society of composers authors and publishers members biographies  american society of composers authors and publishers members biographies lcsh  american society of composers authors and publishers biography  music united states bio bibliography every precis entry makes it explicitly clear what this book is about biographies of ascap members the first lc subject heading on the other hand leaves room for confusion one might imagine that it is a
 the library quarterly biography of ascap founding members the second lc subject heading fails to define the book biographic scope beyond geographic limits but we must not forget that lcsh was designed for a one step search process consequendy the full citation usually exists in card catalogs under each lc subject heading however with an online catalog each search would probably become a multiple step process exposing the ambiguities of many lc subject headings if precis were used the online searcher could rely on the subject entry alone for his initial decision as to whether the work is what is needed example  ab national trust alc russell raymond t a catalogue of early keyboard instruments the benton fletcher collection d   precis  fenton house exhibits keyboard string instruments collections benton fletcher collection catalogues  keyboard instruments exhibits fenton house keyboard stnrng instruments collections benton fletcher collection catalogues  benton fletcher collection exhibits fenton housecaalogues  london camden london borough houses fenton house exhibits keyboard string instruments collections benton fletcher collection catalogues  camden london borough houses fenton house exhibits keyboard string instruments collections benton fletcher collectioncatalogues lcsh v keyboard instruments catalogs and collections  benton fletcher collection the large group of precis entries in example  may be more helpful to an englishman than to anyone else people who seek for example exhibition catalogs of early keyboard instruments would not look under camden and perhaps not even london during their subject search however those who want for example to find all information on what has been exhibited at the fenton house would have easy access through this precis subject entry which is not duplicated in the lc subject headings example a a blc strauss richard   ut correspondence english

lcsh and precis in music  precis gives a much more thorough analysis of the works and it presents usable search terms in examples a and b lcsh on the other hand gives the absolute minimum example a a blc ammer christine t unsung a history of women in american music d  precis  music american music role of women    women role in american music    american music role of women   lcsh  women musicians  women composers  musicians united states example b a blc sampson henry t t blacks in blackface a source book on early black musical shows d  precis  musical shows featuring coloured artists american musical shows featuring coloured artists    american musical shows featuring coloured artists   lcsh  musical revues comedy etcunited states  afro american entertainers example c a blc handy d antoinette t black women in american bands and orchestras d  precis  bands music united states negro women instrumentalists to   orchestras united states negro women instrumentalists to   negro instrumentalists bands and orchestras music united states negro women instrumentalists to   women instrumentalists bands and orchestras music united states negro women instrumentalists to  lcsh  afro american women musicians in these examples precis exhibits serious problems in example a when it is not in the lead term women is hidden alphabetically behind
 the library quarterly the words role of or role in there are many entries under the term music and yet one of the most important subject terms in this entry women is alphabetically hidden behind four words other than music the problem is not much better in the entry beginning with american music a similar problem is evident in example b but added to that is a problem with terminology example b uses the term coloured but c uses the term negro in example c there are no lead terms that have negro and women next to each other even though they are among the most important terms in the work these examples demonstrate one of precis biggest problems with long entries certain terms of significance are separated and can never be recombined in any order of importance consequently when the entries are alphabetically filed some importnt words are rendered insignificant because of their position the lcsh entries in examples a c are sometimes too few in number but except for musical revues    they are reasonable example a a blc herman gary t rockoll babylon d  precis  rock music stars  stars rock music lcsh  rock music history and criticism exampk b a blc john elton t the elton john tapes d  precis  pop music english pop music john elton interviews  john elton english pop music inteviews lcsh  john elton  rock musicians interviews the peculiarities in the precis terms here may simply be a result of britishisms it seems as if pop music and rock music are used in different circumstances but for reasons that are obscure is stars more a british term than an american one on the other hand lcsh is too vague there are several examples throughout this study like the one shown in the first lc entry of example b the names are alone without any further distinguishing terms why does lcsh choose not to add more distinguishing words or phrases such as interviews or correspondence diaries etc to personal names

lcsh and precis in music  accompanies lc subject headings in traditional card catalogs third in a world where interdisciplinary research is growing ever more common lcsh will become progressively more problematic because of the reluctance of lc to add multielement headings to its thesaurus precis on the other hand adjusts itself easily to interdisciplinary studies if precis were purged of its language inconsistencies and redundancies if it would allow for random word searches from all the words in its string so that the arrangement of words in longer strings would not be a problem if a thesaurus were readily available and if american terminology were exchanged for british then it would be a grand system for online catalogs in american libraries however as it stands now precis would not be a much better solution than lcsh when used in card catalogs or in any catalog where full bibliographic information accompanies each subject entry however there are still some areas where precis would be an improvement over lcsh even in such card catalogs for example lcsh and precis often have the same lead terms in their subject entries yet while precis frequently chooses to define the statement further lcsh often overuses these lead terms as the complete subject statement in these cases searches through precis would be more productive the extremely long precis strings on the other hand which by their length obscure their major subject elements would be frequently less satisfying than their lcsh counterparts during a subject search if the strengths of each system were efficiently combined to be used for single step searches the result would be an improvement over either system alone ideally the two subject approaches could be combined so that the strengths of each system could complement each other lcsh could make multielement works accessible and precis could make multitopic works accessible if combined in an online catalog with single and random word order search capabilities lcsh problems of unpredictable word inversions as well as the problems with precis longer strings would be alleviated this combined with title terms was recommended in the wollongong report  pp    it is an exciting but expensive suggestion references  fawcett trevor subject indexing in the visual arts arts librariesjournal      dykstra mary a complete delivery service for canadian non print media canadian journal of information science  may     dykstra mary access to film information an indexing and retrieval system for the national film board of canada halifax nova scotia dalhousie university
