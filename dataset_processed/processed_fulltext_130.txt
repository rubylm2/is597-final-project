an early american essay on classification by frederic vinton n preparing for the dictionary of american biography a biographical sketch of frederic vinton i had occasion to examine a manuscript catalog of a large private library in st louis on which dr vinton worked from i  i until  the catalog is now the property of the princeton university library the preface to this volume proved to be of great interest as it contains what is so far as i know the earliest discussion of library classification written by an american it is in any event the original of the ideas on which was based the classification which vinton prepared in ii for the newly established bates hall in the boston public library and was the basis for his later work at the library of congress and as librarian of the college of new jerseyames thayer gerould preface to the classified catalog of alfred vinton  library i was not the hasty product of a day but the well ripened fruit of wise delay in shaping the bibliographical scheme here presented i had the advantage of consulting those of horne prepared for the library of the british museum of barbier intended for the library of the council of state at paris of namur designed for the royal library at brussels and of brunet arranged for the bookseller and the lover of books the enumeration of these celebrated names may cause surprise that my attempt should have been made at all for why should an ordinary person waste time in the needless labor of preparing a mere schedule anticipated by celebrated productions and serving only to show the presumption of its author it was not with the idea of rivalling these honored models that i undertook the task now completed but because i did not find them suited to my humble design the difference is so vast between the necessities of the great li
an early american essasy on classification  braries for which those masters labored and the requisitions of this modest collection of books that it may readily be conceived a harder task to adapt one of the great systems to so different a design than by selecting from among their features to compile a new series of classes adjusted to the specific occasion when the titles of half a million volumes are to be brought together in one classification it is obvious that the subdivisions should be very many and very minute while a collection of but seven thousand volumes gathered for his own pleasure by an unprofessional student would probably be much less various and might present no occasion for some important departments what is here submitted pretends to no greater amplitude or preciseness than suits its own occasion and aims at no higher excellence than correctness and intelligibility brunet has adopted what he calls the bibliographical system of the parisian booksellers attributing to it in his introduction an honorable antiquity it is substantially the same which has been approved by the trustees of the british museum after having been carefully modified by mr t hartwell horne it is more generally adopted than any other and this is no mean advantage in itself the principal change proposed by mr horne was the division of the class sciences and arts into two six classes being thus made out of five i have not ventured upon further innovations which the great bibliographers of europe have not proposed but even while deferring to their authority i have not been able to feel that all parts of their work were harmonious especially in the class history a variety of changes seem desirable i cannot recognize the propriety of treating as a mere introduction to history that large mass of books which contain voyages and travels it is true that the narrative of events derives indispensable illustration from the description of the countries where they occurred but similar bands of relationship connect the whole round of knowledge classification consists not merely in uniting things which resemble but in separating things which differ but if we should always amalgamate where we perceive a resemblance we should end by having no classifi
 the library quarterly cation at all the introduction which brunet and horne and namur and barbier have prefixed to history is as large as history itself at the same time it is impossible to keep down the feeling that these books are not history though they stand under the name the introduction seems like an enormous portico built of materials diverse from those of the main edifice would it not be better to make of it a new class under the name of geography as if to make amends for intruding upon this department what does not belong there bibliographers have removed from it much which really does belong there can any good reason be given why church history should not stand beneath the same head with that history of nations with which it is so closely connected yet we find it in the systems as a department under theology of course this is done for the convenience of theologians and is a relic from the times when bibliography accommodated itself to the professions it is for the same reason that oriental and hellenistic philology the criticism of the sacred text and formerly canon law have been included under theology from a similar regard to convenience the history of printing has been attached to bibliography for which m hesse says there is no better reason than for connecting the art of the armourer with the art of war in general the history of each art and science has been added to the treatises whose subject is the art or science itself i admit that on the shelves of a library it may be convenient to find such books in contiguity but is it as manifest that the titles of such books ought to be arranged on the same pages of a bibliographical system the effect of so doing is to terminate logical sequence and interrupt the natural order of thought it is as easy to find such titles collected under the head of literary history as scattered among the topics to which they refer m albert remarks of the prevailing system that having been born in a printer shop it has always shown signs of its commercial character perhaps these are some of the appearances to which he refers practical men may be allowed to sneer at the bibliographical systems prepared by phi
an early american essay on clssification  losophers pointing to bacon leibnitz and coleridge as examples but if the order of thought be wholly disregarded it will be found that convenience itself has been sacrificed my distribution of the divisions and my allotment of spaces under the head theology differs from those i have referred to bibliographers appear to have viewed this department from a literary stand point and to have treated dogmatic divinity in a perfunctory manner the monkish origin of the prevailing systems seems to be betrayed in the prominence given to the fathers the schoolmen and the antiquities of christianity the idea of scientific dependence among doctrines appears to be overlooked amid the meagre disorderliness we find when i began this classification my ideas of jurisprudence were so crude that i despaired of making any intelligent of its topics it is to hoffmann legal outlines that i owe the gleams of light which seemed at length to penetrate the gloom but i fear that my arrangement of them still gives proof that my knowledge of the subject was collected for the nonce finding theology placed foremost in many bibliographical systems and jurisprudence next the reader is led to expect medicine as the third class he may inquire with surprise and if a physician with displeasure why the subjects which his profession investigates are sunk below the level assigned the other two and obscurely buried among the ordinary sciences the proper defence of bibliographers appears to be that medicine finds its work and its instruments among the subjects of natural science while law and divinity do not arranging medical knowledge by itself would therefore break the bonds which unite the sciences and disjoin things naturally allied theology ranks first because its truths are of prime importance and such as reason could not attain jurisprudence comes next because it acquaints us with the laws of men as revelation had disclosed the commands of god science or the knowledge of the mind of society and of nature is the next concern of man and the gradation continues in a progress from the graver to the elegant departments of learning in the department of literature i have sometimes depart
so the library uarterly ed from the practice which my predecessors had established a usage common among them is to bring together under the one designation poets all the literary men who have composed epics ballads lyrics satires dramas and tales in verse these are very different sorts of composition why should they not be distinguished if rhythmic structure were assigned as the ground for their being classed together it would be easy to point to comedy as a department where rhyme is not employed verse is the common dress of poets but they do not all or always wear it i have used poetry to denote a department of literature without pretending to apply it with precision and i have tried to mark out some of its provinces several bibliographers have contented themselves with geographical distinctions not only of poets but among orators and romancers but it appears to me that the course of a river or diversities of speech are much less proper as a basis for bibliographical divisions than differences of aim or of execution in respect to the works produced nor have i thought best to set what are called the classic authors by themselves however peculiar those illustrious works may be in respect to their age their language and their merit it seems better to assign them place from regard to the sort of composition alone however strange it may appear to find among modern novels the cyropoedia of xenophon it is just as much a romance as emilius and sophia no one would object to seeing among modern geometers the elements of euclid or the conics of apollonius there is just as little reason for refusing a place among amusing tales to the thiopics of heliodorus or the golden ass of apuleius the classic authors are not all eminent for merit and if they were such a ground of separation is never proposed among the moderns the languages in which they wrote have never ceased to be used in the learned world so that no boundary can well be fixed on that account their authors differ from their modern imitators in respect to race and so do the english from the germans and frenchmen from italians but if the literature of every people is to be separately arranged in classes what augmentation of labor is produced at the british museum and the
an early american essay on classification  bibliotheque royale how much better to classify all books with reference to their subjects and mode of treatment neglecting every other consideration notwithstanding the assiduity with which this classification has been elaborated i am haunted by the apprehensions that my system will be found too complicated for practical usefulness such is the number of subdivisions and so minute are the steps of their gradation that i fear it will often be difficult to determine under which of them the desired information must be sought like those variable keys meant to turn the many bolts of which the locks on the doors of bank vaults consist this system may be found to require of him who would use it a knowledge of the very combinations employed by him who contrived it a sentence found in m hesse valuable little work called bibliotheconomie often dismays my mind the more simple a system is and the more rational in developing by subdivisions the nature of the principal classes the more nearly it will agree with the methods which every logical mind pursues but as soon as one begins to lose himself in the subtle complicated and doubtful mazes of metaphysics he labors only for himself and those who have travelled the same road yet my bibliographical scheme does not consist of more numerous parts or more finely attenuated than those which have been prepared for the great libraries of europe the whole number of divisions which i have employed is five hundred brunet has adopted at least twelve hundred namur two thousand and horne about the same turning now from the consideration of the system itself to my application of it to the library for which it was prepared i suppose that the disposition i have made of many books may appear extraordinary if not absurd i have endeavored to discover the closest analogies those which spring out of the heart of each subject in so doing there is danger i admit of showing the acuteness of a metaphysician rather than the simplicity of him who desires to be useful there are however three general considerations to which i would entreat attention whenever any singularity in the following pages attracts attention first
o the library quarterly the variety of mental constitution leads different men to take different views of the same thing secondly a book may treat several subjects in successive parts and it may be difficult to say what is the main purpose or principal topic in it thirdly the mature reflection which a librarian should give to every part of his work may fix as the true place of a book a position which would not occur on a cursory survey to these i may add that i did not think it best in so brief a system to form a new department every time i perceived a specific difference brunet observes that the subject an author has named in his title is sometimes that with which he has occupied himself the least this diversity of parts makes it necessary to refer to it under many different heads i have not resorted to the common expedient of classing such works together as polygraphical they may often contain important discussions or information which ought to be referred to under its appropriate department i have thought it would be discreditable to my industry or my acuteness to subjoin a numerous list of such insolubles to the limbo of miscellanea i have condemned only nine titles so complex that they would otherwise require almost as many references as the pages contained in the books so small a satellite however chaotic revolving about the cosmos which i have reduced to order in the following pages cannot intercept much of the light which flows from the rest of the system but even when a book has a single design harmoniously developed it may be necessary to refer to it under several heads a work on agricultural chemistry belongs both among works on the art of husbandry and among treatises on the science of inorganic chemistry a book on ethnology belongs both to natural history and to the history of nations double references of this sort therefore do not necessarily show indecision of mind in him who made them i feel anxious to make a special apology for one portion of my work and i do it the more readily because the consciousness that error was least to have been expected there suggests the idea that undiscovered faults probably lurk elsewhere whoever attempts to trace the applicability of the divisions found
