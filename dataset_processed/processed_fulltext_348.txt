similarities in circulation patterns among public library branches serving diverse populations john r ottensmann raymond e gnat and michael e gleeson this article examines the circulation of adult books in public library branches and the distribution of circulation across subject categories for the indianapolismarion county public library as found in many other studies levels of circulation varied widely among branches and were related to the characteristics of the populations served the distributions of the subjects of the books circulated did not vary greatly between branches or between groups of branches classified by social and economic characteristics both traditional statistical measures and the index of dissimilarity were used to ascertain the degree of differences in circulation patterns among the branches in only some subject categories were branch circulation levels related to various social and economic characteristics of the populations served public library branches in large cities serve very diverse populations the areas served by individual branches can vary greatly in terms of the incomes occupations educational levels and ethnicity of their residents these differences can be important for the libraries affecting service needs and circulation levels in branches serving various areas what is less clear is the effect that such population differences have on the types of materials circulated by such public library branches given the importance of the social and economic characteristics of service area populations for matters such as levels of library utilization it might be plausible to assume that branches serving very different service area populations might exhibit very different circulation patterns one can equally well hypothesize that while readership levels may differ among different populations for those who actually use the libraries and read the books the types of books which they read might not vary greatly  indiana university school of public and environmental affairs businessspea building   west michigan street indianapolis indiana    indianapolis marion county public library indianapolis indiana   indiana university school of public and environmental affairs businessspea building   west michigan street indianapolis indiana   library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved      
 the library quarterly the nature of circulation patterns and the differences or similarities across branches are important for public library systems in meeting the needs of their patrons decisions about collection development and the allocation of materials acquisition budgets should depend upon the demands exhibited in the various branches indeed questions of whether acquisition is best handled at the branch level or on a centralized basis may depend upon the degrees of similarity of circulation patterns across the various branches this research examines the patterns of circulation of adult books across the twenty one branches serving local areas of the indianapolismarion county public library rates of circulation vary widely among the branches which serve very diverse populations however the distributions of circulation across various categories of adult books were very similar among the various branches we found that those persons who checked out and read books tended to read very similar types of materials without regard to the characteristics of the populations served by the branches furthermore circulation patterns in the branches were only weakly related to the social and economic characteristics of the populations served by the branches the following section of this article reviews prior studies of public library use we then present the circulation data and the service area characteristics for the branch libraries in indianapolis that are used for the subsequent analysis next we examine the variation in overall circulation levels among the branches and the relationships of these levels to the characteristics of the populations in the areas served we then address the central question of this article to what extent are patterns of circulation the distribution of circulation across different categories of books similar or different among the branches this question is addressed using both traditional statistical tests and a more direct measure called the index of dissimilarity finally we examine the relationships between branch circulation patterns and the social and economic characteristics of the populations in the areas served by the branches prior studies of public library use many studies have examined levels of public library use and have compared these to the characteristics of individual users or the populations of the areas served by the libraries these studies generally have shown various demographic characteristics especially educational levels to be strongly related to library use little however has been done to examine variations in the types of materials used by different populations the greatest number of studies involve examinations of library use

 the library quarterly in higher status occupations and higher proportions of automobile ownership far less research has been undertaken to examine the types of materials used by public library patrons and how this might or might not vary with the characteristics of the populations served levy meltsner and wildavsky  p  reported a study by michael teitz and his students that examined requests and borrowing in the oakland branches using books classified by the major  level dewey decimal classifications they found by and large the same demands in all branches since oakland population manifests considerable variety and there are geographic concentrations of groups by race income and education they concluded that the library attracted a certain type of user who is found to some extent in all areas of the city but there are more of these typical users in some neighborhoods circulation statistics show they are found disproportionately in areas with high income and educational levels circulation is high where they are concentrated and low where they are not they also did a more detailed comparison of two branches one high income and one low income examining circulation books received and book orders filled the two branches exhibited general similarities in most categories but the high income branch showed a stronger preference for fiction while the low income branch preferred books on sociology and government with a strong emphasis on books on jobs and careers they concluded that this more refined analysis showed that reader preferences do differ significantly from one part of the city to another contradicting their earlier conclusion  pp   given the conflicting results from these analyses one is left very uncertain as to whether or not the types of materials circulated by branch libraries varies significantly among branches the question which this article seeks to answer branch library circulation rates and service area characteristics this research examines the patterns of circulation of adult books of various types across the twenty one branches of the indianapolismarion county library system this section begins by describing the data on circulation used in the analysis it then examines the social and economic characteristics of the areas served by those branches circulation rates the analysis covers the twenty one branch libraries in indianapolis the central library is excluded as its larger collection serves the entire city
similarities in circulation patterns  for more specialized needs also excluded is the extension division of the library which provides specialized services to specific populations the source of the circulation data for the analysis is the set of monthly reports on circulation for the year  for each of the branches these reports were generated by the clsi computerized circulation system and provide detailed breakdowns of circulation by over two hundred subject categories the analysis focuses on the circulation of adult books in the fiction and dewey decimal categories the circulation of juvenile books and nonprint materials was not considered the detailed circulation information for all of  was aggregated into a smaller set of subject categories that are equivalent to the set of categories used by the library for materials acquisition budgeting for the central library this aggregation was done to reduce the number of categories to a more manageable number the materials acquisition budgeting categories were used because these categories are significant for decision making in the library system analyses comparable to those reported in this article were also done with the original unaggregated data and produced results comparable to those being reported here table  lists the subject categories used in the analysis and the dewey decimal ranges or other subject descriptors associated with each of the categories this table also lists the total circulation of the twenty one branches in each category along with the percentage distribution the total volume of circulation of adult books in these branches during  was about one and one half million adult fiction accounted for the largest share of the circulation over one quarter of the total mysteries represented an additional  percent of the total branch circulation service area characteristics to identify those census tracts primarily served by each of the branches the indianapolis marion county library conducted a study of the distribution of individual patron registration by census tract these branch service areas identified by the library were used for the analyses comparing circulation to the social and economic characteristics of the populations served by the branches data on selected social and economic characteristics of the populations in the census tracts were obtained from the  census of population and housing  variables were selected that are fairly standard measures of population characteristics and that the literature suggests may be related to library use these tract level data were aggregated to the service areas for the twenty one branches five measures of the population characteristics of the service areas are considered age race education income and occupation the general age structure of the population is measured by the percentage of the population aged eighteen

similarities in circulation patterns  several caveats need to be mentioned regarding the use of this service area data first the data are from the  census and are being compared with  circulation data some changes will have occurred in neighborhood populations during the eight year period but such changes would be relatively modest in most areas the use of the tract data from the decennial census is generally required in these types of analyses and the relatively minor changes in tract characteristics caused by such lags do not create problems in most cases especially with tract data aggregated to larger areas for a discussion of the extent of changes in census tract data over the ten year periods from census to census see john ottensmann   a second issue involves the fact that the service areas identified for the branches will not precisely identify the populations served by each branch for several reasons first the area in which each branch is dominant will not coincide exactly with census tract boundaries second all of the persons in any given area will not use the same library patrons are free to borrow from any branch so service areas will overlap as the patrons select different branches thus in comparing branch circulation to service area characteristics the comparison is to the populations in the areas which the branches predominantly serve the comparison of branch circulation to the service area characteristics is appropriate for examining the relationship of branches to their potential patron populations whether or not served also the effects of errors caused by overlaps in service areas and by the fact that service areas do not conform to tract boundaries will be minimized because adjacent census tracts usually but not always have similar population characteristics table  presents the social and economic characteristics of the populations in each of the twenty one branch service areas it is readily apparent that there are wide variations in the service area characteristics as would be expected in a large heterogeneous metropolitan area age shows the smallest differences but even there the percentage of the population aged eighteen and over ranges from  to nearly  percent the percentage of the population that is black in the service areas varies from virtually none to over  percent the service areas with the leasteducated population had only  percent of all adults graduated from high school while at the other extreme in the best educated service area over  percent of adults had graduated from high school mean family incomes ranged from a low of about  to a high of over  over two and one half times as great finally the percentage of employed persons in white collar occupations was as low as  percent in one service area and over  percent in another one way analyses of variance using census tracts as the units of analysis were conducted to determine whether the differences between mean characteristics

similarities in circulation patterns  to affect patterns of branch circulation to the extent that the social and economic differences in the populations served created such differences two measures of branch circulation performance were considered for this analysis the first is the total adult book circulation divided by the total population of the service area aged eighteen and over a measure of the extent to which the adult population is using the library the second is the total circulation divided by the branch adult book stock the turnover rate a measure of the extent to which the library is being used the first measure of circulation per adult population is an approximation given that the delineated service areas can only approximate the population served by any branch as discussed above nevertheless it provides a rough measure of the extent to which the adult populations in the service areas are using their libraries these circulation rates circulation per adult population and circulation per book stock are reported for the individual branches in table  immediately noticeable is the very wide variation in these rates across the branches the mean circulation divided by service area adult population is  but the branches range from a low of  to a high of  with a standard deviation of  likewise the turnover rates for the adult book stock range from  to  with a nmean value of  annual circulations per volume and a standard deviation of  the relationships between the branch circulation rates and the service area characteristics were examined using correlation analysis table  presents the correlations across the twenty one branches of these measures of circulation performance with the branch service area characteristics these and subsequent correlation coefficients reported in this article are all pearson product moment correlations all of these correlation coefficients are statistically significant at the  level the strongest relationships were with the education income and occupational characteristics of the service areas the correlations of these variables with the circulation per adult population are all over  and the correlations with the turnover rate all exceed  branches in which the service area populations had higher levels of socioeconomic status as measured by these variables had higher levels of circulation on the other hand branches with higher black populations had lower levels of circulation indicated by the negative correlations though the results were not quite as strong the higher the proportion of the population aged eighteen and over the higher the adult circulation as well branch circulation performance and the social and economic characteristics of the branch service areas vary significantly from branch to branch and these are strongly related to one another thus if service area characteristics were to affect the types of books circulated by branch

 the library quarterly branch form a large contingency table thirty one subject categories by twenty one branches with the frequency of circulation for each subject category in each branch as such the procedures used for the analysis of contingency tables are appropriate for examining the relationship between subject categories and branches such procedures can be used to address two questions is there a statistically significant difference in circulation patterns among branches and what is the strength of that relationship a chi square test is appropriate for determining whether the differences among branches in the pattern of circulation across subject categories is statistically significant the value of chi square for this test is  with  degrees of freedom which is statistically significant at the  level the existence of such a statistically significant relationship is not however very meaningful in this case the contingency table has an n of over one and one half million cases making it certain that virtually any differences in circulation pattern by branch could not be due to sampling variability more useful with such a contingency table is a measure of the strength of the relationship between subject category and branch that is the extent to which the branch affects the pattern of circulation across the subject categories a variety of measures of the strength of relationships in contingency tables is available the lambda statistic is commonly used and has the advantage of being interpretable as the proportional reduction of error in predicting frequencies in one category that can be obtained through knowledge of the second category in the present case the question is whether knowledge of the branch can reduce the error in the prediction of the frequency distribution of circulation across subject categories the value of lambda in this case with subject category as the dependent variable is   that is knowledge of the branch would result in less than a  percent reduction in error in predicting the circulation by subject category similar low values for the strength of the relationship are obtained by examining other measures of relationship in contingency tables the result of the contingency table analysis is therefore not very informative the relationship between branch and subject category is statistically significant given the extremely large number of cases however the strength of this relationship is extremely small correlation analysis represents an alternative approach using traditional statistical measures to examine the similarities and differences in circtulation patterns across branches since the interest is in the difference or similarity in the circulation patterns across subject categories among branches the correlation coefficients across subject categories were calculated for each pair of branches each of these correlation coefficients indicates the extent to which the circulation pattern across
similarities in circulation patterns  the subject categories in one branch is similar to the circulation pattern in the second branch a correlation of  would mean that the two branches have an identical distribution of circulation across the subject categories while a correlation of zero would imply no relationship between the two patterns this correlation analysis produced  unique correlation coefficients for the relationships between the different combinations of the twentyone branches given the size of this correlation matrix it is not presented in this article the mean value of these correlation coefficients was  meaning that the circulation in one branch was very highly related to the circulation in the second branch when compared across the categories the smallest correlation coefficient was  and the largest was  only three of the correlation coefficients were less than  while  of the  exceeded  thus the pattern of circulation across the subject categories in any one branch was very highly related to the circulation in another branch for all the pairs of branches tests for statistical significance are inappropriate in this case the usual test of significance for a correlation coefficient examines whether that coefficient is statistically significant from zero that is whether there is any relationship all of the correlation coefficients examined were highly significant in this sense but this only means that the circulation in one branch had some relationship to the circulation in another branch there is no test of statistical significance for whether the circulation patterns across pairs of branches are identical for any correlation that is not  represents a statistically significant difference from an identical pattern while the contingency table analysis shows there are statistically significant differences in circulation patterns between branches those differences are very small correlations of circulation across subject categories between branches are very high indicating very significant similarities in branch circulation patterns developing a more accurate picture requires a direct measure of the similarities and dissimilarities in the circulation patterns indexes of dissimilarity what is required is a measure that will allow examination of the extent to which the circulation pattern of any branch library differs from the overall patterns for all of the branches or from other individual branches the circulation pattern for any branch or for the total can be expressed as a percentage distribution of the total number of items circulated across the various subject categories therefore comparing these circulation patterns calls for a measure capable of comparing two percentage distributions across the same set of categories
 the library quarterly a wide variety of indices have been developed to measure the degree of similarity or difference between two percentage distributions see for example philip coulter  pp   otis dudley duncan and beverly duncan developed the measure which they called the index of dissimilarity d which was originally used for measuring residential segregation by race within urban areas  in measuring segregation the index compares the distributions of blacks and whites across small areas within a city the duncans index of dissimilarity is an attractive choice for the present application as it is a straightforward easy tounderstand measure that provides for the direct comparison of two percentage distributions across the same set of categories it also possesses the advantage that the values of the index can be readily interpreted as the percentage of the elements in one distribution that would have to be moved to other categories in order to make that distribution identical to a second distribution the index of dissimilarity is defined as one half the sum of the absolute values of the differences between two percentage distributions d   xi lxi yil  where xi is the percentage in category i in the first distribution and y is the percentage in category i in the second distribution with the summation over all of the categories for example suppose we have the percentage distributions of circulation across three subject categories for one branch and for the total circulation of all of the branches percentage of total circulation subject absolute category branch a all branches difference value                 total     some of the differences in percent of total circulation between branch a and the total circulation for all of the branches will be positive and some will be negative taking the absolute values makes all of the numbers positive the sum of the absolute values of the differences in this
similarities in circulation patterns  example is  one half of this is  the value of the index of dissimilarity the index of dissimilarity can range from zero to  the index will have the minimum value of zero no dissimilarity when the two percentage distributions are identical in comparing circulation distributions this would mean that the percentages of the total circulation in each subject category would be the same for both distributions the index will have the maximum value of  total dissimilarity in the case when the two percentage distributions have nonzero percentages in different categories in comparing circulation distributions this extreme situation would occur only if circulation in each subject category occurred only in one distribution but not the other or put another way the two distributions have circulation in mutually exclusive subsets of the subject categories perhaps the most important feature of the index of dissimilarity is that it is a measure of the percentage of the units in one distribution that would have to be reallocated among categories to make the distribution identical to the second distribution in the simple example given above the index of dissimilarity is  that is the percentage of the total circulation in branch a that would have to be reallocated to other subject categories in order to make branch a circulation pattern identical to the total circulation pattern for all branches this translates directly to comparisons involving other variables which might be distributed in the same manner as circulation suppose that the materials acquisition budget were to be allocated to subject categories in proportion to the circulation in each category what would be the difference between making such an allocation for any branch based upon the pattern of total circulation for the entire system as compared with making the allocation based upon the circulation in the individual branch one could use the index of dissimilarity comparing the percentage distribution for the total system circulation across subject categories to the percentage distribution for the branch the value for this index of dissimilarity can then be interpreted as the percentage of the materials acquisition budget using one allocation method that would have to be reallocated to other subject categories to make the distribution identical to the other allocation the index of dissimilarity can be used in two distinct ways to examine the differences in circulation patterns among branch libraries first the percentage distributions of the circulation across subject categories in branch libraries can be compared with the distribution of the total circulation for all of the branch libraries with the corresponding indexes of dissimilarity being computed this approach measures the difference in each branch circulation pattern from the overall pattern it would
 the library quarterly be appropriate for addressing questions regarding the extent to which decisions based upon individual branch circulation patterns would differ from decisions based upon the total circulation pattern for all of the branches the second approach would compare the percentage distributions of circulation in each branch with every other branch with all possible pairs of indexes of dissimilarity being computed this would provide a picture of the maximum differences in circulation patterns between individual branches in the first approach comparing the branch circulation distribution to the total for all branches one is in effect measuring the dissimilarity or variation associated with the distribution for the individual branch as this is being compared to the total or average distribution in the second approach comparing the branch circulation distributions to one another one would be measuring the dissimilarity or variation associated with both of the branches one would expect considerably greater dissimilarity perhaps even twice as much between individual branches when compared with the dissimilarity of the branches to the total branch circulation distribution taking the first approach the indexes of dissimilarity for each branch compared with the distribution of circulation across the subject categories for all branches were calculated and are displayed in table  all of the values for the index of dissimilarity are relatively small ranging from less than  to about  with a mean value across branches of  the largest value of  for the flanner house branch indicates that  percent of its circulation would have to have come in other categories for the circulation pattern to be identical to the overall total at the other extreme for branches like eagle and lawrence only about  percent of the circulation would have to be moved to other categories for their patterns to be identical to the overall total the relatively small values for the indexes of dissimilarity confirm the impressions from the previous analyses and provide more direct measures of the similarities and differences there are some measurable differences between branches in their circulation patterns but these differences are quite modest any judgments based upon those circulation patterns are unlikely to be affected by the small differences between the branches another perspective on the observed differences in circulation patterns can be obtained by considering dissimilarity values in relation to the sizes of the branches the tendency is for smaller branches to have higher values for the index of dissimilarity to be more different from the overall pattern the correlation between the branch circulations and the indexes of dissimilarity is  consider that a number of the branches have annual circulations in the subject categories of

similarities in circulation patterns  branches but some portions of these larger differences were likely due to variations in circulation patterns across subject categories caused by relatively small numbers of patrons with distinctive reading preferences especially in the smaller branches relationships between circulation patterns and service area characteristics while differences in the circulation patterns of the branches from the overall distribution in circulation across subject categories for all of the branches were relatively small it is still useful to examine the source variation in individual branch circulation patterns differences in the overall levels of circulation are strongly related to the social and economic characteristics of the populations being served as indicated by both previous literature and the analyses presented above this section assesses the extent to which the small observed differences in the branch circulation patterns might be associated with such characteristics as opposed to resulting from other perhaps random factors this section first examines the relationship of social and economic characteristics to overall differences in circulation patterns by comparing the circulation patterns of groups of branches with different social and economic characteristics the next part then focuses on the relationship between branch circulation in individual categories and the social and economic characteristics of the service area populations overall differences in circulation patterns the first objective is to determine the extent to which the overall branch circulation patterns differed systematically with the social and economic characteristics of the branch service area populations the index of dissimilarity proved to be useful in comparing individual branch circulation with the overall circulation in this case the index of dissimilarity will be used to measure differences in the patterns between groups of branches with different social and economic characteristics for each of the social and economic variables the branches are placed into three groups based upon the characteristics of their service area populations the bottom third on that variable the middle third and the top third such a division provides for the comparison of groups of branches that fall in the various ranges on each of the variables the grouping of branches allows the comparison of the total group circulation patterns using the index of dissimilarity the grouping also serves to minimize the effects of small branch size and the potential impacts of individual patrons which affects individual branches

similarities in circulation patterns  for all but one of the variables the differences between the bottom and top thirds of the branches were greater than the differences of either of these with the middle third the greatest values for the indexes of dissimilarity all above  came in comparing the bottom and top thirds of the branches based upon the three measures of socioeconomic status education income and occupation the racial and age compositions of the service area populations had even smaller influences in causing differences in circulation patterns as reflected in their indexes of dissimilarity thus the characteristics of the service area populations appear to have some relationship to circulation patterns especially for the education income and occupation variables however the differences are not large showing less dissimilarity than was obtained in comparing individual branch circulation patterns to the total pattern as was done in the previous section differences for individual circulation categories to what extent is the level of circulation in any subject category associated with characteristics of the population in the service area to examine these relationships correlation coefficients were calculated between the percent of the total branch circulation in each of the thirty one subject categories and the five branch service area characteristics this analysis yields a table of  correlation coefficients that would be difficult to interpret and that would include many modest correlations that could have occurred by chance if a significance level of  were selected one would expect to find about eight significant correlations even if there were no relationships between any of the combinations of subject categories and service area characteristics to enable attention to be focused on those relationships that are most likely to be significant both statistically and substantively only those correlation coefficients that are significant at the  level are reported in table  this allows one to more quickly grasp the patterns of significant relationships between circulation by subject category and service area characteristics the service area characteristic most consistently and strongly associated with differences in circulation patterns was the percentage of the population black with twelve of the thirty one correlation coefficients significant at the  level looking down that column branch libraries with high percentages of blacks in their service areas had higher circulation of language and linguistics music mathematics and physics religion social sciences and law government and education these branches had lower circulation in the categories of science fiction literature  natural sciences agriculture geography and travel and history in contrast the measures of socioeconomic status education in

 the library quarterly come and occupation which are so strongly related to levels of circulation show far less of a relationship to the types of circulation the socioeconomic status variables for the branch service areas are significantly correlated at the  level to circulation levels in only four of the thirty one categories with education income and occupation showing generally the same patterns the strongest correlations in the entire table are found between the three measures of socioeconomic status and circulation in the geography and travel category perhaps suggesting that branches with high socioeconomic status service areas circulate more travel books such branches also showed higher circulation of items in the natural sciences history and american history finally the percent of the service area population aged eighteen and over was significantly related to circulation in only two categories geography and travel and history it is important to emphasize the degree to which significant relationships at the  level were not found in this analysis for four of the five service area characteristics percent eighteen and over percent with high school education mean income and percent white collar no significant relationships existed between the characteristics of the service area populations and the percentage of the total branch circulation in at least twenty seven of the thirty one circulation categories branches with very different social characteristics and with very different overall levels of circulation as shown above had patrons reading pretty much the same types of books only the percentage of the service area population that is black was related to patterns of circulation on a somewhat more consistent basis conclusions despite dramatic differences in the characteristics of the service area populations and the levels of overall circulation for the various branches the patterns of circulation across the various categories of adult books are quite similar across the branches traditional statistical analyses indicated small differences among branch circulation patterns the index of dissimilarity showed that only a small percentage of any branch circulation would have to be changed to make the distribution of circulation across categories identical to the overall pattern branches were grouped by demographic characteristics and the differences in the circulation patterns between the groups of branches measured by indexes of dissimilarity were small relationships between population characteristics of the service areas and the percentage of branch circulation in individual categories were examined using correla
similarities in circulation patterns  tion analysis the racial composition of the service areas was significantly related to branch circulation in many categories the other population characteristics were clearly related to circulation levels in only a few circulation categories several points need to be made regarding the limitations to the conclusions that can be drawn from this specific study first and obviously this is a study of differences in circulation patterns across branches in one city indianapolis at one point in time  other settings will not necessarily be the same on the other hand indianapolis is a large and heterogeneous metropolitan area with branches serving very different populations as demonstrated in the analysis so if great differences in circulation patterns were to be found among branches serving different populations one would have expected to find such differences here as mentioned earlier in the discussion of the service areas these data pose a number of problems the data are not current instead coming from the  census the census tracts constituting the service areas will correspond only imperfectly with the areas in which each branch predominates in providing service and in any event branch service areas will overlap to varying degrees a second limitation is that the analysis examines circulation grouped into the subject categories listed in table  the results cannot address the question of whether patrons at different branches are reading the same books or different books within those categories however the original circulation data while not listing individual titles were more highly disaggregated than the circulation data reported here many of the analyses reported in this article were repeated with the original unaggregated circulation data and the results were similar to those reported here the question could be raised as to whether the observed similarities in circulation patterns across the branches might reflect similarities in the collections of those branches patrons will of course be more likely to take out those materials that are available rather than to request materials on interlibrary loan also patrons with different reading interests whose needs are not met by a library branch will tend not to use that branch the selection and acquisition of materials for the library branches in indianapolis was decentralized so there were not similarities in the collections that had been created by a centralized selection system to the extent the individual librarians doing the selection and acquisition in the various branches shared similar batckgrounds and training certain levels of similarity in the collections would be expected and inevitable it must be emphasized that these findings show the similarity in the
 the library quarterly distribution of books circulated in the branch libraries across the set of subject categories employed in the analysis it has not addressed the question as to whether patrons at the different branches are reading different or similar books within those subject categories it is entirely possible for example that library users in black neighborhoods are reading books dealing with black history black literature and black sociology while users in predominantly white neighborhoods are reading more traditional materials questions involving the extent of such differences within the subject categories and the subject categories within which such differences might occur would be important issues to be addressed in further research also any conclusion drawn from the findings of the current study should reflect the potential for such differences given the surprising similarities in the types of adult books circulated by branch libraries serving very different populations attention should be directed at the implications for best serving the needs of those patrons knowledge of branch circulation patterns and their similarities could have important implications for materials selection and materials acquisition budgeting in selecting materials perhaps more attention should be given to understanding those common interests and needs and best selecting materials to meet those needs placing a greater emphasis on centralized selection in a multibranch system might represent a more efficient and effective approach to serving those common needs centralized selectors would have the responsibility for identifying and acquiring multiple copies of materials of general interest to patrons in all branches the librarians in the individual branches would focus more specifically on the meeting of any identified deviations from the general pattern including differences in reading interests within the subject categories such an approach could be implemented through the materials acquisition budgeting process the majority of the materials acquisition funds might be allocated to the centralized selection process for meeting the common needs across branches the remainder of the funds could then be allocated to the branches to be used by the librarians in those branches to acquire other materials to meet the unique needs of patrons of their branches the findings also hinted that at least some of the differences in circulation patterns between branch libraries might be due to the variations in the interests of individual patrons of those branches rather than to systematic variations in the broader interests of the community using the branches to the extent that this might be the case there would be implications for determining the locations of materials to serve these different more specialized needs if certain specialized patron interests are distributed rather more randomly then attempts to identify the
similarities in circulation patterns  branches in which such demand would occur and to enhance collections to meet those needs in specific branches could fail it might be more effective to develop collections to serve such specialized interests in a centralized location or locations patrons with those interests could then either travel to that location or obtain the materials by delivery to their local branches as the preceding discussions of the possible implications of these findings should make clear our presenting findings of significant levels of similarity in circulation patterns across branches is certainly not intended to suggest that the specific and unique needs of individual patrons and communities should be ignored increasing emphasis has been placed on the importance of identifying community needs for library services and developing services to respond to those needs as exemplified by the manual planning and role settingfor public libraries charles mcclure and others  if library patrons from diverse backgrounds show considerable similarities in their reading interests however it is important that those common interests also be understood and addressed in library planning and decision making perhaps the most general conclusion would be that people who read and borrow books from public libraries seem to share a broad common set of interests while the populations served by library branches vary and while this variation can have a tremendous influence on the levels of reading and circulation those adults who read select as a group pretty much the same types of books whatever the characteristics of the neighborhoods from which they come references  zweizig douglas and dervin brenda public library use users uses advances in knowledge of the characteristics and needs of the adult clientele of american public libraries in advances in librarianship vol  edited by melvin j voigt and michael h harris new york academic press   kronus carol l patterns of adult library use a regressional and path analysis adult education      zweizig douglas predicting amount of library use an empirical study of the role of the public library in the life of the adult public phd diss syracuse university   gallup organization inc book reading and library usage a study of habits and perceptions princeton nj gallup organization   hayes robert m and palmer e susan the effects of distance upon use of libraries case studies based on a survey of users of the los angeles public library central library and branches library research      lange janet m public library users nonusers and type of library use public library quarterly
