from our readers    is academic freedom dead at ucla graduate school of library and information science eleven ucla faculty members signed a letter jelis fall  p  that attacks on ideological grounds alone a well researched and statistically sound article by donald case and john richardson jelis winter  it is remarkable that the signers of the letter are members of a profession that champions freedom of speech and opposes any restriction on dissemination of controversial opinions it is also remarkable that they engage in public name calling racist to protest what they imagine is ideological impurity in the article they evidently lacked substantive criticism over thirty years ago suspected communists were harassed and hounded in similar ways and with as little cause cecilia wittmann drury college springfield missouri having just read the views of case and richardson colleagues at ucla jelis fall  we feel compelled to add our comments if a research report in a scholarly journal devoted to education for our profession cannot be evaluated in an objective emotion free manner then our profession and its professors are indeed in trouble we found nothing in the article to suggest that the authors held racist attitudes in fact case and richardson explicitly stated that making decisions on the basis of gender and foreign background runs counter to some of our stated professional goals the attempt by a majority of ucla faculty to distance themselves from the article and apparently from its authors implies that the accusation of racism is justified and does substantial discredit not to the authors of the article but to the signers of the letter to the editor while it is certainly true that the faculty members at ucla have every right to express their opinion on their colleagues work it seems very strange that this should be done without pointing out the offending statements so that readers could form an objective opinion exploring demographic variables such as gender and race issues requires tact and sensitivity but surely such study is not inherently prejudicial some of the signers of the letter have probably conducted such demographic studies it is difficult to understand how groups that need special attention and funding for retention in academic programs can be identified if studying factors such as dropout rates is not permissible some of the perception of bias in case and richardson article may be the product of methodological problems although the authors do not explicitly state the test used in comparing means it appears to be a t test for independent samples if this is so then the wrong statistic has been reported in the article and statements regarding significance are very suspect the f statistic which is reported throughout the article is properly an indicator of spring  
journal of education for library and information science which calculation of the t statistic should be used in analysis if the f statistic is significant meaning that the independent samples are from populations with dissimilar variance the separate variance t statistic is used otherwise the pooled variance t statistic is used t values have not been reported in the article there is the appearance of the f statistic and its significance level having been used mistakenly as an indicator of differences in means some of the differences in means such as  versus  years of work experience or a  undergraduate gpa versus  just do not logically seem substantial enough to be significant at the same time a mean difference of  points on the gre analytical score seems somewhat likely to be significant it is unfortunate that the referee system for the journal failed to catch these problems a simple note to the authors would have allowed them to correct their analysis and saved them from embarrassment since we are sure many of the signers of the letter are regular users of statistical tests the fact that they did not notice or at least did not comment on what appears to be a substantial methodological error argues that their comments may have been made without a thorough reading of the paper itself damning without presenting evidence is not in the highest academic tradition damning without reading is inexcusable in short although case and richardson may have made a simple and understandable error in statistical analysis to accuse them of rac ism why were they not also accused of sexism and xenophobia is excessive and unjustified the disclaimer issued by case and richardson coworkers is an unfortunate commentary on collegiality at that institution an abridgment of case and richardson intellectual freedom and an embarrassment to library and information science education connie n fleet danny p wallace and bert r royce school of library and information science louisiana state university  volume  number
