the librarian and adult education emerson greenaway sitting in my office one winter afternoon i began to peruse the pile of afternoon mail letters memorandums bills to be authorized and finally at the bottom of the heap a copy of the london times literary supplement on turning it over i glanced casually at the last page where books are reviewed in brief and caught this little sentence i can be known only by my notes and i am quite satisfied if  years hence it shall be said that one porson lived towards the close of the eighteenth century who did a good deal for the text of euripides there were a few short asides scantily informing me that this one porson was in fact richard porson born in  and appointed professor of greek at cambridge university at the age of thirty three the rest of the afternoon was spent in pursuing more pressing matters but i could not quite get this unfamiliar scholar out of my mind few indeed are the men who aspire to immortality through their footnotes and to settle the business i decided to sleuth this one porson down it wasn long before i found him cast adrift among all the other p in the dictionary of national biography from some ten pages of closely crowded type he emerged tall roman nosed keen eyed the perfect portrait of the english scholar like many another man who has aspired to greatness porson had been born in poor but honest surroundings the grandson of a shoemaker he was intended for the weaving trade but he showed such aptitude at the village school that he was sent to study with a neighboring clergyman scholarships provided him an education at both eton and trinity and for a while he contemplated the ministry i found he wrote that i should require about fifty years reading to make myself thoroughly acquainted with divinity to satisfy my mind on all points considering the limited life span in the eighteenth century porson decision not to take orders was undoubtedly a wise one illequipped for business and ignorant of a trade he was fortunate in learning of an open professorship in greek at his alma mater trinity and at thirty three he found himself a professor he continued to reside in the temple where he could devote himself to textual criticism and shunt off the burden of student lectures when someone inquired why he did not lecture he said because i have thought better on it whatever originality my lectures might have had people would have cried out e knew all this before in  he was made principal librarian at the newly formed london institution and benefited from the princely annual stipend of  and a set of rooms in what i suspect to be a classic understatement of the case the dictionary of national biography notes that the managers afterwards complained    that his attendance was irregular and that he did nothing to enlarge the library but in one respect at least he made a good librarian he was always ready to give information to the numer
 ehe library quarterly ous callers at his rooms in the institution who came to consult him in matters of ancient or modern literature in the words of a contemporary he told you all you wanted to know in a plain and direct manner without any attempt to display his own superiority but merely to inform you with such testimony to his professional good manners i think his sporadic attendance at the reading room desk might be forgiven him in between callers he busied himself with the emendation and examination of the euripidean drama hecuba medea orestes were the companions of his days fellowships which do not wither or grow old books were the pattern of his life and he was conversant with the literature not only of the ancients but of his contemporaries as well while other men sought the gaiety and wit of the coffee house he remained a solitary figure on the london scene long sleepless nights led him to habits of intemperance and these no doubt strained a rather frail existence before he was even fifty years old richard porson died overshadowed in life by the great author whose works he had studied he was eclipsed also in death for his grave in trinity college chapel lies at the foot of newton statue and so i had done the volume of the dictzionary of national biography was ultimately replaced with its fellows on the shelf my curiosity had been satisfied and perhaps i should have forgotten him but somehow all through the preparation of this paper this spectral scholar has remained in my mind whenever librarians get together to talk about the great bookmen they think in terms of someone like one porson how leisurely his days no traffic with burdensome budgets no concerns with municipal problems no building program to worry over which one of us does not turn nostalgically to those intimate discussions in his library rooms where he told you all you wanted to know in such a singularly modest way yet beyond those tutorial sessions which he moderated great things were happening in the world newton had opened up new dimensions of earth and air and sky john locke was insisting upon the rights of rational men a small struggling country across the sea was proclaiming its independence on the continent a king and queen were sentenced to the guillotine and we might question the limited periphery of that small set of rooms in the london institution richard porson used an ancient method of teaching to the questioners who sought him out he gave answers directly and informally who were these questioners they were the initiated like himself the scholar the teacher the student in hoping that history would render him the verdict of immortality for his textual criticism of greek literature porson could not foresee the dramatic changes of history parliamentary government the emergence of democratic states the rise of a vocal voting constituency the shift from rural to urban civilization the great changes stimulated by the industrial revolution all conspired to create a new class of questioners the non initiated working and middle classes it was for them that the novel was written those long leisurely accounts with soap opera plots dealing with the indeterminable perils of innumerable clarissas and pamelas the newspaper product of the eighteenth century provided the first step in what we now call mass communication technological and social advances
the librarian and adult education  precipitated a need for vocational training and a desire for self betterment the nineteenth century responded with mercantile libraries lyceums classes for working men the aims of this new education were varied it was education for citizenship education for aesthetic and cultural appreciation education for more gainful employment what nineteenth century adult education tried to do sometimes successfully and sometimes not was to teach large numbers of people who did not have the advantage of formal schooling it was simply a voluntary program of study undertaken in maturity the library as a repository of great ideas and informed opinions fitted into this framework by offering its resources at convenient hours no longer for a subscription fee to adults of whom it required only literacy as a stipulation of use the people university was an appropriate coinage implying that education was a possibility for every man who desired it the remedies of the nineteenth century were soon found wanting in relationship to the educational needs of the twentieth century the ambitious youth intent on a better tomorrow who borrowed his books from a mercantile library in  is today paralleled in the public library by a college student a businessman or a skilled workman whose take home pay in all probability exceeds the wage of the librarian who serves him in any case this young man formal education is at least at a high school level and the network of informational circuits including television radio newspapers magazines and movies provides him a broader educational base than that of his nineteenth century equivalent his problem is not that of finding a single outlet for his educational drive but rather that of discovering from the welter of informal courses great books programs discussion series and lectures just which one is suitable to his needs within the span of a hundred years from about  to  the picture of adult education has drastically changed from a ulniqueness of opportunity to a multiplicity of opportunities in the process adult education has been subject to censure and to praise like most things in life it is here to stay and we must decide only what are the best ways to deal with it if for convenience we can note the definition of adult education as a voluntary program of study undertaken in maturity then the activity can range from the reading of ten books on atomic energy to evening attendance at a major university or the watching of a session of sunrise semester on television most educators believe in these activities some might be suspicious of the results but very few would consider them intrinsically harmful two problems confront us again and again as we plan for adult education the first and we may dismiss this problem somewhat quickly is one of definition a variety of extraneous subjects are now covered by adult education cake decorating wine cookery or upholstering may each in turn expand the waistline satisfy the palate or stretch the pocketbook but they do not seem the meat and matter of serious study and contemplation the expansion of the mind is the responsibility of the educator and he rightfully resents the popular confusion of learning with unessential avocations i said we might dismiss this quickly because it seems to me that librarians understand this distinction for the most part and that their use of
 the library quarterly the phrase adult education involves a large degree of what agatha christie m poirot calls so delightfully the little grey cells the second problem is far more complex and involves the distinction between the individual and the group formalized adult educational programs whether conducted by libraries or by other agencies are largely group activities there is an obvious practical reason for this the education of adults is the education of a very large percentage of the population and unlike fourth graders or sophomores adults are not bound together in neatly identifiable age gradations adults are youngmarrieds in their twenties grandparents in their late fifties retired people in their seventies the difficulty of adult education is that it is mass education and the educator confronted with numerous peoplesome as for instance in the television class without even the identity of name or face has a tremendous problem to many librarians engaged in adult educational activity large numbers of people some assembled for a lecture others grouped for a discussion still others seated in their living room watching a library television show present not only a problem but a dilemma historically traditionally the teacher has always worked with both children and adults in groups in our day the specific difficulty to the teacher is not the group but rather the density and diversity of the group the ever increasing numbers of individuals who comprise it the librarian however belongs to a tradition of work with individuals it is a natural tradition for book reading is primarily a personal experience and one whose pleasures are not commonly shared on the adult level at one given time or in one place this is the reason perhaps why the tribute to porson librarianship is so appealing but in one respect at least he made a good librarian he was always ready to give information to the numerous callers    who came to consult him in matters of ancient or modern literature it is this factor of personal service this knowledge both intuitive and professed of irndividual needs and the ways to serve them that has been the mark and testament of good librarianship however the fulfilment of the educational needs of the eighteenth century bears little resemblance to the educational pattern of a democratic society two hundred years ago it was the affluent the socially acceptable the professional class who could afford or were provided the advantage of education to these were added the exceptional cases the brilliant or gifted who stood out from their fellows to such a degree that scholarships were recommended or granted for their particular needs the extension of a mass educational program brings in its wake its own problems and sometimes we tend to forget its own rewards to meet the challenge of democratic education the library has been compelled to carry on its own educational objectives through service to groups as well as service to individuals and this has been the basis for much criticism many fear that the individual book lover becomes merely a face in the crowd who passes through the public library only to register another number on a turnstile or to add a few digits to the daily circulation count such critics of group activities point out that the librarian freed from the routines of hand charging now leaves the service desk to chair a discussion
the librarian and adult education  group or participate in a committee meeting the technological progress made in libraries it would seem has led us to dehumanize our service and neglect our first responsibility the reader these critics find their support not only in the tradition of libraries with their concept of service to the individual but also in a large body of literature devoted to the critique of the group process as a stagnant and stultifying experience the literary pretensions of main street thanatopsis club have been rendered graphically in new yorker cartoons showing very plump much bonneted ladies engaged in a committee meeting such groups whether they meet in libraries or without gather to discuss politics and poets with the same purposeful expression and the result say the critics is a brew of good intentions few facts sporadic effects and of course we must not forget hot tea and little sandwiches basically what librarians fear in the group process is a common denominator a conformity of opinion and expression which unifies people rather than individualizing them we often hear the expression watering down and we mentally envision the great body of learning like a good thick soup being thinned and then thinned again until it feeds fifty where it should have fed five the question we must ask is very simply is this criticism justified the persistent issue in adult educational activities in libraries has been the degree to which the library assumes the educational burden first should we serve only those who register to use our resources second should we co operate in the educational process as a kind of silent partner by lending our assistance to established classes or groups in the community and third should we take a positive role in the educational enterprise and perhaps launch the library into a full fledged teaching career we are all in agreement that service should be extended to that first class of library users the readers themselves in the second category most libraries give at least tacit encouragement to any number of formal or informal educational agencies in their communities it is the third premise that the library should assume an educational role per se which provokes most of the controversy the library is not a school librarians are not teachers and so the hue and cry begins admittedly the library is not a school and the librarian is not a teacher but the schoolroom and the teacher are concomitants of formal education and adult education as it is daily practiced in scores of libraries is basically informal education in this respect the fact that the librarian is not a teacher has little or no bearing on the case what is more to the point is whether or not the library fully lives up to its requirements as an educational institution education is defined as the imparting and the acquisition of knowledge historically libraries have been and still are the main repositories of accumulated knowledge in the world that the cultural status of a community or the academic standing of a university can be in part assessed by the extent and quality of its library holdings indicates to what extent the library is indispensable to the acquisition of knowledge but imparting involves a transplanting of knowledge a bestowal it involves specifically a recipient and a giver and there may be the crux of the matter if the library provides the answers to questions such as how many
 the library quarterly children did lincoln have where is shakespeare buried what is the length of the brooklyn bridge then the library is not imparting knowledge it is transferring information and interpreting the resources of the printed word to satisfy what in many cases is an isolated request even the more intensive reference function of the library one which involves considerable skill on the part of the librarian stops short of fulfilling the library responsibilities as an educational institution many patrons concentrating on a particular problem may use the library intensively for a short period of time and in this sense the library contributes to their education but does not educate them whom should a public library in a democratic society educate in carl sandburg phrase there is only one answer the people yes five hundred years ago through the words of a morality play the people heard knowledge solemnly promise i will go with thee and be thy guide and that promise was made to everyman such inscriptions were once to be found carved above the doors of many a public library for librarians were not then so easily embarrassed about matters of the spirit and the heart they believed as christopher morley so gently states it that there were three ingredients in the good life learning earning and yearning a man should be learning as he goes and he should be earning bread for himself and others and he should be yearning too yearning to know the unknowable and librarians then confidently offered their wares for the solution of all three i am not here tonight to advise a return to the good old days nor do i think it necessary to proclaim our function to the world through carvings in marble or stone but surely our progress in bibliographic techniques has not made us lose the vitality and energy which first made library service in this country a reality instead of a dream the very name public library was somewhat awe inspiring a library for the people and few believed that the people only referred to a hard core of readers there was many an anonymous everyman who never used his library and yet supported it financially and he was also the library responsibility this philosophy of claiming all men for our province motivated many of our most rewarding extensions of service library service to the handicapped and hospitalized service to rural and outlying areas by bookmobile and the establishment of small book collections in everything from fire stations to housing projects adult education was but a furtherance of this philosophy to parody the old nursery rhyme everywhere the people went the librarian was sure to go in our day this means that the librarian engages in educational activities designed for group participation because group activities are the prevailing mode of contemporary education to spend valued time regretting the loss of personalized service to readers is very like regretting the absence of candlelight or the horse drawn carriage when the die was cast to undertake the schooling of every child born in this country the concept of education based upon norms or averages had to be realized only the exceptional child exceptional because his mentality is above the norm or below it continues to receive personalized individualized training because of universal primary and secondary education many more adults to christopher morley parnassits on wheels garden city ny doubleday page  co  p 
the librarian and adult education t day than a hundred years ago desire higher education or informal education at the adult level all of us know the great problems confronting colleges and universities with their ever increasing student enrolment the question before the minds of all teachers and professors in this country is how can we cope with the mass twenty five years ago at the first graduate library school conference this proposition was made the library is part of society as a whole and does not exist in any sense in a vacuum nor does it pursue its own course isolated from the happenings around it the corollary of this assumption is that libraries are on the other hand largely molded by the events that are occurring outside their walls in society as a whole if this proposition is valid and i believe it is then why do we think that the library can escape this perplexing national educational issue whether it is education for children for young people or for adults we are faced with a problem of numbers each year our children librarians visit more classes in more schools our reading rooms are filled with more students asking for help with school assignments and term papers our adult librarians spread themselves thin by preparing book talks participating in discussion groups introducing programs of library films today we are forced to deal with masses wanting our services the individual is becoming increasingly difficult to identify that everyman might know is the belief on which the public school and the public library are founded are the results of the belief our tragedy or triumph does our success paradoxically contain the seeds of our failure many believe that the education picture is a tragic one they view the increased attendance at museums musical academies libraries and schools with a sense of dread america they believe is producing a mass culture in which each person knows a little but no man knows much to make knowledge palatable culture activities are rendered effortless and the result is a race of enthusiasts who do not understand the nature of their enthusiasms others hold that the picture is not at all so grim that everyman might know a little is surely an improvement over the days when most men could not read or write if it must be agreed that we have not arrived at an educational utopia we must be at least grateful that the country no longer faces the illiterate barbarism of the frontier between the two extremes lies the answer and for the librarian the perspective necessary for his educational role democracy survives in a climate of egalitarianism but nature produces man with many differentials all men are free to learn in a democratic society but only some men can profit by it since the library is part of this democratic society anyone may use its resources and services but only some men will if we are to accept the full challenge of education in this society then we must be aware that as each new generation is born more people will have reason or desire to learn than before and it is this new growth which we must encourage how this is done is a matter for each library to decide but it will not be done by the librarian patiently waiting in the reading room for numerous callers to seek him out i may sometimes envy the richard porsons of the past but their answers are not mine the mark of good illiam f ogburn recent social trends their implications for libraries in library trends papers presented before the library institute of the university of chicago august    ed louis r wilson chicago university of chicago press  p 
 the library quarterly librarianship in our day will not be merely our readiness to give information to those who consult us but rather our readiness to give information to those who do not our libraries must not be mere stopping places to quench thirst they must actively take their part in making men thirsty this can be accomplished only by thinking of the librarian as educator and in many cases this involves a redefinition of the librarian traditional duties and his traditional training the role of the librarian as an anonymous public servant is gradually disappearing giving way to a new image of the librarian as a civic and cultural leader for years librarians gave book talks and made a very careful distinction between a book talk and a lecture lectures on moden art musicology or classical antiquities could only be given by professors artists archeologists or musicians the librarian could only talk about books in these fields the line between delivering a well researched lecture on matisse and giving a talk about the biographies and critical studies of matisse can sometimes become so fine that it well nigh disappears after twenty years of critical selection reviewing and reading of books in the art field the art librarian may be assumed to know something about art if he does his is a serious responsibility to communicate this knowledge to others to do his part toward extending the cultural boundary line he may be called upon to lecture to a graduate seminar of future art historians he may be invited to judge a show of paintings by local artists he may add his remarks to an art film during a community program this is the librarian as educator some of his efforts will be wasted others will fall on fertile ground when the relationship of pupil and master is intimate and personal the measurement of the pupil progress is relatively simple and if there has been progress the master rewards are great but the librarian as educator does not easily perceive the results of his labor this happens perhaps because of a basic error in our thinking we expect a qualitative role to be assessed in quantitative terms for instance if the book talk was not followed by fifteen requests for the book the librarian felt a sense of failure because the emphasis was placed on his resources and materials not on his mind or ideas in the education of many people we will never know whether or not they will ever read or use a library but we must accept and indeed be grateful that in one given place and at one given time a little part of humanity can sit quietly in a meeting room permeated by great ideas or stimulating conversation for some breathing an idea charged air is very intoxicating and they will come back for more for others less venturesome in spirit the air is rarefied and pure like on a mountain top and they find it downright uncomfortable for the latter group the important thing is that at least they have been exposed to a new atmosphere and a hundred years ago that exposure was neither probable nor possible who has seen the wind asks christina rossetti and of course no one has but it is there all the same mass education is very much like the wind no one eye can see it but it is there all the same and i shall venture a prophecy that in the years to come as america is engaged in the basic question of survival or annihilation this wind must and will increase in such force that like a gale it carries out to sea the refuse of ignorance and prejudice
