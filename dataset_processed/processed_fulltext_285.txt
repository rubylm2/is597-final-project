the alexander turnbull library of wellington new zealand clyde r h taylor t  nhe writer of this account is of the staff of this library and recently traveled through the united states studying the more specialized libraries of the country when the turnbull library was told of librarians frequently expressed the wish that some information as to the resources of the institution should be placed before scholars and librarians of america and europe in order that research workers there may know where lie the primary study sources of oceania i think i am correct in saying that in its main field the turnbull library is unexcelled and taken as a whole its resources are such as to make both book collector and librarian alike wonder that in such a far distant corner of the globe one man could gather such treasures of both the world about him and the older world whence his forebears had come alexander horsburgh turnbull was born at wellington the capital of new zealand in i and was educated at dulwich college england his father was a wealthy merchant of new zealand and after completing his studies alexander entered the london office of the business where he stayed till i during this period he discovered the love of books that remained all his life with undiminished ardor returning to new zealand he took control of the business and at the same time organized the channels through which he bought books for the next quarter century till his death in i it was thus from this distant outpost that the great collection was built up which is now the pride of the people of new zealand to whom it was bequeathed upon its founder death it was opened to the public in i under the control of mr johannes carl andersen assisted by a small staff as libraries are reckoned now it is a small collection numberi
the alexander turnbull library i ing about seventy thousand volumes of which some sixty thou sand were gathered by mr turnbull these can be grouped into three broad classes pacific and new zealand literature rare books and english classical literature in the first group the scope was made to include ethnology anthropology pacific languages folk lore and voyages apart from the general subjects that would be expected in such a class the rare books include a few incunabula mainly choice items and a great number of the choicest first editions of the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries in english literature with special reference to drama and poetry there is also representation of the finest printing from the fifteenth century to the present day crowned by a complete set of the kelmscott press the english literature material supplements much that is in the rare book section and is especially strong in the same fields poetry and drama the pacific portion embraces the islands of that ocean as well as australia and new zealand it should be said here that the library of the bernice p bishop museum of honolulu specializes in the former region too just as the mitchell library of sydney devotes itself to australian records the turnbull library covers both though somewhat less extensively of pacific languages there are some five thousand volumes in practically every tongue and dialect of these many islands voyaging both pacific and otherwise has had special attention hakluyt and de bry this set from the huth library head the list followed by linschoten purchas cook vancouver burney pinkerton the hakluyt society dalrymple tasman and others this is supplemented by some fine manuscript material logs of cook and vancouver a larger group of cook journals is in the mitchell library of alvaro de mendaina discovery of the solomon islands in i  gallego manuscript which has been translated in the hakluyt society volume of ioi the journal of antoneli survey of the coast of south america in o used in hakluyt society volume xxiii io also many logs of whalers and early traders as well as the manuscript journal of new zealand first missionary rev samuel marsden kept during his visit there in ii the sec
 the library quarterly tion is supplemented with a fine collection of antarctic exploration the fields of australasian literature poetry and prose are very full up to recent years when economy became necessary flora and fauna have received equal attention as have sport and art i fear most librarians think with this illogical association in the way of art the library contains splendid works by early new zealand artists such as heaphy the new zealand company draftsman whose new zealand scenes are very valuable historically barraud two hundred water colors hodgkins the founder of the dunedin art society fifty items sir william fox kettle kinder swainson the zological writer and others of lesser note there are some hundreds of modern australian etchings including some fine ones by meryon and in addition many hundreds of historic prints referring to the region the gem of this portion of the library is a series of over six hundred etchings by some of the greatest masters of europe including some fifty by rembrandt as well as others by diurer van dyck rubens merian etc this collection was presented by bishop monrad prime minister of denmark who once lived in new zealand there was once a great collection of maori new zealand native antiques and works of art but in i mr turnbull transferred these to the dominion museum of new zealand where they supplement the splendid specimens there the maori had a fine culture and his race was probably one of the intellectually highest of all aboriginal races while his tools were of nothing better than the beautiful pounamou greenstone his achievement with them and the other materials at his hand was little short of marvelous his religion mythology and tradition were all on a high plane and extremely well developed i interpolate this brief allusion to explain mr turnbull interest in the maori and the associated races of polynesia which bore fruit in a fine set of books on all phases of the subject for the scholar who would work among the great of the old
the alexander turnbull library i world there are many books of prime importance supported by a small proportion of manuscript material the first group here is a collection of miltoniana which is reputed to be equal to any outside the british museum and contains first editions of practically everything including the comus lycidas and five title pages of paradise lost there is an interesting manuscript of walter begley the translator of the novae solymae as well as a group of books from his collection other special collections are devoted to defoe swinburne and browning both robert and elizabeth b these are all rich in first editions many with autograph associations and in the case of browning are made more significant by reason of manuscript material browning had a friend in new zealand alfred domett one of the celebrated poets of the country his best known work is ranoif and amohia browning copy of which is in the library and much of the correspondence between the two is here another antipodean correspondent of browning was r hengist horne and many of his letters find their place here too other valuable manuscripts are in the carlyle material these include many by carlyle himself miss jewsbury and mrs jane welch carlyle this collection came from the library of gideon mantell the english geologist who was a friend of carlyle and of miss jewsbury and whose son later went to new zealand becoming a minister of the crown in the government of the day among the general manuscripts there are letters from the following professor silliman of yale lyell the geologist over two hundred in each case percy b shelley charles dickens bulwer lytton napoleon conrad bentley the nephew of the great scholar robert buchanan oscar wilde and a host of others apart from many of importance in oceania most librarians feel a pride in the possession of some of the great monuments among books and i cannot refrain from mentioning a few among the greatest of these of the great printers there are examples by peter schoeffer constitutions of clement on vellum ii erhardt ratdolt euclid geometry of

the alexander turnbull library i done if i do not mention the librarian who has cared for these treasures for the past fifteen years this is johannes carl andersen one of new zealand most eminent scholars yet himself not by birth of that country he is a dane who came to new zealand in the eighties as a child he is largely self educated and has taken pleasure in many studies of which perhaps poetry and maori folk lore are his favorites he has written much in these and other fields and opportunity has enabled him to use material that often was fast being lost here are some of his published works which show his many sided activities songs unsung the lamp of psyche maori life in aotea maori tales bird songs and new zealand song birds maori stringfigures laws of verse and myths and legends of the polynesians mr andersen is an editor of the ournal of the polynesian society and a fellow of the new zealand branch of the royal society his interests are many and his imprint upon the culture of our country inestimable and such as will be enduring so for the northern world and to some extent for the southern too i have given a suggestion so that the student in the fields where the turnbull library is rich may know where to turn for the page that will enlighten him kia ora
