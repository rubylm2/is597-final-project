i have two legs not four navigating the isms of the lis minefield  gender andor cultural heritage and experience reflectively we are not navel gazers librarian scholars and practitioners often balk at taking an inquiry based stance on the interweaving of our personal beliefs and views with our professional practices in essence we librarians are a bunch of emotional punks i a black woman who is an lis faculty member within an indigenous context am complicit in the paradigm of lis punk ification at alise  i shared the vignette that opened this article and the questions that emerged during my presentation were the same questions that i asked myself back then when the horrid doris experience occurred why didnt i git wit doris why didnt i tell her whats good why didnt i let doris know that what she said was hateful and file a complaint to the principal for her vile statement why didnt i tell doris thank you for the education on how you really see meas her boss as her colleague as a fellow catholic as a fellow woman as a fellow human being i resigned from that position within a year of my start date there were a few oppressive things happening at that workplace and my ancestors had been slaves long enough to nudge me that i needed to leave that job nevertheless those questions why didnt i git wit doris why didnt i tell her whats good are still a part of my personal soundtrack for various microaggressions and transgressions that i experience as a librarian within a white maleprivileged western culture that has made it clear that its culture and systemic infrastructure hatesabhors is that softer nicerhuman beings who are not male who are not descended from western european people and who are not of a heritage that ensures public and private privileges that are gendered and enculturedemotional and p sychological and historic for example can i share that my personal soundtrack why didnt i git wit so and so why didnt i tell them whats good is played every time i go on campus even where i work and teach now what stories can i tell that will fully convey the subtle yet injurious ways in which white men disregard disrespect and disempower as in silencing voiced ness and erasing relevancy women of color particularly on a daily basis there are many experiences past and present that form an interwoven tapestry of toggling between voiced ness and self advocacy and erasure from self imposed censorship of emotional intellectual and ethical response to the ways in which i read behavior directed toward me based on how colleagues and students read who i am to them even within the supposed freedom to tell my story via the platform of this international peer reviewed journal i still feel that i am at risk of repercussion for voicing myself as a means of self advocacy the rage of injustice that i constantly experience must be contained to be understood my indignation must be presented and conveyed in a dignified manner because its about being professional and well regarded in my profession not about being respected as a human being because when people of color express that something is not right its a historical typicality that our advocacy quickly gets misinterpreted
 irvin to somethings always wrong and this might be true because something always is wrong when subtle and overt forms of sexism racism and classism silence erase and punt peoples experience to the other end of the proverbial field of lets not deal with thislets discard this trouble i cannot count the many times ive tried to share my experiences of sexism and racism only to be told no thats not it or well thats just how you see it or the worst always said in jest here comes trouble in lis we have a serious dissonance toward how we are toward one another i feel like we librarians dont respect the details of one anothers presence as people who happen to be information professionals and scholars in the world we dont apply our own professional values and practices toward one another we dont treat one another as patronsas whole persons who have funds of knowledge and we dont take a reflective approach to our own professional epistemology to be our own best librarian we are supposed to be information professionals yet the thoughtless ways in which we disregard one another run counter to our professions values of empathy mindfulness and respect for peoples knowledge and information and as we know the information gods live in the details in library school we teach pre service librarians that were supposed not only to pay attention but also to kindly and empathetically regard the details of human interaction watch body language and vocal tone when working with patrons during reference interviews learn the intricacies of citation styles aacr rules and the importance of reading books news instructions applications signs etc in order to successfully help library users to use the library and other institutions in the world and to navigate their own lives we teach librarians the importance of reading understanding categorizing and preserving the bibliographic data of a book a film or any other library or archive artifact because every single detail of that artifact certifies that that item exists we teach that it is ethical for librarians to stand up and advocate for people in the world who are marginalized at risk and underserved yet we have those same people as members of our profession whom we disrespect because they are from marginalized communities or at risk or underserved backgrounds case in point ive had many experiences where i have had to ask myself some jacked up reflective questions would that student say that to the lis professor who is a white cis male would that ala staff person reveal the financial membership profile of a white librarian male or female to their colleagues would those lis colleague scholars steal authorship of an article written by a fellow white woman or man instead of me could i get away with ten year old syllabi and assignments or outdated lectures if i were not a black woman would students submit on par assignments to me while being able to call me by my first name instead of dr irvin or professor irvin
i have two legs not four navigating the isms of the lis minefield  the answers are all no ive had male students tell me that i didnt know what i was talking about during a lecture ive had students interrupt my lecture to make a personal secretarial request for me to email them the lecture instead of listening to what i have to say ive experienced an ala staff person emailing me about my unpaid dues and copying a full handful of people on the email im no longer a member of ala for this reason ive seen other lis faculty who are of the majority privileged demographic who have received course evaluations below  and have full tenure while ive been called on the carpet for scoring a few points below  for one class for one semester over the course of consistent  evaluations over a span of years ive seen mainstream lis faculty colleagues teach the same lectures for years and not update them ive seen lis faculty email to lis students that have said things that i would never say such as you are a poor student your work is horrible you cannot turn that in lateno ive seen lis faculty email to students in all caps and exclamation points to boot i would never but more pointedly i could never ive been brought up on university charges for telling a student with supervisor approval that they should withdraw from my course with a w grade instead of failing students have filed complaints against me for not awarding extra credit to them because they didnt follow the extra credit instructions ive been accused of saying things in office hours that i did not say so now i always have a witness in my office or my office door open whenever i meet with or talk with students admittedly ive felt the need to secretly audio record office hours with a rare few students with whom i had challenging interactions for just in case ive been told that im disrespectful to local culture because i insist that student librarians follow instructions and be precise in the formatting of their assignments as preparation for writing annual reports as library administrators grant documents often federal for library funding and peer reviewed manuscripts that must meet a certain level of excellence across the world why didnt i git wit so and so why didnt i tell them whats good because even though i walk on two legs people who have privilege within the majority culture and those who carry multiple isms to which i qualify still think if not act like i walk on fours heres the thing i know who i amand i am not responsible for explaining my existence or the validity thereof to anyone    right in recent years there has been a healthy amount of lis research published that talks about librarian identity eg pagowsky  perini  and explores critical theory issues of power and equity and social justice in librarianship cooke  leckie given  buschman  in an effort to bring attention and it is hoped some conversation and reflection around our collective dissonance as colleagues can we read articles and research to read one another better to read one another
 irvin more softly to regard one another in a kindlier way can lis professionals who are of the majority mainstream american culture swallow the hard pill of yall not as nice and kind as you think and gently enter an ongoing reflective inquiry stance toward their own personal professional identity constructions without appropriating cultures beyond their own indigeneity without colonizing black and brown conversations and spaces can white lis professionals figure out on their own when to speak and say when to be quiet and respect the room when to show up and when to stay put and most of all even if you tell us that we have space to speak and that we have privilege to say that we will not believe you is it possible for white lis professionals western based to humbly understand or at least empathize and then act on that empathy with kindness and mindfulness toward their colleagues of color and other bordered identities overall  makes a good case for how lis is structured based on the understanding that culture and knowledge are separate where knowledge is constructed based on ways of knowing that stem from enacting specific practices training and development of skills however a more realistic view of how knowledge is constructed comes from the understanding that culture and knowledge are inseparable working hand in hand because knowledge is constructed as an outcome of social interaction when culture is understood as a holistic expression of knowledge and values a broader understanding of literacy can emerge for lis this means that lis would embrace a broader idea of what counts as knowledge and what makes a person literate overall  p  says that a broader view of what information is includes diverse forms of information such as pictures drawings music dance media text symbols signs and aural tradition which convey meaning to humans this perspective allows for cultural differences about information and how it is developed and used here is overalls definition for cultural competency in lis cultural competence is the ability to recognize the significance of culture in ones own life and in the lives of others and to come to know and respect diverse cultural backgrounds and characteristics through interaction with individuals from diverse linguistic c ultural and socioeconomic groups and to fully integrate the culture of diverse groups into services work and institutions in order to enhance the lives of both those being served by the library profession and those engaged in service  pp  as mentioned overall  calls for three domains where cultural competency develops  cognitive cultural self awareness and knowledge are developed  interpersonal cultural appreciation and ethic of caring are developed and  environmental language conditions space and policies are developed cultural self awareness includes building cultural knowledge formally and informallythrough shared
