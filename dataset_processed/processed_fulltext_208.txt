 journal of education for library and information science on this definition of indraratne equity of lis education within the context of this paper is defined as equalization of lis educational opportunities to all interested individuals irrespective of class caste creed ethnicity and location equity of education in the developing countries of asia has been studied by lee using four criteria namely gender income region and sociocultural he asserts that these are the criteria set out by the framework and criteria for the appraisal and socioeconomic justification of education projects to study the equity of education in the developing countries of asia a search for literature pertaining to equity of lis education in sri lanka was made but it was established that nothing has been written the only analytical studies of lis education in sri lanka were those of irving and wijetunge and willson but neither dealt with the equity of lis education programs the literature search was expanded to the other south asian countries and it was confirmed that in the south asian region lis education is offered only in bangladesh india and pakistan other than sri lanka although many other aspects of lis education are well represented in the literature equity of lis education has not received direct attention in these three south asian countries as well perhaps realizing this void the indian association of teachers in lis iatlis chose equity of lis education as the theme for their annual conference in  and ten papers concentrated on equity as the major topic in the indian context siddamallaiah and karisiddappa have perceived a difference between equity and equality they define equity as the social or economic return that one gets proportionately to their investment in education equality is perceived as treating all with the same status they further discuss the tangible equity which are financial returns and intangible equity which are image and recognition received in return for one investments in education several other authors chetty kalra and singh reflect this definition in their papers however singh and varalakshmi have defined equity as the availability of the same opportunities for all for self actualization and social development irrespective of race religion gender caste geography and socioeconomic environment resembling the definition of indraratne however all these indian authors seem to echo the same viewpoint that the indian universities overproduce lis graduates and the output far exceeds the demand for librarians especially the distance education programs are contributing to this overproduction despite the overproduction of graduates the lis departments are littered with many issues like lack of qualified teachers and infrastructural facilities weaknesses in the curricula and absence of accreditation of lis programs as a result there are huge disparities in lis education across the states and levels of courses and this has affected the equity as defined by siddamallaiah and karisiddappa of lis education in a negative manner in their concluding remarks all the authors have stressed the need to improve the quality of the programs in order to improve the social and economic returns for lis education
a critical analysis of the equity of lis education programs in sri lanka  although the pakistan and bangladesh literature on lis education does not directly deal with equity several authors ameen islam and chowdhury mahmood have echoed the prevalence of issues similar to those in india it can be concluded that in bangladesh india and pakistan gender income language and sociocultural factors have not affected access to lis education because the literature denotes that the issue they have to deal with is the overproduction of lis graduates but the evidence in sri lanka according to irving and wijetunge and willson is that the student numbers are inadequate in the lis programs one of the main challenges the lis educators in sri lanka have to deal with is the increase in the number of lis students the mere lack of students in the lis programs makes one wonder whether there are any issues of equity in the lis education programs and sri lanka has to face this challenge alone in the south asian region in order to explore the equity of lis education programs in sri lanka lee  framework was considered as the most appropriate framework because as he states it is the framework used to analyse the equity of general education in the asian countries methodology the research question how equitable are the current lis education programs attempted to achieve three objectives  to provide a brief introduction to the current lis education programs and the educational institutions that offer those programs in sri lanka  to analyze critically the equity of the lis education programs with regard to gender income geographic region and language and  to make recommendations for the improvement of equity of the programs four principal methods were used to collect the data required for the main research  semi structured interviews  questionnaires  review of relevant documents and  participatory observations by the researcher semi structured interviews were carried with the course coordinators of  lis programs conducted during the   period and seven key policy makers in the lis profession questionnaires were used to collect data from  full time and part time lis faculty members questionnaires were also used to collect data from  of  identified lis students and  of  identified lis professionals in sri lanka during the same period many relevant documents for instance course handbooks promotional brochures were reviewed to obtain the original data required and published material were reviewed to develop a theoretical foundation to the study participatory observations by the researcher were used to compliment the data gathered through other methods utilizing the findings of this empirical survey on lis education a critical analysis of the equity of lis education in sri lanka was made according to the framework used by lee
 journal of education for library and information science equity of lis education lee in his study defines the four criteria used to analyze equity of education as follows  gender related equity this refers to the opportunities of the traditionally disadvantaged gender group ie females in their access to various levels of education in their opportunities for success in education and in their opportunities to make use of education as an asset for enhancing their life chances  income related equity this refers to the financially disadvantaged groups ie the income poor in their access to various levels of education and their opportunities for success in education  region related equity this refers to educational opportunities of the people living in disadvantaged regions in most cases the disadvantaged regions are rural but they can also be economically backward regions within an economy and also the income poor within urban areas  sociocultural related equity this refers to the educational opportunities of socioculturally disadvantaged groups in most cases they are ethnic minorities within the economy but sometimes women are also regarded as minorities in certain respects and their education opportunities are limited by sociocultural perceptions of women that are unfavorable for them to receive education in this article only language equity will be studied due to its specific nature within the sri lankan context the following sections critically evaluate the equity of lis education programs in sri lanka using this framework gender related equity statistics of gender related enrollments in lis education programs are not maintained by the respective educational institutes compilation of such statistics for the purpose of my research was not possible due to the time consuming nature of the task because it requires analyzing all the original applications of the students to identify their gender however participatory observations of the researcher as well as the interviews with the course co coordinators of the  lis education programs confirm that  to  of the students are female in all current lis programs except in the phd direct program according to the numbers of lis students in  table  it can be hypothesized that   to   are females this pattern conforms to gender stereotypes in the field of lis in some of the other developing countries for example females account for  of the lis students in kiribati and in vietnam also there is a female concentration in lis programs about  to  of the indian lis student population is also female the gender related issue in the sri lanka

 journal of education for library and information science income related equity according to the tuition fees of each course and the number of students enrolled in  table  it is evident that the student numbers are low in most of the lis programs and in  programs the number of students is fewer than  the observations have indicated that    of these lis students are from middleor low income groups and from rural areas the current lis education programs do have an income related equity issue in two aspects firstly even if the tuition fees of the lis programs are comparatively lower than those of the other programs researcher observations of various advertisements indicated that the tuition fees of the education programs in accountancy informationcommunication technology and management are three or four times more the programs are less equitable to the low income group secondly the students from high income families seem to be less attracted to the lis programs although there are no previous empirical studies on income related enrollments in the sri lankan lis education programs the situation can be explained using other socioeconomic studies in sri lanka although there is a high degree of equity between sri lankan families from various economic levels at primary junior secondary and senior secondary education levels the enrollments in tertiary education reveal sharp disparities between poor and non poor households tertiary enrollments are three times higher from non poor households than from poor households mora explains this relationship between the enrollment of students for tertiary education and the socio economic status of their families according to this author the low education levels and low skilled jobs of parents are associated with low access to higher education by their children families with a manager or a professional as the main householder are more likely to invest in education because they have better information about the advantages of higher education investments kaneko also explains that a positive relationship between family income levels and access to higher education is not only a result of the ability to pay the fees but parents with a higher income have created a large amount of cultural capital which helps the children to obtain higher academic standards hiring private tutors to help the children in preparing for admission examinations can contribute to higher rates of access to higher education from these families high income urban families also have the advantage of sending their children to selective private secondary schools which in turn increases the rate of access to higher education the world bank further states that tertiary education in sri lanka generates high private rate of return to individuals ie  for men and  for women while the social rate of return is   and  respectively such quantitative data are not available with regard to the lis profession in sri lanka however the research findings showed that  of the  lis education programs are not recognized by the employers and  programs are yet to be recognized discussions are going on between the educational institutions which offer these programs and the government authorities

 journal of education for library and information science of students in the lis programs leads to the conclusion that the hidden costs of travel and subsistence increase the cost of participation in addition to tuition fees and these further affect the limited access by the low income groups regionrelated equity sri lanka consists of nine administrative provinces northern eastern western southern central north central north western uva and sabaragamuwa as indicated in figure  and  out of  current lis programs are based only in the western province with a few exceptions table  diplis is offered in northern eastern southern and central provinces in addition to the western province and the ndt in the northern and central provinces in addition to the western province there are no programs offered at all in north central north western and uva provinces because of a lack of infrastructural facilities and the absence of professionals to provide leadership especially in the uva and north central provinces which are the poorest and the educationally most disadvantaged provinces lis education providers have not taken initiatives to offer programs the certificate program conducted in the sabaragamuwa province was also not started in  due to lack of students observations indicate that about  of the students in the lis programs are not from the western province but from other provinces according to the theories discussed with regard to the relationship between income and enrollments under the income related equity the students from western province  which is the wealthiest most literate and possesses the highest tertiary education attainment in sri lanka  may be attracted to other professional education programs which offer better career opportunities and financial prospects than the lis programs do but further empirical studies are required to establish this fact according to table  it is obvious that there is no regional equity in the present lis education programs it does not mean that the programs offered in western province are restricted to the students from that province but accessibility by the prospective students from other provinces is limited due to many reasons additional traveling and subsistence costs increase the expenditure on education which in turn affect accessibility by the students of low income groups this especially affects the lis programs in which a higher percentage of students are from low income groups the fact that a higher percentage is female also aggravates the problem because the family commitments as well as safety issues concerned with traveling limit their attendance at programs conducted in the western province at the same time limited financial capacity of the family forces the females to sacrifice their education for more crucial needs like food and shelter of others and the education of the male members of the family civil disturbances also affect the participation at programs conducted in the western province by the students from other

 journal of education for library and information science secondary school education in schools which provide better facilities and with a science background in the lis education system at the same time lis programs will not attract the best students from the low income families because of the low private rates of return for lis the study revealed that the regional distribution of the programs is highly centered in the western province restricting participation by the students from other provinces this limits the number of students in the lis programs and at the same time those who need to study lis for their professional development are not catered to adequately as an implication the library staff from the other provinces especially from the economically disadvantaged provinces often has to work without training leading to poor library services absence of tamil language programs has led to the under representation of ethnic minorities in the profession which in turn affects library services to the tamil speaking community because their needs and expectations are not represented in the lis education system and this is driving this ethnic minority towards a dangerous cycle of ethnic isolation within the discipline of lis in sri lanka in order to reduce the gender inequity in the lis programs it is recommended to provide incentives like scholarships and fellowships to encourage male enrollments at the same time the men who are holding higher positions in the lis domain must act as role models and attract male students to the classes with regard to the income inequity stakeholders need to address the issue from two aspects to attract students from high income families with professional parents and to attract the bright students from low income families in order to attract the children of professional parents it is necessary to raise the standards of the lis profession so that it is perceived as cultural capital by the parents of prospective students for example it is recommended to upgrade the existing three year diploma program of nilis to the bachelor of library and information management in consultation with the ugc so that a new degree program is offered in the lis discipline to attract the students from affluent families who would not otherwise consider enrolling for an lis program in order to address the issue of low private rates of return for lis qualifications the salary structure of lis professionals needs to be improved at the same time lis educators must take action to obtain recognition for the lis programs so that the students who complete these programs receive recognition and the financial benefits which will in turn increase the enrollments by the children of middleand high income families an incentive scheme should be implemented to provide learning opportunities to attract bright students from low income families at the same time employers can be encouraged to sponsor lis workers education and training programs in order to increase regional equity of the lis education programs it is recommended that the programs are offered in distance mode so that stu
