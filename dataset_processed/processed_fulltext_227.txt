social reform education and the library   sidney ditzion t nhe middle of the nineteenth century is generally conceded to have marked the inception of the free taxsupported town and city library in the united states the idea of organizing and supporting libraries in this manner developed from the experiences of many earlier library types state legislative libraries and district school libraries provided precedent for tax support proprietary and subscription libraries the lyceum denominational mechanics and mercantile libraries all illustrated the vast possibilities of and indeed created the need for centrally located public book collections the only one of these types that was in every sense public was the district school library its utter failure was clearly due to socio geographical contradictions rather than to popular resistance to culture the geographic unit and its income were too small hence in many school districts the tax became burdensome and finally there was an obvious loss of interest in preserving and circulating collections of limited size and content the fate of some of these libraries was complete dissolution others were eventually absorbed by public library systems the earliest real recognition of the principle of tax support in towns and cities is to be found in permissive laws passed in i  by the new hampshire and massachusetts state legislatures their example was followed in subsequent years by maine vermont and connecticut boston started the movement in  when it established its public library on broad popular t system of common schools in ohio barnard american journal of education vi    annual encyclopedia i p  ilibrary journal i  ioo merican library annual ii i pp i  ibid ii  p  x

 the library qudrterly evaluation of the role played by the specific social factors discussed in this article would be futile and indeed dangerous the complete picture of social backgrounds in the progress and expansion of the public library demands a development of many vital ideas among these are i education for intelligent participation in the mechanics of our political democracy  the perfectibility of man and his social relationships by means of the broadest possible diffusion of knowledge  the undercurrent of fear in some quarters of possible violence and disorder which might result from discontent plus ignorance  the attitudes of organized labor toward mass education through the medium of books and reading much can also be learned from a study of the impact of all these factors on the extension of library facilities the adaptation of service techniques and most important the selection of books
