 the library quarterly by sixty volumes donated by william lavalette and some seventy bound newspapers and several scrapbooks donated by john wesley cromwell despite these positive beginnings the black history collection grew slowly during the nineteenth century however the founding of organizations like the bethel literary and historical association  the american negro historical society  the negro society for historical research  and the association for the study of negro life and history  was reflective of and stimulated a growing interest in studying and collecting sources for black history during this period howard university was a natural seedbed for the further development of the intellectual discipline of black history and an obvious home for library materials to foster its study the university leading proponent of a separate research collection on black history was kelly miller a professor of mathematics and sociology   and dean of the college of arts and sciences   envisioning a national negroamericana museum and library miller persuaded his good friend the reverend jesse e moorland to donate his wide ranging private library on black history to the university for this purpose  p v moorland an alumnus and trustee of howard who served as general secretary of the ymca announced his gift of some  books pamphlets and other historical items in a letter to university president stephen m newman in his letter of december   moorland noted that his collection was regarded by many experts as probably the largest and most complete yet gathered by a single individual and that he was giving this collection to the university because it is the one place in america where the largest and best library on this subject of the negro and slavery should be constructively established it is also the place where our young people who have the scholarly instinct should have the privilege of a complete reference library on the subject  moorland also acknowledged that newman influence inspired his desire for historic research and that miller profound interest in seeing such a collection established motivated him to make the gift in accepting the donation the university board of trustees created the moorland foundation a library of negro life and housed it as a special collection in the new library building recently donated by andrew carnegie responses to the establishment of the moorland foundation which signified a conscious decision to promote the documentation and study of the black experience were positive and wide ranging they came from herbert putnam librarian of congress walter h page us ambassador to england albert bushnell hart professor at harvard  a full discussion of the proposal for a national library and museum can be found in

resources for scholars  ment into a thoroughly modern professional research organization that would produce research in addition to carrying out traditional curatorial and library functions the division would pursue the programmatic analytical collecting of documentary sources that would enable scholars to probe more deeply beneath the deceptively simple surfaces of black history and culture to achieve this the msrc would become a center of primary documentation and embark on a broad search for manuscript resources in such critical areas as journalism law medicine the arts education and social activism a number of manuscript collections had already been acquired before establishment of the manuscript division however there was no staff to process them and a huge backlog developed a turning point in the processing and management of manuscripts in the moorland spingarn collection was the award in may  of a ford foundation grant for the hiring of trained personnel in manuscripts and archival management between  and  substantial progress was made in processing manuscript collections during the reorganization plans were made to divide the manuscript division into four constituent departments manuscript music oral history and prints and photographs because manuscripts and archives were increasingly demanded by scholars and graduate students immediate attention was given to the development of a sound program of manuscript acquisition processing preservation and management since  a major acquisitions program has been aggressively pursued resulting in a tremendous increase in the division holdings and a growth more rapid than that of any other unit of the msrc these acquisitions have included the papers of distinguished blacks in a broad spectrum of fields among them architecture journalism medicine social science education religion fine arts social work politics natural science and law as well as massive collections of organizational and institutional records the division now houses for example the papers of paul robeson vernon jordan charles c diggs jr max yergan william patterson the congressional black caucus mordecai wyatt johnson benjamin e mays george b murphy jr charles h houston john warren davis the afro amenrcan series of newspapers charles drew ernest e just mary frances berry frankie freeman rayford logan the ancient egyptian arabic order nobles of the mystic shrine and the law firm of cobb howard hayes and windsor coupled with such earlier acquisitions as the papers of alain locke and e franklin frazier the manuscript division is now the largest and most diverse repository of primary research materials documenting the black experience in america in  a guide to its collections was published  registers of processed collections are also in
