preparing the next generation of librarians for family and community engagement  this family focused perspective is critical as us library statistics show that parents are more likely than other adults to use library services and having a child or grandchild increases an adults use of library services horrigan  miller zickuhr rainie  purcell  families are also important for libraries to focus on since families provide its members with physical necessities and emotional care although practices and routines vary by community culture and available resources families are integral to instilling into the next generation the moral and ethical beliefs that a society values rogoff  families also matter for childrens academic success family engagement in education is related to a range of benefits for students across the developmental spectrum including improved school readiness higher student achievement better social skills and behavior and an increased likelihood of high school graduation hayakawa englund warner richter  reynolds  jeynes  families are also the main source of advice for youth on matters of post secondary education and careers oymak  statistics show however that family life in the united states is changing at a rapid pace one in four c hildren live with a family member born outside of the united states and increasingly children are cared for by single p arents and grandparents many of whom are actively employed in the workforce generations united  pew research center  zong b atalova  hallock  in addition growing income inequality within the united states has made it difficult for many families to make ends meet stiglitz  in this increasingly complex and dynamic world families visit libraries to spend quality time together in an environment that offers something for everyone of any age families come to libraries to learn new ideas and techniques to support their childrens learning and development they congregate at libraries to connect with other families and thereby share the communitys knowledge and sense of belongingness and grow united families go to the library to seek out referrals and services in the community to support family well being they also look to librarians as media mentors who can guide families to understand the best ways to incorporate digital m edia into childrens education haines campbell  association for l ibrary service to children  i nstitute of museum and library s ervices  lopez caspe  m cwilliams  lopez caspe  simpson  neuman  celano  weiss caspe lopez  mcwilliams  for all of these reasons family engagement in libraries can be broadly defined as the process by which families and libraries join together to share the responsibility of supporting childrens learning and development from birth through adulthood because family well being is inextricably linked to the capacity of families to create a pathway for successful and productive lives both within school and beyond family engagement is also often expanded to include adult literacy and lifelong learning and access to formal and informal community social supports
 caspe lopez understanding and promoting family engagement in libraries is critical for a variety of reasons perhaps most importantly because as free institutions libraries offer services and resources to bring about educational equity research shows that due largely to economic constraints families from low income households are significantly less able to complement inschool learning with quality out of school learning opportunities which has a negative impact on childrens learning and development duncan  murnane  the library can shield children from these effects national data sets from the united states show that compared to families from upper income homes parents from lower income households say that the library helps them find information for their children allows free access to the internet and provides quiet study spaces a broad selections of e books and the opportunity for interactive learning swan  still there is much work to be done to overcome lingering disparities in library usage by income and ethnic background neuman  celano  librarian preparation for family and community engagement library preparation programs are one vital element in a system of continuous professional learning that can help libraries meet the new needs of families and communities however informal landscape analyses of the curricula of many library and information science degree programs reveal that while there are opportunities for aspiring librarians to develop competencies to work with children youth and young adults there are often very few specializations and courses devoted to developing skills around cultural diversity and community engagement with virtually none focused on families jaeger bertot  subramaniam  m semmel personal communication january   university of maryland nd this orientation toward children and youth without a broader conception of their lifelong learning situated within families and communities is detrimental to librarians who will enter their jobs with little training and marketable knowledge and skills to meet the needs of one of their main constituents it also becomes a missed opportunity for families to receive the full range of services they deserve accordingly library educators are being challenged to develop curriculum and learning experiences that will equip librarians to be innovators and continuous learners and to critically engage with families and communities abels howarth  smith  the importance of reskilling librarians to become leaders in serving the information needs of communities was underscored in a  national forum sponsored by the institute of museum and library services the results of that meeting reinforce the fact that libraries must be more outward facing and can head in this direction by recruiting more diverse librarians to reflect new community demographics by building bridges within the community and the rest of the world and by adapting to the future with considerations for who will teach future students and how will they be taught abels et al this new

preparing the next generation of librarians for family and community engagement  actual interactions they will have with each other and the ways in which they will build relevant collections services and programs knowing what is appropriate at each stage of development can also help librarians make recommendations for collections programs and resources that are well fitted to childrens needs it also helps set realistic expectations for what family learning events can and should look like for example it would be considered developmentally appropriate for a group of  month olds to get up and walk around during storytime or for a group of teens to want opportunities to talk among themselves without adults present relationship building skills library educators stress that the main skill that new librarians need is the ability to build trusting relationships with families and communities that last over time a key component of this is cultural competence library educators think of cultural competence as librarians ability to interact with families and communities of different cultures and to recognize accept and respect the legitimacy of families and communities language culture and practices cultural competence is the ability to take families perspectives listen to them de personalize and reflect as one faculty member described it is about students being willing to inward gaze look at their own backgrounds and shift their perspective as a different library educator explained students need to be prepared to engage diverse communities which focuses on teaching students to decenter themselves and in a way deprioritize themselves as a starting point towards community engagement there needs to be an emphasis on listening and learning how to listen this involves developing empathy  how do they learn how to take a back seat to themselves the notion of cultural competence extends to the ability to partner with community organizations as well organizations such as schools afterschool programs medical homes senior centers and even parent teacher associations play a role in familys lives and also have their own organizational cultures to coordinate with these organizations librarians have to take into account the strengths and limitations of these institutions in particular in relation to their leadership and resources for example one library educator stated librarians need inter organizational cultural competence so people think in terms of what are the strategies missions and purposes of the institutions with whom they will be called on to coordinate thats the baseline for collaboration and they need to understand inequity in our society and that exist in each of these programs in terms of their access to resources a library has a reliable source of funding    whereas some of these other organizations are having a difficult time with funding and staff turnover
 caspe lopez developing a rich set of communication skills is also essential to relationship building communication skills range from the basic such as saying hello or offering a handshake when introductions are made to talking with families about the value of play and discussing sensitive library policies as part of their communication skills librarians must also learn to listen and to raise families views in order to create programs and services with and for them rather than fixing what librarians think are families concerns or blindly adopting programs that other libraries have developed library educators also note that in serving the larger community librarians must also be able to clearly articulate the value of the public library and its role and place in solving wider community problems in addition library educators identify flexibility as a key skill trusting relationships develop when librarians are flexible and tailor their p rograms and services to accommodate different family configurations including multiple generations of families learning together eg young children teens and grandparents one library educator noted families come in multiple configurations ranging from babies to greatgrandmothers and having skills to connect with people across that s pectrum is really valuable librarians are called upon to develop skills that allow them to identify and problem solve solutions among families these are likely to focus on the barriers to library patronage and at the community level to serving the less advantaged such as the homeless and the incarcerated one library educator felt that librarians must develop solutions that fit the unique issues that communities face another explained we want to develop the global or evergreen skills that will help librarians make good decisions moving forward its the skills to connect to networks and do a scan of your community and handle community questions i want my grads to make good decision not someone told me family programs are important im going to do it internalizing a professional role the main dispositionor inherent belief stance or attitudethat library educators aspire to promote in new librarians so that they can effectively practice family and community engagement is the internalization of the librarians role as a professional who has a responsibility to help people librarians are in a profession of public service that requires creative knowledge and a certain visible and unspoken power in the lives of children families and communities library educators recognize that this calls for librarians to be more than merely employees it calls for them to challenge the status quo to meet the needs of their families and communities it obligates them to be clear about the values and ethical foundations of librarianship in relation to the communities and families they serve and it requires them to advocate for families rights to privacy and equal access and service regardless of librarians personal beliefs
preparing the next generation of librarians for family and community engagement  one library educator explained how being clear on the values and responsibilities of the profession can lead to librarians assuming new roles in serving families and reorienting services toward families rather than children for example instead of having librarians lead storytimes librarians instead can support and teach caregivers to carry out these activities by doing so librarians are elevating their professional skills and simultaneously empowering families to be proactive in developing childrens activities and to be the leaders in their childrens learning as professionals librarians must also feel comfortable being leaders and must embrace a sense of comfort in managing and supervising those within the library as well as taking an active role in the public sphere and not sitting by as passive bystanders instead they must question assumptions about how community and family needs are raised and met one library educator explained librarians have to venture out of their comfort zone to engage with key decision makers in society to be able to participate in the decisions that are being made librarians come with a certain mental mode of what they notice from a historical perspective  taking a neutral stance being passive bystanders  and so we need to train a new generation of librarians to step out of the comfort zone and take a stand it is when librarians are able to assume this stance and use their knowledge and problem solving skills that librarians families and communities can join together and create a mindset that anything is possible as librarians develop new roles and services for and with families and communities library educators acknowledge that librarians also need to develop a set of strong leadership skills that enable these actions to be successful they need to know how to market and show the value of the library through social media and other digital platforms management involves knowing how to plan schedule budget fundraise and write grants continuous learning involves collecting analyzing and gaining insight from data and communicating it to others to improve services and convey their impact for example one library educator noted librarians need to be action researchers the word doesnt get out about what we have been able to do in terms of quality and quantity of impact so how do we tell the story of the impact that we are having librarians need to be able to tell their stories through evidence and through quantitative and qualitative data that is systemically collected lastly because library services are evolving rapidly especially with new technologies librarians also are responsible for their own professional learning they must seek opportunities to keep abreast of research and practices that improve their services for families and communities
 caspe lopez experiential and connected learning approaches to promote familyand community engagement competencies consistent with literature on the subject experiential and connected learning is the main pedagogical method that library educators use to develop the knowledge skills and dispositions that they identified as what new librarians need in order to meaningfully engage families and communities although library educators rely on lectures readings and critical in person and online discussion to promote competencies it is hands on learning that produces the greatest learning results library educators are adopting teaching methods to help students  reorient their focus to the end user of libraries  for example children and families  and to the specific needs of the community  shift from a library centric mindseteg counting the number of patrons computer terminals and programs offeredto one that focuses on community centered impact and  compare traditional library practices with those that are innovative and are truly engaging communities these themes run through courses that are both online and faceto face families however are only in a few instances a priority in this work much more frequently library educators focus on communities and youth services while families become the audience for the interactions only tangentially below we provide several examples of experiential and connected learning methods that library educators use with their students knowing families and communities to help aspiring librarians come to know and understand families and communities library educators employ a variety of different pedagogical methods that give librarians a window into families perspectives desires and values design thinking library educators use a teaching approach called human centered design thinking design thinking opens new possibilities for reinventing how libraries can partner with and engage families and communities a human centered design thinking approach begins with empathy putting oneself in anothers place and imagining what that person feels and e xperiences abels et al  reilly  weiss et al  developing empathy is one way to move from family engagement practices that librarians think families need and want to ones based on what families desire and value for example the school of library and information science at simmons college has offered the library test kitchen in partnership with harvard university graduate school of design in this course students engage in a human centered design thinking course where they tackle questions such as how libraries can operate as spaces of civic
