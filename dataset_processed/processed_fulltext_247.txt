 the library quarterly was still too busily engaged in conquering the wilderness in unearthing bibliographic material ludewig mentions the difficulties encountered in one place he wrote for in europe the gathering of accurate bibliographical notices is an easy and pleasant task when compared with the trouble and difficulties to be encountered in the same pursuit in this country where the sources of bibliographical instruction as far as they exist are scattered here and there where the collector as previously remarked must be constantly on his guard and can rely only on himself for every accurate notice which he may want and where besides the attempt to supply these notices has but very little of the spiritual pleasure of a trip from page to page from book to book but requires an actual and fatiguing tour in search of literature it requires indeed a true bibliophile voyageur from the material collected during his travels and earlier studies ludewig published the articles in the serapeum referred to above which dealt with the bibliography libraries and book trade of the united states the first article consisted of a bibliography of bibliographies on america it was probably the earliest work of its kind justin winsor described ludewig accounts of american libraries and bibliography as the first contributions to this subject not only was each entry in the bibliography fully described but a complete bibliographic history of every item was included ludewig compiled the list in a manner which left little doubt as to his high scholarship or professional integrity ludewig succeeding articles in the serapeum contained a detailed description of the libraries of the united states although his list was not so comprehensive as the later jewett compendium as a pioneer effort it is not without interest and value whereas jewett listed over six hundred libraries ludewig described approximately two hundred none of the principal libraries however was omitted by the latter ludewig was quite cognizant of the fact that his compilation was not an exhaustive one for he stated that his list could easily have been tripled if time and funds had been available whereas jewett obtained his material largely through the questionnaire method ludewig was obliged to rely mainly on personal visits for his source of information a far more costly procedure in speaking of his difficulties he observed that the traveler too often discovers in the south what he should have seen in the north from whence he has just come and similarly learns upon returning to the east from the west what he should have visited in the latter region ludewig arranged his data alphabetically by state and city in so far as he was able he included in each notice a brief historical statement of the institution a description of the book collection and a listing of the printed catalogs unlike many other european travelers ludewig was enthusiastic about america moreover he was most liberal in his praise of american libraries in contrast to the rigidity of european library rules the ease with which books were made accessible to readers in the united states was a source of no small wonder and delight to him a few of ludewig observations concerning american libraries are of sufficient importance to warrant summarization in one place he gave it as his opinion that no country had done as much for libraries in the last seventy years as the united states at another point he observed that although many of the american  the literature of american local history new york r craighead i p xviii  narrative and critical history of america boston houghton mifflin  co i i v
hermann ernst ludewig   i libraries were small when measured in terms of volumes alone their usefulness was far greater than similar institutions in europe by reason of the printed catalogs that were in current vogue the idea of printed annual reports appealed to him but he considered it regrettable that libraries did not exchange such reports and it distressed him even more to find that some libraries did not have on hand an unbroken sequence of their own reports equally disturbing to him was the fact that libraries did not exchange catalogs very little escaped the notice of ludewig he described the various types of libraries outlined the method by which they were organized commented on the manner in which book purchases were made and noted the use that was made of american libraries in addition to the serapeum articles ludewig published as a result of his tour of the united states the literature of american local history the latter is a bibliographical work of some fourteen hundred items consisting of historical sources pertaining to the individual states counties cities and towns of the united states it is restricted to books either published by americans at home or abroad or reprinted in the united states in a lengthy introduction which is largely devoted to paying a glorious tribute to this country the author offers some general comments on the nature of bibliography it is significant that in i ludewig found it necessary to justify the publication of a bibliographical work in this country in such elementary terms as the following  true bibliographical knowledge is not only the safest insurance against literary depredations and mystifications and the surest test of originality but also an actual savings bank for time and money in literary pursuits historical sciences especially being founded on former records only and depending principally upon a thorough and critical use and knowledge of existing sources stand more in need than others of the aid of bibliography as the topographical statistics of literature one of his principal purposes in compiling this work ludewig announced was to stimulate interest in the study and writing of american history and in the founding of an american historical library where there could be deposited as complete a collection as possible of writings concerning the history of the whole american continent to what extent ludewig succeeded in his aim and what influence he exerted on the subsequent writings of american history cannot be measured this much at least is known no less distinguished a bibliographer than henry harrisse asserted that ludewig work prompted the publication of a series of local state bibliographies in norton literary letter three of which were published the reception that was given to the literature of american local history at the time it appeared was extremely disappointing to the compiler ludewig had five hundred copies of the work privately printed half of this number he sent to his friends in europe the other half he distributed to libraries and to the literati of america of the two hundred and fifty copies distributed in this country ludewig received only twenty seven letters of acknowledgment this was a shocking blow to him the failure to recognize the immediate value of ludewig work however is probably to be accounted for as already indicated by the fact that the art of bibliography was an innovation in this country in the i when ludewig came to publish a supplement iliterature of american local history p xvi i bibliotheca americana vetustissima new york geo p philes i pp xxxvii xxxix  the literature of american local history first supplement new york r craighead i
 the library quarterly two years later he struck off only thirty copies sending them to the persons who hal acknowledged the earlier work another one of the many intellectual interests of ludewig was the study of ethnology particularly in the field of comparative philology for years he collected material on the history of language of especial interest to him was the linguistics of the aborigines of north america after some ten years of research in this area ludewig compiled a bibliography entitled the literature of american aboriginal languages which he intended to make the first part of a more extended study on the history of language the bibliography while in manuscript form was first deposited by its compiler in the library of the american ethnological society of new york at the request of nicolas trnbner a prominent english philologist and bibliographer and also a publisher of no small repute ludewig turned the manuscript over to him for publication and it was published posthumously under trubner editorship the literature of american aboriginal languages contains references to over five hundred languages and dialects used by about nine hundred tribes sabin describes the work in these words as a monument of linguistic industry it is scarcely excelled for several decades it remained the principal bibliographical source on the subject so much for ludewig the bibliographer now a few concluding remarks about ludewig the man when ludewig returned from his tour of the united states in i he made brooklyn new york his permanent residence without unnecessary delay he applied for american citizenship and became naturalized in due course with equal dispatch he also applied for admission to the new york bar where before long he gained the respect and admiration of jurist and layman alike but as was the case in dresden the practice of law did not interfere with his many leisure time activities which he continued to pursue with avidity his private library of some fourteen hundred volumes provided him with the tools for carrying on his independent studies he contributed numerous papers to the learned societies of america as well as of europe in addition he was secretary of the american ethnological society of new york he was elected a member of the new york georgia new hampshire and iowa historical societies he was a corresponding member of the new england historic genealogical society and a leading spirit in the german emigrant society he corresponded with several editors in germany furnishing them with information about america late in i however his career came to an abrupt end he met with sudden death on december i at the early age of forty seven what position does ludewig hold in the field of american bibliography from the standpoint of professional bibliography winsor considered him as one of the earliest workers in the new spirit the following estimate of ludethis work related only to new york and was also published in the literary world iii i  so i london trubner  co i is j sabin a dictionary of books relating to america new york j sabin  sons  x  ibid i upon ludewig death a sales catalog of his private library was issued under the title bibliotheca bibliographia new york i although several copies are extant the writer was unable to consult any of them i ludewig nonbibliographical writings are not included in this paper iop cit p
hermann ernst ludewig   wig by a contemporary is perhaps representative of the man and his work among the losses in the literary circle of this country that of hermann ermst ludewig will long be felt he had a mind capable of accomplishing what few are able to perform in estimating the amount of his labors it should be remembered that his works were not written in his own language and that he had to overcome obstacles with which a native does not have to contend he was benevolent without ostentation and felt happy in the performance of labors that he was conscious would result in good to the world but death is no respecter of talents nor of moral worth and in the midst of his usefulness and the fulness of his powers this brilliant scholar has been torn away yet his life has not been fruitless and his name will be cherished hereafter as that of a true benefactor of his race ludewig contribution to bibliography it may be fairly concluded lies not so much in the intrinsic merit of the bibliographies which he prepared though they are useful to this day as in the fact that he was the first to have compiled them most of them at the present time have been superseded by more voluminous works but hermann ludewig was a pioneer a trail blazer and therein lies his significance  editorial historical magazine p
