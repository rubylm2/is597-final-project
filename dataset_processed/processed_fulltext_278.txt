final comment can a hard science answer hard questions a response to sandstrom and sandstrom james m nyce and nancy p thomas it is clear from the sandstroms recent comment in the library quarterly  that we all share a sincere desire to improve lis research where we differ is on how this may best be achieved  this takes us in our response to questions that relate to theories of science and their epistemologies the relationship between science and philosophy and the contribution ethnography can make to the research enterprise alan r sandstrom and pamela effrein sandstrom have argued that debates over issues like these contribute little to the practice of science in the lab or the field  p  we disagree hard sciencenonscience proponents of hard science consider human events actions and objects as both subject to and best understood in terms of general rules laws and principles it is not surprising then that they see rule law and principle as goals at which ethnography can and should arrive in short if as ethnographers we work hard enough and smart enough human artifacts and events can be reduced to universal rules and principles ones that may even have mathematical validity however to label the methodologies of hard science as scientific and alternative approaches as antiscience or nonscience is to privilege positivistic claims to knowledge of the human condition  p  in ways that we believe actually work to the disadvantage of science lis researchers and library practitioners let us explain while we do not deny the productivity of science we believe it is necessary to reclaim the experiential basis for science against  claims to escape it  p  although those who privilege hard science seem to agree that science is context bound in both its agendas and ramifications what they do not acknowledge is that the percepts norms and conventions of science are also themselves historical and cultural artifacts in short for them it is business as usual however these conventions cannot be separated from the context in which they are created and repro direct correspondence to the authors at the school of library and information management  commercial street emporia kansas  telephone    fax   e mail nycejameemporiaedu  school of library and information management  commercial street emporia kansas  telephone    fax    e mail thomasnaxemporiaedu libraiy quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
 the library quarterly duced history and culture determine what are taken to be the scientific canons of evidence  p  at any given point in time it is not enough to say that scientists operate within a sociopolitical context what also needs to be acknowledged is that the conventions that scientists follow cannot be separated from the context in which they are created and reproduced in addition no matter how robust an analytic we employ it is not possible well to reach through culture to something like nature for this reason neutrality in terms of a scientific knowledge is an unachievable goal moreover we believe that the social context and the socially constructed nature of experience are effectively denied when distinctions between physical and social facts collapse and methods designed to explore the physical world are applied to the social order to finesse the difference between social facts and the facts of the natural world is to deny the constructed nature of social reality and to treat language as though it is representational it is to believe that a one to one correspondence exists between words and things in the world  in short to argue that language simply has nothing to do with scientific knowledge makes little sense to us  p  to make an appeal as the sandstroms do to validity and reliability does not make this issue go away  p  the rigor and precision the sandstroms demand of ethnography emerge from a belief that a physics of society is both possible and necessary this is a logical but unfortunate consequence of classifying human events and artifacts as natural  p  however opting for a social physics based on nature and rule will in the end obscure not clarify the issues the lis research community takes as its own in brief it can be argued that culture and society and their operations and objects are not of the same order of things as those purported to be in nature one thinks here of weber according to this view human objects events and actions emerge neither from nature nor from the supernatural  p  but from history as such the human enterprise has much more to do with intention and meaning than with what science might call cause or event what human artifacts reflect and embody instead are negotiations over structure power and agency science and philosophy further if it is necessary to separate science and philosophy for a scientific ethnography to emerge  p  we distrust both the intent and the project while this is no place to replay the history and philosophy of science that has taken shape over the last century or so many have argued persuasively that methodologies born of physics envy  p  have not achieved what they promised in spite of claims that thanks to scientific ethnography our knowledge of the human condition is far in advance of what it was even a few years ago  p  we are not even close to creating a science of society  p  while many would still welcome a social scientific newton anthony giddens reminds us that these folks are not only waiting for a train that won arrive theye in the wrong station altogether  p  this stance is not radical nor is it particularly postmodern  pp   in fact it represents a consensus within both sociology and anthropology   furthermore it is not unprecedented all we have to do is look at franz boas the american anthropologist to whom we and the sandstroms have referred early in his career boas believed and wrote that the physical and historical sciences had equal value depending on the investigation and the subject  only under pres
final comment  sure for example would boas write of the historical sciences as a supplementary tool  p   p  however as time went on when it came to human objects and events boas become less confident of a science that claimed social artifacts were rule or law bound  p  in fact by the end of his life we find boas writing in preparing my doctor thesis i had to use photometric methods to compare intensities of light in pursuit of the experiments i was led to consider the quantitative values of sensations in the course of this investigation i learned to recognize that there are domains of our experience in which concepts of quantity of measures that can be added or subtracted and with which i was accustomed to operate were not applicable  p  research agenda ethnography and lis we question the claim that a scientific ethnography has led to a revolution in the study of human behavior  p  in fact historically the failure of social positivism to answer some of the knottiest of the problems facing society is exactly what has driven so many researchers to pursue alternative research paths when we turn to research in lis we would argue that the most significant problems are those that involve the sociocultural aspects of issues like database design information literacy and information seeking and transfer these issues not only cannot be addressed from within a positivist agenda they cannot even be raised michael h harris  for example has argued that the acceptance of a pluralist philosophy by the library community since the late nineteenth century has rendered invisible the cultural social and political contexts within which information and information artifacts are created and distributed we would argue that the same problem can be found in hard science and scientific ethnography because they too fail to acknowledge the constructed nature of science and of the ontologies and epistemologies that support it  p  we have argued elsewhere for a strong ethnography one that starts with issues like these   the task is to not just to ask what meaning is for example or how it gets constructed and revised it is also to ask about those structures that inform and determine what meaning is taken to be in short what we also want to get at are the basic assumptions and categories that inform social life for example we would argue that ethnography requires the investigation of what others take to be common sense this would include looking at both the enactment and production of common sense which is recoverable it would as well be an inquiry into the structures and resources that make common sense however defined both possible and fundamental  p   p  this is precisely the kind of foundational analysis that a scientific ethnography neglects and this weakens both the ethnographic project and the results it can achieve the point we want to make here is that however one classes or defines the objects one studies there will be in pragmatic and analytic terms wins and losses if we were to read human events and artifacts as natural objects we would have to give up culture and society for which it is difficult to build rules and laws this reduction would make it difficult if not impossible to consider the role culture and society have in lis issues and to add to our knowledge of meaning intention and structure we regard the latter to be both critical and foundational and we agree with harris that when science and method are framed in terms of law and rule this leads to too much trivial work on the wrong questions  p  a scientific ethnography cannot begin to ask let alone answer that most fun
 the library quarterly damental of questions about the social world what is going on here  if we are to answer the hard questions those that have to do with meaning intention and structure we cannot reduce ethnography to a positivist project to mistake culture for nature obscures rather than illuminates events and objects in the social world to argue as the sandstroms have that scientific ethnography transcends tribal group gender social class race and religion  p  does not negate their effects what it does instead is hide them from view references  sandstrom alan r and sandstrom pamela effrein science and nonscience in qualitative research a response to thomas and nyce library quarterly  april    thomas nancy p and nyce james m qualitative research in lis redux a response to a re turn to positivistic ethnography libraty quarterly  january     deetz stanley democracy in an age of corporate colonization albany state university of new york press   wittgenstein ludwig philosophical investigations oxford blackwell   horn jim qualitative research literature a bibliographic essay library trends  spring     giddens anthony new rules of sociological method new york basic books   geertz clifford the interpretation of cultures new york basic books   boas franz the study of geography science      bunzl matti franz boas and the humboldtian tradition from volksgeist and nationalcharakter to an anthropological concept of culture in volksgeist as method and ethic edited by george w stocking pp   madison university of wisconsin press   boas franz letter to science science     boas franz franz boas in i believe edited by clifton fadiman pp   new york simon  schuster   harris michael h state class and cultural reproduction toward a theory of library service in the united states advances in librarianship      nyce james m and lwgren jonas towards foundational analysis in human computer interaction in social and interactional dimensions of human computer interfaces edited by peterj thomas pp   cambridge cambridge university press   bader gail and nyce james m when only the self is real theory and practice in the development communityjournal of computer documentation  february    goffman erving frame analysis new york harper
