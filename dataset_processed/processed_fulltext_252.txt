children and the public library i purpose february  the california library association formed a committee of those interested in studies on child psychology related to library work at the first meeting of the committee it was voted that a subcommittee be appointed to work out plans for observing the recreational reading of children whose reading ages have been determined jasmine britton librarian of the los angeles city school library was made chairman of this subcommittee miss britton immediately made plans for a preliminary study of the type of children who had recently obtained cards from the various branches such a study was carried out with the co operation of eva g leslie principal of children work in the los angeles public library and the psychology and educational research division of the los angeles city schools this study took into consideration the intelligence quotient and reading ability of the children and while nothing conclusive could be deduced from a first study and one so limited in size it revealed a grouping of intelligence and a level of reading comprehension above normal the results seemed to indicate that there are large numbers of children in the schools who are slow readers and mentally retarded and who do not use the public library as a check on the preliminary study miss britton made arrangements for a much more extensive investigation the purpose of the study reported herein is to present facts as shown  this investigation was made by mr alfred s lewerenz statistician of the los angeles city schools at the request of a committee of psychologists school supervisors and librarians appointed by the sixth district of the california library association  the child and the new psychology libraries xxxv     faith e smith committee of psychologists ibid pp    alfred s lewerenz educational information concerning a sampling of  children who recently have become members of the los angeles public library los angeles educational research bulletin x

the library quarterly  iii results in summarizing data comparisons with the previous study and with contrasting information should serve to clarify the meaning of the figures obtained a number of cases  each of the fifty branch libraries made out cards for  children drawing children books on a given date making the total possible number of cases  when the cards finally came in from the school counselors the total had been reduced by  leaving  cases of this number about  per cent were usable in the statistical study of the incomplete returns counselors reported that about  per cent of the children had moved had been promoted to antable i number of cases no percentage classification public school with data   public school without data    parochial school without data  military and other schools without data      other school were out sick or had died approximately  per cent of the cases came from parochial schools it was not possible to secure the necessary data for these children the figures are as given in table i while some data were supplied on  of the cases the full number was not accounted for on any one item the totals ranged all the way from  for actual grade placement down to  for reasoning in arithmetic b number of schools served by library branches  in this sampling of a typical day the number of schools being served by a branch ranged from one to fourteen the median number of schools served by a branch was five in many cases pupils seem to prefer a distant branch to the one near the school table ii shows the distribution of schools served this table should be

the library quarterly  much the same the main difference was that in the first instance children were those registering to become members while in the second the cases were children actually drawing children books the latter method serves better to select children who are actual patrons of the library the two criteria however are probably sufficiently similar to permit the comparison of both groups on similar items d number of pupils by grades  there were  cases for which the actual grade placement of the child was known table v number of pupils drawing books according to their grade in school no of pupils grade percentage i   ii    ill   iv   v    vi   vii   viii   ix   x oi i xi   xii   i total    while the original plan was to base the study on elementary schools alone actually there were children secured in the sampling from the first through the twelfth grades no special significance can be attached to the figures given in the lower part of table v since these children came to the section of the library intended for younger children however it is interesting to note that the children section appeals most to pupils in the fourth fifth and sixth grades with the largest percentage of children  per cent occurring in the sixth grade the median child was found to be a beginning v a pupil by the time children reach the third grade they are beginning to use the library in relatively large numbers
children and the public library  relatively few children come to the children section after they have passed the eighth grade in fact there is a big fallingoff after the sixth grade when many of the pupils are transferred to junior high school this decrease is explained in part by the use of junior high school libraries and the adult section of the public library in the preliminary study the main difference was noticed in the third grade of the children sampled at that time thirdtable vi percentage of boys and girls using libraries by grades totals for boys and girls separately girls difference boys grade per cent per cent per cent i o o i o ii     o o iii   i iv  j    v     vi    vii  o    viii    ix      x     xi    xii    total      graders most frequently applied for membership otherwise the tendencies were the same including the large number of sixthgraders the figures indicate that nearly two thirds of the readers are included in grades iv v and vi e sex by grades  more girls than boys drew books from the children section there were  girls and  boys this means that there were only about  per cent as many boys drawing books as there were gihs this is almost exactly the same ratio found for boys and girls applying for membership in the preliminary study the distributions in table vi are given in percentages for purposes of comparison table vi reduces both groups to a common denominator and
  the library quarterly is useful in comparing the number of boy and girl patrons assuming equal populations it will be noted that the girls in the first second and third grades do not come to the library quite as much as the boys there being a difference of about  per cent however in the fourth fifth and sixth grades the girls read relatively more than the boys here the difference in favor of the girls amounts to nearly  per cent the biggest difference in the patronage of table vii ratio of boys and girls by grades using total for boys and girls together as a base girls boys difference grade per cent per cent per cent i oo  o ii   o ill     iv    v     vi    vii     viii   l   ix i   oi x  oi  xi    xii oi    total        boys and girls in the children section seems to come in the sixth grade in actual number of cases there were only  per cent as many boys drawing books as there were girls then in grade vii and above the boys draw relatively more children books as shown by an approximately  per cent difference this fact is consistent with the facts concerning the earlier adolescence of girls the column at the right shows the difference in percentage for each grade using the percentage for girls as a basis to help explain the foregoing tendencies the data are presented in another form table vii this time the boys and girls in each grade are given in percentages of the total for both
children and the public library  boys and girls the other table gave the percentage of boys in each grade for the total number of boys and the same for the girls it will be seen that of the combined total for both boys and girls the former amounted to  per cent and the latter to  per cent the same estimate for the preliminary study was also found and is given in table viii for comparison both studies yielded approximately the same preponderance of girl readers table vii permits a comparison of boys and girls in the various grades by actual numbers it will be observed that in the first grade each sex is represented by  per cent from grade table viii percentage of boys and girls of total for preliminary and follow up studies girls boys total study per cent per cent per cent preliminary     ioo Ð¾ follow up     ioo Ð¾ ii through grade vi there is a steady increase in numbers then there is a decided dropping off in the number of girls in the children section thus while in all there were only about  per cent as many boys as girls drawing books the boys were approximately as numerous as the girls in all grades but ii to vi tables vi and vii seem to indicate with respect to the children included in this study that  girls are more inclined to draw books from the library than are boys  girls display a faster development in reading interest than do boys  both boys and girls reach the peak of their reading of children books in the sixth grade and  girls show a faster decrease in the reading of children books after the sixth grade f racial groups represented many pupils of foreign extraction were included in the study data as to race were given on  cards and table ix shows the distribution of races in terms

 the library quarterly s in comparing the library cases with unselected children of about the same mentality they were in all cases doing better work it would seem that library patrons have an added interest in their school work not found in children even of approximate mentality t using teachers judgments for library cases and typical children the ratings indicated that there were almost once again as many good readers among the library cases as there were in the unselected group u according to the teacher ratings there were half again as many library children who were marked good in arithmetic as compared with ordinary cases on the other hand only half as many library cases were marked poor in arithmetic v a summary of data available for a few cases secured in surveys a year or more ago indicate at the time that library patrons were accelerated chronologically were superior mentally and were above norm in all their academic subjects except reasoning in arithmetic in this last subject they were still above the standard set by the city as a whole v summary briefly this study indicates  children who draw children books are more often than not of a superior type mentally and scholastically  many children of subnormal mentality do not make use of the children section of the public library alfred s lewerenz los angeles city schools
