inovember   core values bad faith and democracy john buschman abstract core values of librarianship are being fundamentally challenged and have been for some time it is a time for reflection on and clarification of them because how they are understood communicated and accomplished in light of november   calls for it the recent election is just a manifestation of political social economic and cultural shifts under way for some time that brought the disjunctures of how we approach and understand our core values to the surface essentially we are playing out very old tropes in the profession by casting our values as neutral instrumental and technocraticplaying directly to the impulses of our neoliberal age and distorting core values t is a time for reflection and clarification in our field core values of librarianship are being fundamentally challenged and have been for some time no new set of values will be forwarded here nor a novel interpretation the american library association ala  has adequately consolidated an expression of them in a list linked to the wide variety of policies on the books rather it is how these are understood communicated and accomplished in light of november   that calls for clarification the recent election is the most recent manifestation of the political social economic and cultural shifts under way for some time with which a learned professionif it deserves the namemust grapple the task here is to highlight a fundamental and disturbing shift that the election brought to the surface and its disjuncture with how we approach and understand our core values to begin a ready illustration can be found in a recent interrogation of the core values list wherein some were found to be fundamental some subordinate and some questionable anderson  at the very top of this pyramid is access about as fundamental as a library principle can get which then colored two other fundamental values intellectual freedom they are access confidentiality and privacy democracy diversity education and lifelong learning intellectual freedom preservation the public good professionalism service and social responsibility in turn they are linked to professional ethics and competencies ala   this is not just flotsam from the internet it is sponsored by a venerable and important publication in the field and written by an administrator of an arl library such sponsored web platforms when treated as neutral spaces for exchange present substantive problems for the field see john buschmans letter to library journal library journal supports the annoyed librarian but ends criticas anime world blog january   httpuchiha readmeblogspotcom john buschmans letter to libraryhtml library quarterly information community policy vol  no  pp    by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
  the library quarterlyhow and why we impose structure on access and service a library without service is nothing but a collection of documents sitting in a building anderson  subordinate values then feed into this access driven view confidentiality and privacy protects intellectual freedom diversity helps ensure equitable access professionalism should characterize our services and preservation ensures continued access anderson  the questionable remaining core values are certainly not bad or wrong in and of themselves but troublesome in    their real world application    or in conflict with other values education and lifelong learning are potentially wasteful and expensive to support mere leisure democracy is support for one particular political and social philosophy and prejudicial to antidemocratic users social responsibility is unworkable amid diversity of opinion and the public good is purely subjective    a truly diverse profession will inevitably disagree on what best serves the public good anderson  professional tropes andersons  interrogation is simply a selection from what ala states about a value and then a hierarchical schematization and it serves here as a stand in for a broader pattern of how we have understoodand still understand and expressour core values in so doing the interrogation projects updated versions of two very old tropes of librarianship  trope  useful knowledge and the information paradigm wiegand  documents the longstanding librarian bias for useful knowledgethat is books and information relevant to paid work and public affairs and the correlative educational connection of the library to economic opportunity as a result librarianship was long characterized as relentlessly practical and crudely positivist by default the librarian appeared to stand alone in the simplicity of his pragmatism a rationalization of each immediate technical process by itself was challenge enough harris   this bias fed a valorization of new information technologies which led to projections of the demise of libraries and prioritized the information that capitalism thought useful by making it all more accessible wiegand    trope  neutrality if a bias for useful knowledge led to our technologically mediated information paradigm this in turn reinforced neutrality the idea of technology as a merely neutral tool for access to information dovetailed with the idea of a rational unbiased actor in the library profession presented as an act of service to patrons jaeger et al   that avoided controversy and neutrally promoted intellectual freedom the problems of neutralityincluding its apolitical almost amoral pallidnessand the very real difficulties in actually achieving it in a meaningful way versus striking a neutral pose for effect or convenience are legion jaeger et al  but it is prominent nonetheless
core values bad faith and democracy  it isnt difficult to see in the core values schema above how these tropes are currently played out essentially access has been valorized to characterize and color some core values and to question others this is a vision of technologically mediated neutral access to useful versus wasteful leisure information resources values entailing disagreement or diversity of opinion defined as controversial and therefore tout court nonneutral and off limits are relegated to the realm of the subjective unrealistic or unattainableand thus could not be core values it is in short a technocratic and neoliberal vision of librarianships core values buschman a  november   highlighted the problems with this approach and the need for clarification the recent campaign and electionand libraries despite fashionable posturing about choices among tweedledum and tweedledee elections have consequences november  and the campaign that preceded itpresents disturbing implications at cross purposes with all but the most casuistic reading of the fields values offering library services and collections that respect the dignity of women people of color diverse religions and ethnicities the poor and diversity of public exchange will take place in a different environment as a result of the discourse ofand enabled bythis campaign and the aftermath of the election the resulting policy environment will likely emphasize some combination of higher income tax cuts to stimulate investment privatization of public services environmental deregulation a deemphasis of climate change changes to the social safety net health care insurance family leave social security and financial deregulation krugman a b it is difficult to see how a technocratic and neoliberal vision of librarianships core values could meaningfully address library users needs within this environment access means very little to people who are already economically struggling for a foothold or who have had a fundamental piece of their personhood now made controversial burns haberman and parker  dickerson  fausset blinder and eligon  goldstein  krugman b lee and quealy  reilly  shalby  to circle back to the core values interrogation the neat schema has been reshuffled questionable fundamental and subordinate values are now swept up together in the aftermath of november   diversity social responsibility privacy the public good and intellectual freedom borchers  are now very much subject to a diversity of opinion and thus are all controversial or nonneutral and should not be core by the logic of the interrogation and librarianships tropes as an explanation or an identification of the essential qualities of librarianships core values this approach has grave limitations the problem is that the core values list is treated as a mere grouping of words into which any number of meanings can be read and onto which any given hierarchy can be imposed ignoring the values context there are reasons why this list was chosen as core if one bothers to read even a bit of the nonboldface text a context emerges words phrases and clauses such

core values bad faith and democracy  we now arrive at why november   and the campaign that preceded it are so very disturbing for the field they have so enshrined untruthliesthat oxford dictionaries named post truth its word of the year wang  the examples beyond this meager selection are legion cillizza  dale and talaga  kessler  lauter  new york times editorial board   that thousands of muslims in new jersey celebrated the fall of the twin towers on   that real unemployment was  in   that ted cruzs father was linked to lee harvey oswald  that president obama was not legitimately a citizen  that the obama administration supported terror groups  that a reporters disability was not mimicked and mocked  that denigrating comments were not made about women  that the outcome was a popular vote landslide for the electoral college winner this went so far that a vice presidential candidate flatly denied a number of statements recorded tweeted or written by his presidential candidateincluding the signature campaign policy of deporting immigrants cohen  fake news has become both standard and a serious problem for journalists lynch and many supporters of the electoral college winner simply dont care ignatius  sullivan  facts dont sway librarianship why bad faith beyond the self serving worries of the media about these developments they present a fundamental challenge to the values of librarianship they call for the clarification of our values and a reckoning for bad faith self deception inauthenticity evading responsibility hypocrisy in conduct or unreasonable interpretations of evidence martin  to give one example much fact checking was finally done during the recent election by the media after long enabling false and outrageous claims to capture audiences and this would seem to dovetail well with the commonly understood values and practices of librarianship rather it is a version of our values filtered through our tropes and the interrogation fact checking tends to imply mere access a neutral true false dichotomy that denatures and decontextualizes what is being checked it implies an instrumental application of rules and searches to the fact or nonfact at hand it implies a balance between the sides of an issue and the facts all of this is greatly enhanced by the media and the web making lies eg the muslim celebration of  harmless or urban legends buschman b thus a context posited by fact checking is so demonstrably false that library instrumentality and neutrality in this case would serve to mask the full meaning of verified and verifiable fact or falsehood as the media did during most of the campaign the sides were nowhere near equal on the trueuntrue spectrum to imply
  the library quarterlya side or a spectrum at all is itself misleading in light of november   a neoliberal instrumental and neutral understanding of our core values constitutes bad faith unresponsive to the scale and nature of events but the situation goes much further in the teeth of so much untruth and the resulting policy trajectories that cuts away at the goals of our core values into the postelection environment stepped the ala in the form of a press release posted in error that shows how libraries support policy priorities of the new administration another press release offered expertise and resources to the incoming administration in finding common policy ground there a nonretraction and explanation appeared approximately a week later that expressed regret about the way the original press release was publicized and received documents were taken down from the web the image of the document was captured and reposted and a retraction of the original press release was issued in the end with a statement of the need to fight to advance our core values after another week and a continuing storm of protest in the process the neoliberal and corporate nature and structure of the ala was laid bare in the form of differences in interests policy direction and process between a permanent professional staff and executive structure a washington dc government relations lobbying office and the independence of both from elected leadership who ostensibly set policy in a putatively democratic professional association the bad faith in the form of the number of core values violated access democracy preservation intellectual freedom professionalism the public good diversity by the very association that promulgated them during this whole process was dizzying and it was done all in the name of logrolling with a new administration the election of which has done so much to further undercut core values of librarianship and democracy conclusion democracy and november   habermas  has told us weve been on this path for some time now we are witnessing an increasing substitution of images for words and also that inter mingling of categories such as advertising politics entertainment and information    promoting the neon lit re  this passage links to copies of rescinded documents and subsequent noted facts open letter to ala president julie todaro re recent ala statements librarian in black blog november   httplibrarianinblacknet librarianinblackalastatements ala offers expertise resources to incoming administration and congress press release wayback machine internet archive httpswebarchiveorgwebhttpwwwalaorgnewspress releasesala offers expertise resources incoming administration and congress julie b todaro a message to members american libraries november   httpsamericanlibrariesmagazineorgblogsthe scoopa message to members ala president responds to member concerns on new administration press release american library association december   httpwwwalaorgnewspress releasesala president responds member concerns new administration ala president responds to concerns from members about press release regarding library priorities and the new administration press release american library association november   httpwwwalaorg newspress releasesala president responds concerns members about press release regarding library rory litwin the ala washington office press releases and todaros monday morning misdirection notmyala library juice blog november   httplibraryjuicepresscomblogp
