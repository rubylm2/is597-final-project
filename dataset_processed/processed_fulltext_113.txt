introduction to library science an attempt masanobu fujikawa at the outset i feel i have to admit that any discussion of what should constitute a course in  ntroduction to library science is bound to develop into the issue of what is library science nevertheless unless we have a blueprint of some sort on which the structure of library science is shown however sketchy it may be it is difficult to develop our study and discussion of curricula courses and units in the field of education for librarianship any study of a specific subject requires a definition of its range and this definition being concise and objective fails to give a clear image though at the same time it seems to ease the mind of those engaged in the study because it provides more freedom of interpretation can we then define library science in terms of the practices of libraries in action librarianship is not infrequently referred to as a profession based upon experiences and skills in libraries and it has been commonly understood that education for librarianship should aim principally at the preparation of library personnel for library work but when we find rather diverse approaches to the introductory part of the librarianship we can not help wondering if there has been any agreed upon method of initiating students into our field a method based upon a clear definition of library science in any other branches of organized human knowledge principles and methods were developed from experiences they were extracted out of the facts experienced and not a little effort was directed towards the establishment of methods applicable to their fields scholars and researchers have tried different methodologies in order to organize facts into a certain acceptable order it is also obvious from abundant evidence in the field of library science that painstaking and patient efforts 
introduction to library science an attempt along the same line have been made by our predecessors and colleagues however practical demands from libraries have been so urgent that they have worked a kind of barrier to the development of a sound theoretical approach to our field this makes it more difficult to maintain critical judgment of our educational program it certainly is true that there is a vast diversity in library phenomena because of their history their varying types functions and size their governing bodies their clientele as well as because of the techniques they employ it seems very difficult to define the range of the object of library science but this is true of any science the history of libraries covers a period no shorter than any other branch of science so we cannot complain that we have not had enough time to organize our observations and thinking and if we feel the lack of an adequate method or rather methodology by which we shall be able to achieve a certain common ground in analyzing and organizing library phenomena this lack must be met by those concerned with research and education in our field the following is a mere outline of a course introduction to library science for undergraduate students in the second year of college or third year students enrolled in the japan library school who have completed the ba course selection of topics is influenced by the fact that the class meets once a week for  minutes during the whole academic year these topics are also related to the contents of other courses offered in the professional two year program it should be noted that the following outline represents my personal opinion rather than that of the faculty of the japan library school or any other group of japanese librarians any organization of knowledge must necessarily employ two ways of examining objects namely deductive and inductive methods though the weight of each differs from one science to another in what follows i have tried to deduce the existing concept of library phenomena and at the same time to provide students with an opportunity to observe the present situation and try to find a new approach through the inductive method while they are enrolled in our school first let us admit that in any learning whether it be scientific or aesthetic one has to consider the faculty of thinking as peculiar to the human race this thinking faculty is stimulated by achievements of others and the stimulation is given through communicative activities of one sort or another since man has the desire to express his ideas it is very natural that he seeks every available or conceivable means of expression and if his means of expression is understood by his asso
journal of education for librarianship dates it opens the way for communication this process constitutes one unity and its elements cannot be separated there have been quite a few methods and media for communication and recording is one of the most significant methods among them the one most closely related to the idea of library once man mastered the technique of recording and found that it was a very convenient means of communication with his contemporaries and with those who came later it was very natural to continue to produce recordings whenever necessary since the act of recording means to keep what should be communicated in a form and is addressed to somebody physically outside him admitting that he himself could be the addressee there will be a physical body of recorded materials meanwhile the addressee or the receiver of records may want to keep some of them longer because he may find lasting value in them he may keep all records available or addressed to him or may discriminate or select them for further keeping this act leads easily to the act of collecting records the collecting activity may vary by who collects what in which manner for what purpose whatever shape the activity may take collecting activity presumes future use if one does not expect the future use of recorded materials or any form of materials for that matter think of the collecting activity of museums one will not start collecting in anticipating future use one has to preserve recordings and the act of preserving varies by various elements eg for whom how and where since preservation assumes use when the body of materials grows larger and it is apt to be so when time goes by one may have to try to find some means which enables him to use preserved items more effectively the effective use of materials urges one to think of the way of arranging storing and keeping records of them secondary recording  when the collection becomes still larger or more specialized in its nature some auxiliary means will be necessary in the use of the materials interpreters of them or particular tools and aids which will provide easier access to what is collected and preserved will be employed in due course as the body of collected materials becomes more bulky and its constituents more complex some kind of direction or policy is required to keep it in desirable condition and order as well as to decide who takes responsibility for it the direction or policy should clarify factors relating to materials such as those who handle them those who use them places to keep them ways and means to promote their use etc in the course of time one will feel more secure and encouraged if one 
introduction to library science an attempt finds persons or organizations facing similar problems and may wish to make contact to them on the other hand as a collection grows its users may grow in number or more concentrated use may be expected because growth of the collection is commonly caused by the increased power of a collector increase in those who produce recordings or increase of the rate of producing records in some specific areas and to the responsibilities involved with acquiring arranging and serving materials are added that of rendering assistance and advice to users being provided with materials needed tools to locate them space or facilities to make better use of them services to meet needs all of these based on a certain well planned policy users will find it easier to locate materials they want through wise use of these recorded materials users may create something new something of scientific significance or of aesthetic value the process of this creative activity which is more aptly called research activity in the scientific field must be well understood by those whose role is to render service for the progress of human intellectual and creative activities to have a better understanding of what has been mentioned above it is necessary to trace the mode of thinking in the past and that of today in various areas of human activities and to have a perspective of our future in terms of the way people approach their aims thus the discussion comes back to the starting point this old method of setting up a circle to indicate growth of any organism i dared to adopt simply because i felt it could be understood more easily by those who had just come into our field the schematic illustration reproduced below shows graphically the more detailed description given on the following pages ix creative activity  i thinking  ii communication i i i i i iii recording i i i i viii assistance to readers iv collecting i i i i vii administration  vi organization  v preserving for effective use
