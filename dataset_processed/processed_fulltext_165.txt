us government information policy kathleen eisenbeis the purpose of this article is to provide an understanding of the federal information policy some definitions of that policy will be provided along with an idea of the range of issues being covered some of the current actors and policy initiatives are highlighted as are suggestions of ways faculty can participate in the policy process  the basics of u s government information policy originally i had intended to raise the question of whether we have a federal information policy a year ago i would have argued that what we have is merely a policy for the efficient management of government information but even though this is partly true it only represents a narrow perspective that goes nowhere in the strictest sense we also have a policy if nothing is done i have decided to begin by presenting a new mental image a model if you will for federal information policy for those who may not be as familiar with the subject as some of us foolish enough to dwell on it i can assure you that the references made to it have not always been positive we struggle with an image problem government information policy is likened to mud and jello and described as nasty messy confusing and ambiguous so clear your mind or flush it as the topic may warrant and let us begin anew i envision federal information policy as a crystal this crystal is threedimensional with multiple facets it is a bright and shining object of fascination comprised of many sides and reflects a spectrum of color as it turns to the observer what one sees depends on where one stands no one perspective is any better or worse than the other but the beauty is only evident in the light so too is information policy comprised of many aspects many issues that must be seen as parts of a whole what kathleen eisenbeis is a doctoral student and university fellow graduate school of library and information science university of texas austin tx    volume  number 
u s government information policy perspective one has will determine what face of the issue one sees  what colors the policy it is a complex image  but rather than be discouraged or frightened away by the complexity recognize that there is power in the value of the resource the value of information comes from its use and the policies that govern its use will shape a national treasure  the crystal is a powerful image to keep in mind we as information professionals have always protected the public right to information let us begin to rethink the opportunities we have for contributing to the development of the federal information policy definitions generally the term policy is used to designate the behavior of some actor or group of actors in a given area of activity added to this are elements of purposive action directed toward some goal or goals or people doing something to deal with a problem or matter of concern in information policy we can assume that the broad area of concern is information simple enough not quite the origins of concern in federal information policy have been traced back to the mid thirties as cited in  milestones in the evolution of information policy issues compiled as part of the  rockefeller report national information policy the focus was communication in the next two decades the focus was scientific information and in the seventies libraries and information networks today the focus is information technology and the effective management of government information resources all these streams have converged into information policy what kathleen heim refers to as   catch all term   heim cites an essay by eileen trauth that calls for an integrative approach to information policy research in which us information policy is characterized as decentralized and implicit in nature consisting of a collection of laws precedents expectations and social norms which are generally autonomous and have emanated from diverse sources robert lee chartrand of congressional research service calls the struggle to define the term an unflagging area of discussion   he often cites the  report to the president by the domestic council committee on the right of privacy popularly referred to as the rockefeller report as now classic  and explains that although there are many different connotations all have one thing in common they deal with the policies that govern the way information affects society the report describes a common family of interdependent and intersecting interest information communication information technology information economics information privacy information systems information confidentiality information science information networks and information management the congressional research service is now compiling an annual review of the bills and resolutions concerned with information policy and fall

u s government information policy may even welcome assistance in developing user studies agencies have been given a mandate by omb to make maximum use of information technologies but little assistance on how this is to be accomplished information systems are being developed in many agencies by wellintentioned bureaucrats seeking to accomplish their information dissemination mission studies evaluating the impact of new information systems on the user community will be critical to future policy development as heim has already suggested let us no longer be blind to the problems of the agencies and decisionmakers  but find research that can be transformed into results institutions and school of library and information science should be adding the study of federal information policy to the curriculum although few programs will have the flexibility to add an entire course a lecture or series of lectures should be integrated federal information policy issues can relate to library administration bibliographic control information systems online database searching reference services literature of science and obviously government documents courses faculty in other departments may already be involved in research or be serving as members of advisory committees and could benefit from libraryinformation science faculty members knowledge they will not be knocking on library school doors they must be sought out cooperative research projects will only expand libraryinformation science methodologies and provide more visibility for the discipline why are the computer science engineers receiving the contracts for information use studies the opportunities are there what is now called federal information policy may not be everything desired but many of the critical issues are still largely questions that need attention before others who are closer to the policymakers and farther from the users have answered them for the libraryinformation science field nothing can take the place of thousands of librarians who understand and work effectively within the political system to advocate on behalf of the user better access to the riches of the world information  references and notes   the national commission on libraries and information science published the report by the domestic council committee on the right of privacy nelson a rockefeller chair national information policy washington dc govt print off  the tables entitled milestones  appear between pages  and     heim k information policy and the profession the information society    chartrand r l policy imperatives in the information age òò bulletin llb reb mar   ibid  ibid  hernon p  and mcclure c r  federal information policies in the  conflicts and issues norwood nj ablex  p  the criteria defined for selecting which of the issues were most significant excluding those related to privacy and civil liberties are  frequency with which the issues were mentioned in the readings examined  breadth of time over which the issue has retained attention and  potential for producing significant changes in the responsibilities of fedfall
