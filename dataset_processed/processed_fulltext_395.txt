the vatican library  collection of this sort concerning the roman patriciate families to come to the vatican the value of these archives becomes apparent when one considers that in them are collected a large portion of the papers having to do with the activities of the cardinals bishops nuncios and other ecclesiastical dignitaries papers dealing with the history of the church which emanated from ecclesiastical authorities in the exercise of their functions some of which came naturally to complete the documents already in the vatican archives and library and heavy bundles from the office of the santa sede in i leo xiii bought the archives and the library of the borghese committing the former to the vatican archives and the latter to the vatican library another part of these archives came three years later from the family in i the barberini library  i with all its bookcases was transferred to the vatican library this library contains  printed books and i manuscripts in addition to a collection of archives recently enriched by the gift of the sciarra papers in ii the precious rossi library came into the vatican in  the italian government gave the chigi library to the pope  incunabula  printed books and  manuscripts including a collection of archives the private archives have remained with the family in  the widow marchesa ferrajoli gave the library of her family ioo manuscripts and oooo printed volumes among which are many works of french spanish and english literature in  the archives of the prince ruspoli were deposited in the vatican archives in march i the pontificate received a generous gift from an american catholic mr louis mendelssohn who acquired for the pope the famous portrait of clement ix by maratta sacred relics of that pope and the archives of the rospigliosi house partially destroyed by fire with a great part of the library to complete the list of important recent accessions we will record that in march i the croci family gave to the holy father and thus to the vatican library the voluminous collec

 the library quarterly department mr martel to come to rome but also by giving a complete collection of its printed cards and by continuing to furnish them thus providing a depository catalog it also furnished the vatican catalog with cards for those of our books of which they possessed copies and which they had cataloged the use of library of congress cards was quickly adopted by the vatican library so that dr bishop was able to write i regard this agreement on cataloging principles as an international undertaking of great importance which will advance the practice of international cataloging at least fifty years it was a just prediction for the use and indeed only the presence of the american cards in the vatican library has incited many librarians to reform their own systems to bring them up to date and especially to examine themselves in an unprejudiced manner with the reorganization thus begun a center for the diffusion of systems and ideas has been created at rome and an intellectual convergence has been brought about capable of promoting and advancing that spiritual intent by which carnegie was moved from i to  three more assistants at the vatican library came to the united states to study library science at the university of michigan they were dr riccardo matta dr giuseppe graglia and dr nello vian the recataloging manuscriptsin the actual methods of cataloging the manuscripts a collection numbering about oooo little or nothing has been changed for more than thirty years a printed catalog manageable in form and accurate in content has been in the process of compilation the work has progressed rapidly during the past few years under the encouragement given by a pontiff who having been a librarian himself understands the needs of a library like that of the vatican the aid given by the carnegie endowment is also partly responsible for the progress twenty volumes have been published in which are described  ibid i  p i

 the library quarterly but also subjects and data which inform the searcher of the persons and the particular and general arguments to which the writings thus cataloged refer author cards are made whenever an author is known or can be identified title cards whenever the writer is anonymous and the title is given in the manuscript or an edition of it or can be supplied by scientific research subject and material cards which have the entry words in capital letters so that they may be quickly distinguished from the others are usually made for every unedited work and for edited works only when it seems strictly necessary for works which are both anonymous and unedited still another card is made giving the incipit in order to aid in the eventual identification of the work and in the researches of the catalogers themselves cross reference cards tie the entire collection together at the proper points the basic elements contained in the cards have been determined by an analytic examination of the writings scientifically conducted and subject and material cards are prepared according to criteria which aim at combining the necessary precision with whatever practicability in description and classification will best answer the needs of the students this results in a fulness of entries which are distributed and grouped so as to throw into relief on cursory examination organic series of data which would otherwise be difficult to discover the language in which the manuscripts are described in the catalogs is latin which is the tongue best understood by scholars of all countries in the index however it has seemed advisable to give the subjects in italian to harmonize with the practice in the catalog of printed books incunabulafor the incunabula about seven thousand there exists a general alphabetic catalog typewritten on cards in which are given all the data for their identification three duplicate cards have been made for each entry one of which goes to the public catalog one to the official catalog and the third to a special catalog of incunabula an accurate technical description of each incunabulum has been made by a competent cataloger rev tommaso accurti

 the library quarterly brussels r henriquez i have in several points followed the rules of the vatican the dictionary catalog is on cards following the pattern and form of those of the library of congress so that every american who consults it soon remarks that it looks very familiar the cards are printed when it is discovered from the depository catalog that the book has been cataloged at washington the vatican requests the cards from the library of congress otherwise it prints them itself the subject headings of the secondary cards as well as the bibliographic descriptions are in the italian language the subject headings however are almost all taken from the subject headings published by the library of congress and translated into italian i have written an article concerning the criteria used in this translation subject headings in the vatican library for special libraries vol xxv no  march  americans using the catalog find no difficulty in retranslating these headings into english along with the dictionary catalog there is being compiled a classified catalog arranged according to the library of congress classification all the cards have one and sometimes two classifications constituting a language which needs no translation the reading public has made good use of the dictionary catalog it is only beginning with some hesitation to approach the classified catalog a more unusual tool it is needless to say that the adoption of these systems of cataloging has aroused along with enthusiasm and approval some criticism and disapproval the importance of the collaboration of libraries and the exchange of their products in the form of uniform catalogs is not yet evident to all there are still some readers who do not realize the added ease which our cards bring to research and who are affected by a nostalgia for the difficulties imposed by the old catalogs considered as a testing ground for courage as though difficulties in research were lacking the author catalog of printed books has been completed as soon as the handwritten cards have been replaced by printed
the vatican library ii cards the author catalog will be transformed into a dictionary catalog it should be noted that the handwritten cards are in two forms and that they are in two sets of card cases the most recent ones in the same form as the printed cards arranged in metal cases which are to become the catalog cases for the dictionary catalog and the older cards collected in wooden boxes which have also been subjected to rearrangement by some sisters of the franciscan missionaries of mary who have collaborated gratuitously in the revision they have been working in their mother house checking the entries according to the criteria lately adopted recopying the small cards of the barberini collection collecting on a single card the entries for the various copies of a work etc the books in the sala di consultazione reference library are all entered in the new card cases a good portion of them have been recataloged according to the new rules and almost all the cards which have been printed are for these books the work is slow because the personnel is limited the five catalogers trained in america who are editing the cards for the press are assisted to a certain extent by four others who are constantly interrupted in this task by other duties in the library there are in all eleven persons engaged in making both the definitive and the provisional cards certainly few enough for a large library and for work of high accuracy painstaking work is required for example in the establishment of the biographical dates of all persons whose names are used as entries either main or secondary in this work all available sources are utilized and in addition letters are written to persons and institutions in every country a task which is partly compensated for by the volumes which authors offer to send immediately upon receiving our request in order that they may have all their works present in the vatican cards have been printed since i and are sold at the price of l  each to associated libraries table i presents a list of the numbers of cards printed in past years with the cost for each year and the total cost the cards are sent in packages of about

the vatican library  palace of nicholas v and alexander vi with the pavilion or belvedere of innocent viii on december  i the beginning of his sacred jubilee the holy father opened the first section of this new library this was the lower part built in the old stables this enormous space has been divided into three stories by marble floors and filled with new metal stacks constructed in the united states by an organization specializing in library equipment snead  co of new jersey and put in place by italian workmen under the direction of an engineer from the manufacturing company the stacks are  meters high permitting access to the books without the need of ladders or steps the adjustable shelves allow the graduation of the spaces according to the heights of the books the installation of electric light in metal tubes to prevent short circuits makes the space bright as day and there is additional light from large windows electric interrupters are provided with time attachments which automatically cut off the current after five minutes much to the assistance of the personnel who may suffer from absent mindedness a defect it is reported not uncommon among students a powerful ventilator transmits the air through the whole space automatically tempering the air in order to protect the leather bindings which would suffer as much from an excess of dryness as from an excess of humidity three stairways and an otis elevator connect the three floors of the stacks at the same time as this new stack was opened the new entrance to the library with its artistic stone staircase was inaugurated in the cortile del belvedere two stone murals at the foot of the staircase celebrate the bibliographic enlargement of the library during the first seven years of the pontificate of pius xi represented for example by the accession of the chigiana of the ferrajoli library of the caprotti oriental manuscripts of the library of mgr petit etc the new stairway and above all the modern stack installation give a most modern appearance to the oldest library in europe to this first section the holy father added a second still larger one occupying the floor above where the mosaic factory was
i the library quarterly located but greater in length to the end of the cortile di s damaso the mosaic factory was established by sixtus v to provide mosaics needed in the basilica di s pietro then in construction and after various peregrinations took that place in i under leo xii the mosaic factory was transferred to another location behind the old seminario minore vaticano the large windows on the cortile del belvedere were reopened as far as was practicable in the thickness of the bramantesque walls toward the east in this way the architectural compactness which resembles a bastion of a fortress was restored uninterrupted except for the great entrance arch which was re embellished and the overhanging balcony the entrance to which has been enlarged on the parapet of this balcony a large stone will commemorate this further work of pius xi throughout the space which extends over the first stacks the entrance arch and another thirty meters metal uprights of stacks have been installed they are divided into three stories with floors of carrara marble and are connected not only by means of the common elevator but also by five stairways of iron and marble a stairway in the center and the entrance elevator provide communication with the part beneath in the large room which extends along the wing of the building as far as the adjacent cortile di s damaso stacks have been placed along the inside wall divided into three stories with two iron galleries and set aside for the cabinet of engravings and for the cicognara library this arrangement has been adopted to avoid invading the floor adorned with beautiful old mosaics another adjoining room is reserved for the care of the geographical maps next to the windows which open onto the balcony over the entrance arch of the cortile del belvedere and on the first floor of the new part which is the fourth floor of the biblioteca nuova is the doorway to the numismatic cabinet or medal collection belonging to the vatican library by way of this room and the cabinet of engravings there is access to a room overlooking the cortile del triangolo which houses the caetani archives
the vatican library i as to the new section of the stacks the principal part of these occupies a space  meters long  meters wide and  meters high and contains ioooo meters of shelves arranged in  ranges i meters high and of a collective weight of  tons of steel twenty five rows of the stacks on the fourth floor have been provided with grills and closed off with a special door for the most valuable books of the riserva and for the incunabula the electric installation in this section is even more modern than that in the one beneath it is in the form of reflecting lamps so that illumination is secured by three hundred electric lights regulated by interrupters with wires conducted in tubes which guarantee perfect insulation against fire the ventilator located on the second floor takes the air already dried and humidified from the stacks underneath and distributes it through the three floors the new stacks have a capacity of ooo volumes the new sala di consultazione at the close of   in the middle of this work of transformation there was a most unfortunate accident december  at four thirty olock an hour in which fortunately there were few persons remaining there was a collapse of the above mentioned old wing the library of sixtus v two pillars of the salone sistino with the corresponding portion of the sala di consultazione beneath were destroyed crushing four workmen who were working on the ground floor and knocking down a young collaborator dr marco vattasso who had been hired only a few days before in the crash some treasures were overturned among which were eight manuscripts from the salone sistino and about fifteen thousand volumes from the sala di consultazione the rescue work was undertaken immediately the victims and the books were freed the holy father greatly affected especially by the loss of human life gave immediate orders to begin the reconstruction of the building out of fifteen thousand volumes only about fifty were so badly damaged as to be beyond
i the library quarterly repair the rest remained intact or were capable of repair the manuscripts were all restored in order that the students should not be hindered in their work the books in the sala di consultazione were quickly put in order and assembled on the shelves of the biblioteca nuova which had just been put in the place of the mosaic factory on the morning of december  all was in order and on january  when the library was formally opened to the public the students found the printed books and manuscripts at their disposal and in order the ruined frescoes on the ceilings of the salone sistino were reproduced with scrupulous exactness according to the originals so that in april  the large court was reopened to the public in all its splendor of color and light nothing was missing except one precious cup of malachite given by the czar and the baptismal font of the son of napoleon iii which had been irreparably shattered and so on october  i after a private visit from the holy father the sala di consultazione completely restored after the disaster was reopened to the public the entrance to the library was again placed on the cortile del belvedere the restoration of the sala di consultazione is now complete in vivid richness reproduced with fidelity and in luminousness the room stands as beautiful and imposing as before the greater illumination comes from the opening of a large window in the arch facing on the cortile del belvedere in accordance with bramante plan for the complete restoration of the original architectural design of the court the high and wide cornices of the three buildings to the east west and north had been partly walled in in successive epochs and reduced to portholes for telescopes on the ground floor where some are still remaining or to normal rectangular windows pius x had already opened almost all those on the first floor on the east in order to provide light for the pinacoteca pius xi retaking the initiative resolved in i to open likewise those on the other two sides and the same year began to open those in the old stables now transformed into the storage room for printed books and in i he made an effort to do the same for those in the sala di
the vatican library  consultazione it was this which required the change in the shelving which has now been effected as a matter of fact to speak of the sala di consultazione is to use a somewhat misleading expression because in effect the sala di consultazione consists of not one but three rooms the two larger of which are parallel and intercommunicating receiving light from the cortile del belvedere and the cortile della biblioteca now called the stamperia respectively a portion of the third and smallest overlooks the cortile del belvedere the rest connects with the archives in saying that the sala di consultazione is well lighted one means to speak particularly of the first assembly hall flooded with light from seven enormous windows now opened the improved lighting is also due to the fact that in two of the parallel halls the oblique shelving which had divided them into three sections has disappeared so that now they present themselves in their entire length standing out in relief from the graceful galleries of the new shelves and in the first room from the rows of twenty three beautiful student desks each one with four sections placed in orderly fashion along the entire length of the room the students are given as much convenience and space as they formerly enjoyed the new stacks are the most noteworthy part of the furnishings which were all completely renovated according to the most modern technique the installation was the work of snead  company these iron stacks covered over with a pure green bronze with movable shelves which can be adjusted within half inch limits are placed next to the outside walls between the windows along the two inside walls the stacks instead of being twice as high are divided into half their height by a graceful and decorative gallery also of bronzed iron provided with a balustrade with small columns joining to make squares for colored glass these are provided with reading desks fastened to the gallery to permit the immediate and rapid consultation of books with this division these higher stacks result in normal height so that any person of average stature is able to reach the volume
i  the library quarterly he needs without the aid of stools and cumbersome and creaking ladders in the two larger rooms which are separated by a wall there are displayed two parallel galleries which communicate with each other across the six spacious openings of the passages between the two rooms these double stacks cover the entire height of the walls in the next room the gallery next to the entrance is detached along the inside wall and passes across as far as the outside wall where there is displayed in the space the first group of sculpturing which covers likewise the second row of the stacks moreover in order to conserve space the shelving along the length of the inside wall is not placed directly back to the wall as in the corresponding wall inclosing the other room but is arranged in the form of a comb with projections which extend about two meters out into the room ie for each two sections of the shelving in the main floor and about one meter ie for each separate section in the gallery this arrangement has permitted this part of the gallery to be made much longer there is access to the gallery by way of two staircases placed at either end of the second hall or by means of the large otis elevator which connects the inclosure underneath where in november the catalogers the secretary and the accession department with their necessary reference equipment were transferred the elevators serves also to convey the book trucks which facilitate the distribution of the books the center space in the second room is not filled with study desks but with sections of the old and new catalog placed in ten handsome metal files furnished by forges of strassburg the upper part of these files is provided with trays for cards six rows per case and fourteen trays in a row these files will later be used for the general catalog which as we have said is in process of revision the old card catalog in wooden trays is placed in the lower part of the same cases on movable stands and corresponds alphabetically with the new catalog so that the searcher who is looking for the work of a particular author can find it without having to move either in the new general catalog in the old
the vatican library i catalog or in the catalogs of the british museum of the bibijotheque nationale or in the gesamtkatalog of the prussian libraries since these catalogs are also placed with the same alphabetical arrangement on the shelves under the wooden trays at the present time the new cases are only partly occupied by the cards the two upper rows of cases have been left empty in all the sections these will be filled gradually as the recataloging proceeds and the old cards of the wooden trays are replaced with the new so that in time these latter will disappear completely in the meantime some metal cases of the same length but of lesser depth and height provided with movable metal shelves have been placed between one section and another to maintain the alphabetical continuity between the card catalogs and the printed catalogs of the foreign libraries and to provide space for the oversize volumes a good number of the wooden trays of the old catalog have been placed in the upper part of these while the lower part is used to hold volumes of the printed catalogs or oversize volumes those higher than  cm belonging to adjacent sections in the regular shelving these cases alternating with the card catalog cases serve also as tables upon which the trays of the catalog and the printed catalogs can be placed for consultation in the third room the arrangement of the bookshelves is repeated in the same design as in the other rooms that is to say they are single for a certain space and double with a gallery for a longer space an innovation in the reconstruction of the biblioteca di consultazione is the electrical installation made in accordance with the most modern theories of fire protection with a rich arrangement of lamps in order to assure proper illumination even in the northern part where the natural lighting is not always sufficient all the bookshelves are provided with lamps which in the second hall are automatically extinguished with a clocklike device similar to that functioning for the stacks in the new storeroom for the printed books after five minutes of illumination and in the first room an electrical outlet has been placed on the floor at the foot of each study table eventually to provide il
