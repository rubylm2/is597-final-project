introduction archival studies is one of the most rapidly expanding interdisciplinary and multimethodological areas of research within ischools as well as library and information science lis programs in north america and the same phenomenon is occurring in comparable schools around the globe  beginning with a brief preamble on the development and maturation of professional archival education in the united states this article highlights the unprecedented volume and richness of scholarship in archival studies that is now emanating from these programs it posits however that while archival studies research has been flourishing within boundarycrossing ischools archival education within both ischool and library and information science programs still focuses too narrowly on the traditional paradigmatic aspects of archival science ie the professional canon of theory and practice as such it fails to engage wider scholarship in ways that might help to broaden and pluralize the construction of archival education and practice and perhaps by example of the information fields more generally drawing upon the findings and recommendations of two recent research projects we suggest ways in which archival educationboth professional and researchtogether with pedagogy ie how educational content is conveyed and internalized can play a central role in promoting more reflexive and inclusive archival ideas practices and research we argue that such reflexivity and inclusivity also encourage beneficial interactions with those in other academic and professional fields with shared interests or concerns the article concludes with a brief discussion of three current educational initiatives that are seeking to address some of these considerations background on the development and nature of archival education and research within us library and information programs the archival profession developed comparatively later in the united states than the library profession and considerably later than the archival profession in europe where formal archival education began as early as the late eighteenth century in bologna naples and then in  most notably at the école des chartes in paris the development of a distinct professional archival field in the united states only began in earnest after the  founding of the national archives and the establishment in  of the society of american archivists as an outgrowth of the american historical association which itself was not founded until  while the need for some form of archival education and training in the united states was acknowledged from the late nineteenth century onward there has been continuous debate among both archivists and historians about the appropriate location nature and duration of that education in  solon justus buck publications director for the national archives taught the nations first archival administration course at columbia universitys library school in the following year he cotaught a similar course for american universitys department of history with ernst posner a former senior archivist with the prussian privy state archives who had recently emigrated to the united states after being removed from his position in germany because of his jewish heritage in  when buck became the second archivist of the united states posner took over teaching the course for american university on his own joining the faculty of american university and eventually becoming dean the american university program became the first formal ongoing graduate archival education in the united states  in  however at the annual meeting of the society of american archivists in salt lake city theodore schellenberg assistant archivist at the national archives and the man who would come to be viewed as the father of american archival theory called for separate archival training courses incorporating archival techniques and principles to be taught within library schools in  he taught at the archives institute hosted by the library school of the university of texas at austin thus initiating what was to become a half century of entrenched professional debate over whether archival science or archival administration should best be taught as a component of history or public history programs or of library and information science  either way archival education was taught as an ancillary and practiceoriented area of the larger field within which it was housed as both the terms administration and science might indicate and really only came into its own as a field of education and research in the s prior to the s historytrained archivists dominated the archival profession since that time graduates from archival education programs located within library and information science and more recently ischools and information studies programs have accounted for the largest numbers of entrants into the archival profession with this change has come a new discussion about the nature and purpose of archival education should archival education focus on archival science which studies the characteristics of records in their social and cultural contexts and how they are created used selected and transferred through time  and be based around practicebased concerns principles and techniques could it also encompass disciplinary transdisciplinary and professional studies of topics relevant to archival ideas roles and interests that is broaden its scope into archival studies a study of archival education programs by elizabeth yakel published in  demonstrated the considerable growth in archival education offerings within lis and other informationbased programs  however that education was still quite traditional in terms of its content by contrast reviews of recent archival research indicate that archival studies appears to occupy much broader intellectual territory that can be located at various nexuses between the following  texts regardless of their media and format that serve to record document narrate educate and entertain  axiomatic constructs such as evidence memory culture identity accountability trust ethics space time enterprise and power relations  processes such as testifying remembering forgetting representing interpreting investigating adjudicating storytelling and believing  technologies for communicating recording creating disseminating retrieving socializing monitoring and controlling and  structures and surrogates that summarize represent and interpret information content contexts behaviors and requirements while similar discussions have also been occurring about the scope of lis education and research  we argue that archival studies research is particularly wellsituated within multidisciplinary ischoolsespecially ischools with faculty and students who are drawn from the social and human sciences and who encourage rich thinking about human bureaucratic and cultural as well as technological aspects of information in other words ischools have been good for archival studies and the reverse is probably also the case archival research that has emanated largely out of ischools over the past decade has moved well beyond the singleauthored historical survey or case studies that used to predominate as it seeks to address relevant questions arising at these nexuses today rapidly growing cohorts of faculty and doctoral students in archival studies are collaborating bidirectionally with increasing numbers of researchers drawn from other disciplines and are employing repurposing and adapting methods from an unusually diverse range of fields including diplomatic science and legal theory eg contemporary archival diplomatics critical race theory business administration and computer science eg business process analysis and metadata modeling and anthropology eg record keeping and archival ethnography as well as library and information science eg bibliometrics empirical instantiation  issues of archival concern such as the nature and role of the archive in a postmodern or postcolonial world and effective and appropriate cyberinfrastructure mechanisms for identifying validating describing preserving declassifying and curating digital documentation are also increasingly being investigated or theorized by scholars across many fields in the arts and humanities science and the social sciences often working within largescale collaborations the need to rethink the archival paradigm even with this innovation in the scope of the research questions being examined under the rubric of archival studies professional education in archival science is still constructed around a small set of traditional ideas and practices with the possible exception of the growing influence of the australiangenerated records continuum concept  these ideas and practices are predominantly derived from those of eighteenth nineteenth and early twentiethcentury europe  record keeping and archives during this period had evolved to provide essential bureaucratic support and legitimacy for emergent nation states colonial administrations mercantile and evangelical endeavors and even war efforts around the world when archival education began in the s in the united states it was to europe that instructors looked for models in the twentieth century western ideas and practices became further rationalized and institutionalized through the development of national and then international standards and best practices especially in the areas of archival descriptive and educational guidelines professional education and training in some cases with statemandated curricula located variously around the globe within government archives statesponsored archival schools professional associations as well as universities have promulgated the resulting professional paradigm of archival science into the twentyfirst century without any substantial critique if archival studies and indeed any other area of information studies is going to be a relevant useful and effective area of research and practice in a globalized digital postcolonial and increasingly postweberian world we would argue that the paradigm that supports its assumptions and fundamentally its identity as a field must be subject to continuous critical reexamination empirical testing and consequent reshaping in the case of the paradigm underlying traditional archival science such activities will help to ensure that it can be sufficiently robust and expansive not only to grapple with the archival implications of pervasive digitality but alsoand this is the particular focus of this articleto address other social and political changes that are occurring in the world the paradigm needs to be critiqued and expanded to ensure that it is both aware of and responsive to the nature needs and perspectives of local and global communities that heretofore have not been centrally addressed and indeed have often been marginalized by archival ideas theory and practices historically developed in support of the administrative requirements of powerful bureaucracies the most systematic and highprofile calls to rethink and restate archival theory and practice and to delineate how these might interact with the interests of other information and disciplinary communities have come in recent years from those who have been investigating the archival implications of digital record keeping or designing and operating digital libraries and archives systems designers and software developers legal and accountability experts and archival researchers and archivists are all grappling with issues such as how to define the parameters of a digital record how to identify the processes and guarantees by which users come to trust a digital record how to fix and set aside a digital record for future preservation and access and how to manage and exploit recordkeeping metadata  digital library and archive developers are striving to integrate different kinds of bibliographic and nonbibliographic materials within a single or federated digital resource as well as to implement technical and curatorial regimes that can support user trust in ongoing access to and manipulation of those resources  in both cases questions have been raised about what is the same and what is different between diverse types of resources in what ways digital resources and creator and user practices remain the same or take on different characteristics from analogous nondigital resources and creator and user practices if any exist and which professional principles remain applicable and which need to be rethought on the other hand calls to reconsider archival theory and practice and to challenge the inertia that seems to surround so much of the archival paradigm have also come from archival academics and practitioners influenced by postmodern and postcolonial scholarship  recognizing that we live in a world that is far different from the one that existed when archival ideas and practices were codified sue mckemmish anne gilliland and eric ketelaar write that archival literature increasingly points to the need to develop archival systems that can represent multiple recordkeeping realities encompassing or at least accommodating the differing and temporallybound world views of all those involved in the activities the records document and providing meaningful access paths to all stakeholders writers also suggest that there is a need to rethink definitions of records and archives that exclude orality literature art artefacts the built environment landscape dance ceremonies and rituals as archival forms postmodern ideas are opening up the possibility of refiguring the archive for example in societies like south africa archivists are exploring the archive outside the archival inheritance of colonialism and later apartheidthe oral record literature landscape songs dance ritual art artefacts and so on  this is a very different landscape in which to prepare archival practitioners than that to which much archival education caters it is one to which ischools with their interdisciplinary inclinations and multimethodological capacities may be particularly well disposed as noted above until the last fifteen years of the twentieth century professional archival education in the united states took place primarily within graduate history programs professional historians since the rise of modern scientific history in the nineteenth century have used archives more or less consciously to promote eurocentric ideas and shape national narratives for example as alluded to earlier in the united states the development of the national archives the foundation of a national professional association the society of american archivists and the associated drives to establish a robust body of archival theory and practice and professional archival education were very much tied in with the development of the field of professional academic history this in turn was very bound up with the apparatus of state and notions of statehood ian tyrrell writes as part of this legitimizing project scientific history showed the nation evolving from planted european antecedents some of these especially the spanish and the french atrophied or disappeared leaving more vigorous english versions as the successful transplants the germ from which the nation grew organically  in forging this genealogy of the state historians were mindful of their own changing and insecure position within the state structure the rapid political and economic reordering of american power postcivil war did not seem particularly hospitable to professors not only did academic freedom cases in the s reveal their vulnerable position  but also newly professionalized historians increasingly came from lower social classes than either their own predecessors in the universities or the patrician ranks of the amateurs these new historians lacked clout in mass parties and business and they imagined that their counterparts in europe had more influence over government the civil service and public life than they did  pp  american historians therefore wished to play a role in shaping national consciousnesses tyrell continues what was the key to merging imperial regional and local experience into a national stream of history academic history sought to colonize the state historical societies and universities with scientifically trained people with doctorates from universities as editor of the american historical review and director of the carnegiefunded bureau of historical research j franklin jameson took the lead in coordinating the local groups to link their findings with the national story jameson consistently advocated the primacy of the national over the local doing so partly out of a deep desire to exhibit historys wider significance and public usefulness not only did jameson assimilate older traditions of local inquiry involving genealogy oral history personal reminiscences and antiquarian documentary collections into a national research program privileging printed documents over popular memory in the process he put reverse pressure on local history insisting that it reflect national trends because local history was american history locally exemplified  in other words archives like all institutions are constructs until recently those constructs with the aid of an uncritiqued set of archival principles and practices supported the perspectives needs and interests of large bureaucracies such as governments businesses and religious organizations and historical and cultural interests and industries as represented by academic scholarship publishing and memory institutions today however circumstances have changed with the preparation of professional archivists taking place in the united states predominantly within ischools and library and information science lis programs the changed circumstances raise a number of questions about the goals and effects of such education for example to what extent do or should those informationbased increasingly multidisciplinary environments challenge the historically and bureaucratically driven intellectual and professional premises of archival science can we assess what has been or will be the impact on the professional field of archival science of the new research in archival studies occurring within these programs and what if anything is the influence of archival studies specializations upon the ischool or lis programs in which they are situated another important factor that should be considered in archival education is that communities groups and individuals once absent from or silent in the official record eg immigrant and diasporic communities indigenous communities survivors of traumatic or lifealtering events now wish to do their own archival construction or productionto capture their own often nontextual recordkeeping processes eg through dance song or recitation and generate their own narratives or to take control of their archival heritage relating to their communities that may now be located within the holdings of archival and collecting institutions  to do so they are bypassing traditional archives and archival practices which they do not see as supportive or relevant and are employing new techniques and technologies such as video histories documentary filmmaking blogging and social networking how might more broadly based archival studies as taught within ischools and lis programs better support these shifting documentary imperatives and community initiatives conversely what might ischools and lis programs learn from the experiences and exigencies of archival studies that might help them to promote pluralization and critical reflection across the rest of their education and research activities research projects seeking to pluralize archival education this section discusses two research projects that challenge the status quo with regard to the scope and nature of contemporary archival education and potentially of all education in lis programs or ischools pluralizing the archival paradigm through education pluralizing the archival paradigm through education which began in june  is an international research collaboration led by researchers at the university of california los angeles ucla in the united states and the caulfield school of information technology at monash university in australia participants have included archival faculty and students faculty from ancillary fields such as anthropology museum studies and ethnic studies and members of indigenous and other ethnic and racial communities and marginalized groups the project was funded by the university of californias pacific rim program to identify the scope and extent of archival education in the pacific rim and then to encourage research and development activities that would promote  culturally sensitive education of archival professionals in and from pacific rim communities and  the incorporation of the interests needs and cultural beliefs of diverse indigenous ethnic and marginalized communities into archival education and research programs in that region the project has employed surveys focus groups and research workshops to explore the state of archival education in pacific rim regions of north and south america asia australia and pacific island nations and to identify possible ways to develop culturally sensitive curricula and appropriate pedagogies and practices data gathered through project surveys suggest that archival education in the pacific rim can be broadly characterized in the following ways  archival education in the pacific rim currently focuses on teaching international standards and best practices while targeting national sector needs particularly national strategies for economic development both public and private  teaching the management of electronicdigital records appears to be a top priority for most programs followed by the paradigmatic aspects of contemporary archival theory and practice as promoted by the international council on archives and other professional organizations and  while there is recognition that different recordkeeping traditions may exist for example within indigenous communities these programs do not identify with or promote such traditions or indeed any specific local or community needs and perspectives beyond those related to local government and enterprise  invitational focus groups were organized in melbourne and los angeles in  and additional open discussion forums were held at the international council on archives conference in kuala lumpur and the society of american archivists conference in san francisco in  in order to engage in multiparty critical dialogue on issues relating to how archival education in the pacific rim has sustained and should further support pluralization in archival practice and scholarship several key questions and themes emerged from these dialogues that participants wished to see addressed in archival education and by extension in research and practice  who is best qualified to work with diverse and marginalized communities to address their recordkeeping and archival needs what kind of skill set and outlook would be most relevant how can students acquire the skills and knowledge to work in the community in culturally sensitive ways how can professionals and researchers be prepared to cope and help community members cope with the trauma that may be associated with records  what should be the role of archives in reclaiming and recovering community identity memory and history for example should archivists be trained to be activists should they learn how to develop metadata and design social computing environments that might support the presentation of alternate interpretations of archival holdings should they advocate for communities with nontextual records or intervene in situations where groups are being disadvantaged by recordkeeping or archival practices  how can the archival paradigm be extended to include other ways of keeping records for example through oral traditions and additional often nonwestern constructions of key concepts such as records evidence ownership time space authenticity and preservation  how can archival curricula and pedagogy be made more culturally sensitive and responsive to diverse community needs  this dialogue also led to the development of an action agenda which among other points called for a the development of a statement of principles for inclusive transformative record keeping and archival education that could be adopted by professional associations and used to inform course recognitionaccreditation b reconfiguring educational programs to be more inclusive culturally sensitive and diverse c establishing a databank of resources to support inclusive culturally sensitive education and research programs and d developing the research agenda relating to record keeping and archival education training and scholarship that addresses the needs of marginalized communities  race and remembering in a colorblind society a case study of racial paradigms and archival education in mexico in  white conducted a study that sought  to provide insight on how communities of african heritage became absent from mexicos official record  to describe mexicos archival education infrastructure and identify the role that education of archival professionals might play in addressing or contributing to these absences  using the case of mexicans of african descent in the costa chica home of the largest mexican community of african descent to delineate ways of remembering in nonindigenous ethnic communities and  to generate recommendations for how underdocumentation and the resulting absences of these kinds of communities from the archival record might be partly remediated by changing how archivists are educated the significance of this study lies in part with contemporary ideas of race in mexico which are dominated by the concept of mestizaje racial and cultural mixture as the dominant paradigm mestizaje has allowed for a somewhat unified idea of what it means to be mexican although mexican anthropologist gonzalo beltrán estimated that enslaved africans or remnants thereof were one of the largest population groups of mexican society by the mideighteenth century little or no reference is included in the countrys grand narrative  after gaining independence from spain mexico engineered a new national identityone that considered itself to be mestizo racially and culturally mixed mestizaje ideology permitted a sympathetic investigation of and linkage to the new nations indigenous past in doing so other minority groups such as mexicans of african descent were silenced and erased from the official historical and contemporary narratives of mexican nationhood and national identity despite strong historical evidence that indicates a large african population in colonial mexico the archetypical mexican is even today represented to be mestizothe product of an unproblematic cultural and racial mixture of spanish and indigenous people with no acknowledgment of the nations african heritage this situation is reinforced by official record keeping which provides no way for mexicans of african descent to identify themselves as such even though their communities continue to experience racial discrimination and marginalization white hypothesized that archivistsif they were professionally educated within a more reflexive and culturally sensitive archival paradigm might be better prepared to understand how professional frameworks for appraisal arrangement and description preservation access and exhibitionhave the ability to compound or redress some of the underempowerment caused by mestizaje  similar to the research findings of the pluralizing the archival paradigm project the finding of this study indicated that archival educators and professionals in mexico are not being educated to address memory keeping which is traditional in ethnic or indigenous communities instead archival education curricula focuses on teaching to meet international standards and best practices predominantly based on european recordkeeping practices and juridical traditions the curricula also privilege national sector needs particularly those relating to enterprise ie national strategies for economic development both public and private based on the results of survey data of archival educators and practitioners semistructured interviews of cultural gatekeepers in the afromexican community and ethnographic data of the ways of remembering in afromexican communities which included ritual dance corridos or ballads and even food ways a framework was developed consisting of six elements that would support systematically incorporating the interests needs and cultural beliefs of diverse communities into mexicos archival education curriculum  conceptual expansion eg incorporating different conceptualizations of the record by different communities particularly those with nonwestern epistemologies  embeddedness eg locating field and service learning experiences within communities to gain a richer understanding of community needs  collaboration eg partnering with communitybased organizations in efforts to cultivate equitable mutually beneficial longterm teaching learning and research partnerships  leadership activism and ethics eg expanding the archival role in promoting the visibility of underdocumented communities  sustainability eg planning and program developments that are sensitive to the communitys resources and relevant to its cultural protocols  reflexivity eg critical examination of the body of knowledge comprising archival theory and practice but also of the role and standpoint of the archival instructor scholar or professional   advancing reflexivity and inclusivity through archival education so practically speaking what can be done within archival education programs to nudge them out of their traditional scope and make them more responsive to the kinds of concerns and needs being expressed by underrepresented or marginalized communities as well as more closely aligned with the intellectual territory now occupied by archival studies research to support a critical sensibility and more reflexive and inclusive archival research and practice archival education should seek to juxtapose and discuss both traditional and counterconstructions of the archive as it exists in and across time basing curriculum around the records continuum with its multidimensional and spacetime framework will assist students in understanding the individual institutional and societal aspects of archives records and evidence archival education should also incorporate thorough discussion of the intellectual lineage of archival concepts and practices and discuss in both theoretical terms and using real life cases the power implications of these concepts and practices postcolonial ideas and examples of the colonial archival endeavor should be introduced jeanette bastian for example in noting that postcolonial scholars find that colonial records offer the voices of the master narrative but do not reflect the voices of the oppressed and voiceless suggests remedying this by framing records within their social provenance and a community of records  again with reallife examples and taking its lead from definitional work done with digital records archival education should approach concerns regarding the nature and role of the archive and the record functionally and procedurally rather than ideologically in other words students should be taught to understand the purpose of record keeping and archives in societies and then how to identify those procedures texts and collecting activities regardless of form or media within those societies that serve those purposes a persistent problem in archival practice is that very little practicebased research is undertaken few tested benchmarks exist to aid in evaluating archival activities and many archives operate on the basis of unchallenged assumptions and inherited wisdom this poses special challenges in the digital environment where it is unclear whether traditional assumptions and practices continue to be effective and where one of the most difficult issues is defining conceptually procedurally and technologically the parameters of digital records all students should have training in research methods so that they may be better able approach their work empirically as well as critically the question however is what sort of methods training is likely to be most effective for the kinds of issues they are likely to face as professionals or as researchers while students should obviously be encouraged to take methods courses in areas that are most relevant to their career goals there is no doubt that availability of courses in ethnography and in video and oral history would be valuable to those seeking to work in communitybased archives or in culturally sensitive settings management and policy curricula also need to challenge the notion of the big archival institution to which all records and collections will flow curricula need to address how nontraditional archives such as for example personal communitybased or internetbased archives should be organized and managed this might involve discussions of new organizational and economic models for digital or special media preservation cooperatives the curriculum should also address relevant policy in different national and cultural contexts eg ownership and other forms of property and moral rights personal privacy and national security transnational movement of artifacts and indigenous sovereignty concerns  beyond the curricula there are also questions about how to teach eg employing more casebased and service learning where to teach eg within communities such as indigenous communities where there is emotional support and intellectual context rather than requiring community members to come to the academic institutions and who should teach the latter question raises a number of difficult issues for the field of archival science and for ischools the pluralizing the archival paradigm project as well as the recent society of american archivists acensus both indicate that almost all faculty in all the countries involved are drawn from similar social ethnic and racial backgrounds within the ischools at least there is progress being made in terms of the disciplinary diversity of the academic backgrounds of faculty teaching in archival studies although the diminishing numbers of faculty with professional archival experience is causing some concern within the archival profession because faculty have very similar backgrounds and were themselves trained within the dominant archival paradigm how well equipped are they to advance the reflexivity and cultural sensitivity of their programs we are not suggesting that ethnic andor experiential diversity alone will make things better but rather that those types of diversity along with a more diverse range of theoretical and cultural frameworks and perspectives will result in a richer educational environment adjunct faculty have always augmented ladder faculty and helped to integrate reallife perspectives into professional education bringing in teachers from a more diverse range of community as well as institutional backgrounds would also help pluralize the educational environment moreover educational programs could go much further toward recognizing and entering into partnerships with traditional teachers within communities such as elders in indigenous communities who have a standing and knowledge that is likely to be quite different from that of most academics examples of implementations this article concludes by citing examples of three different efforts that are underway to address some of the issues raised in the prior discussion implementation a the ucla department of information studies has implemented several strategies to support a more culturally sensitive and responsive curriculum for all its master of library and information science mlis students including those in its archival studies specialization the mlis program includes six required core courses each of which must include components addressing aspects of the three mlis specializations areaslibrary studies archival studies and informatics students are also required to select one from a minimum of three different research methods courses offered each year both the core course information and society and the introductory course in american archives and manuscripts provide students with a review of the intellectual lineage of the information and specifically in this case the archival science fields as well as media theory an area that can be further explored in electives provided through the ma program in moving image archive studies five years ago the program first implemented a required core course entitled diversity ethics and change which includes elements drawn from cultural and critical race theory as well as a significant servicelearning component whereby students are placed in nontraditional information settings often within different ethnic or racial communities to carry out information organization or consulting activities building upon that experience within the archival studies specialization two new electives have been developedone with an academic special collections perspective collecting community materials and one that approaches the issue of community documentation from the opposite perspective communitybased archiving the latter course which also has a significant servicelearning component partners students with community groups who are working to document their own activities or retain their own archival materials either physically or digitally the course addresses issues of cultural and language barriersincluding obtaining entrée and building trust notions of how an archive might be alternately conceived within that community and designed to support those notions how to develop a support base for the archival endeavor and economic and collaborative mechanisms for sustaining the archive and ensuring its preservation over time implementation b at the university of oklahoma school of library and information studies which is in the process of developing a new archival studies specialization that draws in particular on the states native american heritage the core course is designed to introduce students to historicaltheoretical foundations and key practicestermsconcepts of the archival professions this is covered in roughly the first half of the course during the second half of the course students are introduced to the ideas of postmodernism postcolonialism constructionism especially in the context of how histories are constructed cultural theory and pluralism those concepts are further explored in an archival context and are then used to critique traditional archival theory by using indigenous afromexican and asianpacific communities as cases implementation c in july  a collaboration of programs preparing doctoral students in archival studies at ucla the university of michigan the university of pittsburgh the university of maryland the university of north carolina chapel hill the university of texas and simmons college was funded by the institute of library and information services to provide two sets of fouryear doctoral fellowships in successive years the fellowships are designed to encourage the development of new diverse cohorts of educators in archival studies who are versed in contemporary issues and research methodologies and to implement annual weeklong summer archival education and research institutes aeri for doctoral students and faculty from the united states and worldwide the goals of the institutes are to  create a network and community of faculty and students to help mentor doctoral students and junior faculty  advance curriculum and pedagogical development in archival studies  further current research development through presentations posters and workshop activities  foster interest in future collaborations both nationally and internationally the first institute took place at ucla with  faculty and doctoral attendees and drew upon local institutional and research expertise and experiences especially those relating to moving image sound and other media ethnic indigenous diasporic and other communitybased initiatives conservation and preservation practices and digital record keeping and curatorship the second institute will be held in june  at the university of michigan conclusion concomitant with the rapid expansion of archival studies as an interdisciplinary and multimethodological area of ischool and lis education and research we have argued for the need to rethink transform and expand the traditional underlying archival paradigm so that it is more reflective of the shifting cultural social technological and political demands and changes that are occurring in the twentyfirst century arguably and at the risk of gross overgeneralization such expansion would never have occurred if archival education had remained predominantly located within history programs because it would not have had the same exposure to disciplines technologies and methods as well as empirical research infrastructure training and funding incentives moreover it would likely have remained focused on the historical and artifactual aspects of records and archives rather than on the human bureaucratic and cultural systems within which records and archives reside and perform without such a rethinking and transformation there is little doubt that the field would continue to expand but it would likely result in archival studies being a less relevant useful and effective area of research practice and indeed activism than it could be in an increasingly postcolonial digital globalized world reflexivity and inclusivity in archival education practice and research will help to create opportunities for educators students and practitioners to gain a richer understanding of diverse user communities and their interaction with all forms of records and archives in and across space and time archival studies may also thereby provide encouragement for other ischool and lis educators and researchers to examine more critically and with more cultural sensitivity the lineage and impact of the paradigms that they are applying
