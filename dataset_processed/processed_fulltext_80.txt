journal of education for librarianship effort was made to eliminate the names of teachers who were not members of the regular full time faculty and whose principal professional responsibility lay outside of the library school in order to determine a person principal area of professional responsibility names were searched in biographical library associations membership and library directories such as who who in library science who who in america american library association membership list and american library directory biographical sketches located through library literature and library schools catalogs and annual reports were also used for this purpose to ascertain whether or not a faculty member held an earned doctorate and the year in which and the university where it was conferred all names were searched in charles h davis doctoral dissertations in library science titles accepted by accredited library schools   gail a schlachter and dennis thomison library science dissertations   an annotated bibliography index volumes of dissertation abstracts library literature the national union catalog and the listings of dissertations found in library quarterly no one of these publications singly or collectively provides complete coverage of all dissertations in library science or another discipline information regarding doctorates earned by faculty members was often gleaned from the biographical sources listed above a written request was made to every accredited library school program for a copy of the listing of its current faculty and its catalog in order to determine with as much accuracy as possible whether or not a faculty member held a doctorate most schools responded microfiche copies of catalogs were searched for schools failing to supply the requested materials older catalogs and annual reports whenever they were available were also searched for this type of information letters for further information were written to faculty members for whom doctorates were listed in their schools catalogs but for whom no entry was located in one of the above sources verifying the degree data were collected for each time faculty member for the  year period from  to  since the primary purposes of this study were to determine whether or not there was an over all discernible trend either downward or upward in the percentage of earned doctorates held collectively as a group and also by academic rank and sex of the faculties a detailed analysis of the data was made at six year intervals in doing so the over all trends were detected without the inclusion of a huge mass of additional details in this report the years chosen and the number of accredited programs included based on the directory issue for the corresponding year in the report are as follows    schools    schools    schools and    schools 
library school faculty doctorates a statistical review findings of the study are show in table   because of the small percentage of faculty members who held the ranks of instructors and lecturers no textual analysis has been made of the data for these two ranks which are found in table   any further analysis of these data would have little if any significance for this report as is obvious in the summary at the end of table  the over all percentage of faculty members with an earned doctorate increased steadily from  percent in  to  percent in   more than doubling within a period of  years the over all percentage of faculty with a doctorate in the ranks of professor associate professor and assistant professor including dean showed a progressive increase for each year included in the survey with the exception of  when a slight drop occurred in the over all percentage at the professor level a comparison of the statistics rank by rank reveals that there was a correlation between the percentage of earned doctorates and academic rank for each year analyzed in this report with one exception in the case of deans for  a greater percentage of doctorates was found in each ascending rank thus the over all percentage of deans with doctorates was higher than that of professors with doctorates for each year except  similarly the over all percentage of professors with doctorates was higher than that of associate professors and a higher percentage of associate professors held doctorates than assistant professors for each of the four years included in this report from an analysis of table   it would appear that a doctorate had almost become one of the prerequisites for advancement in academic rank during the period covered by this study the largest over all increase in the percentage of doctorates held was made at the assistant professor level the percentage has increased from  percent in  to  percent in   an increase of four and half fold the over all percentage of doctorates at the associate professor level had more than doubled in the same period in   percent of the faculty members with the rank of associate professor held doctorates by  the percentage had reached  percent of the total the increase in the percentage of women holding doctorates has been more spectacular than that of men however at the same time there has been a steady over all increase in the number of men and conversely a decline in the number of women on the faculties in  a majority   percent  of the faculty positions were filled by women of whom  percent held doctorates men held  percent of the positions of the male faculty members  percent had earned their doctorates in actual numbers there were  women and  men with doctorates as

journal of education for librarianship accepted practice in academe in the united states is to evaluate the educational quality of the faculty by the percentage of doctorates held this practice has also become common in library education as a part of their study of the impact of the increase of library doctorates herbert s white and karen momenee checked advertisements placed by library schools over a six month period from june  to december  in selected higher education and professional library journals they found that of the  positions advertised by ala accredited library schools with doctoral programs  required a doctorate four of which were willing to accept a subject doctorate in place of a library science doctorate the other two advertisements showed a decided preference for a library science doctorate without however absolutely demanding one white and momenee further found that of the  positions advertised by the schools without doctoral programs   made the doctorate a firm requirement even though  would accept the non library science doctorate as an alternative the one remaining school preferred without requiring a subject doctorate rather one in library science in their study white and momenee concluded that the importance of the earned doctorate for faculty in library schools in establishing and retaining status for the school within its own academic setting is recognized cannot be ignored and is probably behind much of the recent upgrading in educational requirements for faculty in library schools in fact schools that have recently undergone ala accreditation visits recognize the stress placed by the accreditation teams on both the number and diversity of earned doctorates as an indication of faculty competence in using the doctorate as the single criterion forjudging the educational quality of the faculties there has been a significant improvement since  in   percent held doctorates as contrasted by  percent holding doctorates in  thereby representing a percentage point gain of  or almost a doubling of the percentage points within a period of   years during which the number of teachers increased four fold the question may be asked how do the library school faculties compare in their academic training with their counterparts in academe the most recent statistics showing the percentage of doctoral degrees held by university faculties in the united states are for   compiled by alan e bayer based on a sample survey for the american council on education with one significant difference his data reveal that the library school faculties were more or less on an equal par with their fellow colleagues in terms of the doctorate based upon these statistics  percent of the university faculty members held doctorates as compared to  percent of the library school teachers of the men  percent of the university

journal of education for librarianship to pgrade traditionally female professions  nursing librarianship and elementary education  by recruiting more men into them her hypothesis is based upon the following premise it is statistically obvious that the quality of faculties must improve if the recruiting base of equally qualified personnel is broadened while total numbers of those selected must remain constant or decrease she claims that there is some evidence that this reasoning has now been applied to male dominated teaching fields based upon her investigations women on science faculties increased about three times faster than total faculty growth between  and  and growth in the proportion of women at all ranks was fastest in research universities which traditionally had the fewest women hornig explanation as applied to the increase in the percentage of male library school faculty members may be disputed on several points her explanation fails to take into account the fact that in the late sixties and up to the middle of the seventies there was a large increase in enrollment in the library school programs throughout the country with this increase in enrollment came also an increase in the number of library school teachers therefore the number of teaching positions in library science did not remain constant nor did the number decrease as suggested in hornig explanation schlachter and thomison in their study of the library science doctorate a quantitative analysis of dissertations and recipients for the period from  to  found that women received on average less than one third of the library science doctorates in any given year using the statistical data provided in george h brown study of degree awards to women an update for the national center for education statistics women received an average of  percent of the library science doctorates awarded between the years   and   contrary to the implication contained in hornig explanation the recruiting base of equally qualified personnel as judged in terms of the doctorate did not exist in library science males constituted a decided majority within the recruiting base the supply of women with doctorates was not available from which women teachers could be selected librarianship has been dominated by women for a long time in this country based upon the  census  percent of the librarians were women and  percent men in its  survey of professional staffs in academic and public libraries the ala office of library personnel resources found from an  percent return that women represented  percent of these staffs and men  percent leigh s estabrook and kathleen m heim using the annual placement and salary surveys in library journal between  and  calculated that the percentage of women receiving master degrees from ala

journal of education for librarianship in the same manner that male faculty members have done for male students in the past in their capacity as role models women faculty members can encourage other women to seek and can sponsor them for positions of leadership in the profession and encourage them to pursue doctoral studies and assist them in obtaining financial aid for these studies directly as a result of discussions held at the preconference a resolution was introduced by futas on behalf of the workshop on education and subsequently adopted by both the participants in the preconference and the ala membership meeting at the  annual conference resolving that the membership of the american library association directs the committee on accreditation to evaluate the positive implementation of affirmative action law as one of the criterion sic for accreditation or a re accreditation of the library schools in the course of the discussion of the preconference workshop on education it had been suggested that accreditation and re accreditation might be used as a strategy the first target would be the schools where the faculty was heavily male where the stress was on getting male doctoral students and where scholarship and fellowship aid went predominately to male candidates just prior to the announcement by the us supreme court of its decision in the bakke case the ala council at the  annual conference passed a resolution encouraging all alaaccredited library schools in the united states to continue affirmative action programs in admissions and employment the substance of this resolution had been discussed earlier by the task force on women at the  midwinter meeting at the  annual conference the committee on the status of women in librarianship sponsored a preconference on women in a woman profession  strategies ii from which culminated a number of motions for consideration by the council and ala membership among them was a proposed motion that the ala council direct the committee on accreditation to include affirmative action reports on faculty staff and students the motion was passed by the membership the council which approved it in principle voted to refer the motion to coa for a report at the  midwinter meeting at the time the council asked coa to revise its standards by removing sexist language and adding affirmative action statements the second printing of the standards was published in april  a comparison of the second printing with the original printing reveals that the sexist langauge has been removed from the document and inserted within the last sentence of the last paragraph of the introductory sections just before section i program goals and objectives a provision that in 
library school faculty doctorates a statistical review appointment promotion or pay of faculty and support staff discimination because of age race color creed religion physical disability or sex    shall be a violation of these standards in the original printing the anti discrimination provision applied only to recruitment admissions or financial aid nowhere in the second printing of the standards is made any specific mention of affirmative action coa does not view itself as an enforcement agency for federal and state laws coa believes that the responsibility for fulfillment of the standards lies with the parent institution of which the library school is a part whether or not the inclusion of an anti discrimination provision in the standards will result in a larger percentage of women faculty members remains to be seen success depends on a number of rather intangible factors foremost are the efforts made and the pressure applied on the part of the parent institutions and their affirmative action agencies and library school deans and their faculty selection committees to pursue similar goals in re accreditating library school prorams coa can in its purview evaluate the extent to which library schools have been successful in fulfilling the anti discrimination provision of the standards and can make written recommendations for further implementation it must however be pointed out that while the committee as a part of its evaluation examines each of the component factors the final judgment is concerned with totality of the effort and the environment for learning in which it is carried on the decision regarding accreditation is approached from an assessment of this totality rather than from a consideration of isolated factors the standards further state that the aim of the standards for accreditation is to provide guidance for the present which is sufficiently flexible to allow for future developments the standards are indicative but not prescriptive as with the former standards the meaning and meaningfulness of the present standards must lie in their application thus in the final analysis therefore the anti discrimination provision found in the standards is one but one of many factors tobe considered by coa a decision to accredit or re accredit a library school program does not rest solely upon any one factor the meaning given to the anti discrmination provision depends on future events and the interpretation given to it by coa at a given point in time the effectiveness of this anti discrimination is uncertain in the interests of objectivity it must be pointed that there is not unanimity as to the need for women to serve as role models in education hornig found that there is only scattered evidence to suggest that predominantly male faculties may not be able to provide an optimal education for the female half of the student body this area needs further 
journal of education for librarianship investigation there are feeble indications that women may be on their way toward re establishing an equilibrium with men in their numbers among the library school faculties based upon this study the number of male assistant professors usually the entry level for most new faculty members had declined from  in  to   in  and women had just slightly increased their numbers in this rank from  to  a similar trend is found in bidlack statistical survey for   he reported that  new faculty members were hired of whom  were males and  females of these  males and  females were appointed to assistant professorships in his report on degree awards made to women brown singled out library science as the field which had the largest gain in doctorates awarded to women from  and  the percentage of doctorates awarded to women had increased from  percent to  percent or a point gain of   however the statistics for   as reported by the national research council in its survey of earned doctorates showed that this incease has not sustained itself for this latest year men received   percent and women  percent of the doctorates in library science in their analysis of  recipients of library science doctorates completed between  and  schlachter and thomison found that although the majority of all doctorates go into teaching proportionately more women are currently serving as faculty and more men are working as library administrators whether or not this past trend has and will continue in the future requires further research presently women are seeking careers in professions and types of work which in the past have been largely closed to them and they are turning away from fields in which they were found in greater numbers in the past as a consequence fewer women may decide to seek careers in librarianship and women with library science doctorates in increasingly larger numbers may decide to seek administrative positions in libraries rather than to enter teaching summary the phd in library science then followed by the phd in another discipline is the most common type of doctorate held by library school faculty members trailing far behind the d ls the edd is the degree least frequently held a host of  library schools have been responsible for providing faculty holding an earned library doctorate with their education based upon the years included in this survey eight schools  five located in the great lakes region and three in the east  have been responsible for granting the library science doctorate to more than  percent of library school teachers of these eight schools columbia university has awarded almost all the d l s degrees other than 
library school faculty doctorates a statistical review library science the fields found most frequently pursued as majors for the phd were the humanities and education the least frequently found fields were science engineering and social sciences in spite of the noteworthy progress that has been made since  in raising the over all educational level of the library school faculties as judged in terms of the percentage of earned doctorates held there still exists a need for a more equitable balance in the representation of men and women and a need to raise the over all educational quality of women teachers as judged in the percentage of doctorates held to approximate that of men more closely the gap in the representation of men and women and in the percentage of terminal degrees held by the two sexes is too wide men in  maintained an edge of  points in the percentage of faculty positions and an edge of  points in the percentage of doctorates held by them over women men in  held  percent of the library school deanships and professor and associate professorships as a rule these positions are generally tenured in most institutions of higher learning faculty members in these ranks usually serve as role models encouraging students to pursue doctoral studies assisting them in obtaining financial aid for their studies and sponsoring for them for teaching as well as administrative positions in libraries the crust of the problem appears to lie in the need to recruit more women with an interest in teaching into the doctoral programs women constitute more than  percent of the student bodies of the library schools and the profession as a whole with this vast reservoir of human resources library schools should be able to recruit a sufficient number of academically qualified women interested in teaching into their doctoral programs additional women teachers serving as role models can encourage yet other women to pursue doctoral studies and to sponsor them for teaching positions as is obvious from an analysis of table  there has been a significant increase from  to  in the number of library school faculty members with phd in the social sciences sciences and engineering in spite of this increase the total number remains rather miniscule when viewed from the universe of the accredited library school programs in  there was an average of less than one teacher with a doctorate in these three fields combined per school admittedly there were other faculty members who held master degrees in these fields however it is well known that the profession since its inception in this country has been more closely tied to the humanities than to the social sciences sciences and engineering there yet remains a need to obtain greater representation of teachers with doctorates in these fields
