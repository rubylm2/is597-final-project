conceptual strategies for operationalizing multicultural curricula getinet belay this paper discusses the challenges and opportunities that multiculturalism presents to library and information science education multiculturalism here is synonymous with cultural diversity and denotes the recent critical concepts that are counterposed to ethnocentrism cultural monolithicism and the assumption of epistemological universality the aim of this essay is to develop conceptual strategies that will contribute to the operationalization of a multicultural curriculum to provide that framework the discussions draw upon concepts and literature from a variety of research fields that deal with the role of culture in human cognitive processes and informational behaviors these include anthropology cross cultural psychology ethnocognitivism and intercultural communication multiculturalism one of the major problems in conceptualizing multiculturalism is the ambiguity of the term as it is presently used in both public and scholarly discourse first the term depending on the context in which it is used refers to two different dimensions of cultural diversity in an administrative and political context multiculturalism refers specifically to policy issues regarding the institutional and social inclusion of individuals or groups that belong to cultural minorities these policy issues include affirmative action equal opportunity employment recruitment and retention of minorities and secondary discrimination cohen  foxman and polsky  johnston and packer  loden and rosener  madrid  smith  solomon  thiedermann  in the context of curriculum development and scholarship however the issues that multiculturalism raises go far beyond minoritarianism in this latter case multiculturalism refers to the need to recognize and to address the cultural diversity of human cognitive styles kaplan getinet belay is an assistant professor in the school of communication information and library studies at rutgers university new brunswick new jersey fall

conceptual strategies for operationalizing multicultural curricula why multicultural curricula richardson and king  have characterized the ability to recognize accept and deal with the various elements of cultural diversity as one of the key survival skills that will be needed in the twenty first century the growing interest in a multicultural curriculum reflects new educational needs that have arisen as a result of the challenges posed by profound changes that are taking place both at the international and national levels for students of library and information science as future scholars and professionals in a highly interconnected and interdependent global environment several factors make it imperative to have grounding in the role of culture in human informational and communication behavior the internationalization of the information industry along with the transnational nature of the new information technologies have contributed to a growing linkage between national and international information issues and processes dosa  hudson  jussawalla and cheah  lukyen  orien and helleiner  of particular relevance for understanding the significance that factors of cultural diversity have acquired as a result of this linkage in contemporary informational processes is that nations constitute not just politico economic and jurisdictional entities as traditional economistic and sociological approaches imply but also cultural systems barnlund  chu  gudykunst and ting toomey  hofstede  this means that information exchange and data transfer between any two nations for example between the united states and japan or between france and kenya is not only communication between countries with different sociological andor politico economic structures and interests but also one involving people that operate in accord with different cognitive styles and informational behaviors moreover the end of the cold war has meant that the traditional ideological paradigms can no longer serve as frames for interpreting and predicting national behaviors and global information processes the shift from socio political ideological constructs to cultural identity including ethnicity as the prime dynamic forces in post cold war international affairs boulding  casmir  has brought into focus the significance of cultural factors to conceptualizing information policies and processes in the contemporary world equally significant are two separate but in their impact highly interrelated changes that are taking place at the domestic level in a sociological sense one major new demographic development in the united states today is that the majority of the work force is no longer engaged in the manufacturing industry but rather in the information industry schement  katz  hudson and leung  this change in the sectoral demography of the work force has occurred parallel with changes in the cultural demography of the labor force already today fall  
journal of education for library and information science more than half the us work force consists of women africanamericans hispanics asian americans and other cultural minorities according to thomas  white males will make up only  percent of the increase in the work force over the next ten years before the year  the majority of the population of california the most populous state will no longer be white nor necessarily english speaking the challenges that these two simultaneous structural changes pose to the society at large and specifically to information policymakers and service providers are evident while the new sociological and economic roles of information mean that the efficient production and distribution of information have become the primary preoccupations of the labor force the growing cultural diversity of the work force implies that effectiveness and efficiency in the production and distribution of information require not only solutions to technical and technological problems but also to problems of multiculturalism according to yousef  many personnel problems in us corporations today have to do with the lack of skills to handle behavioral ambiguities that are associated with the growing cultural diversity at the workplace not professional expertise or technical competence the development and adoption of multicultural curricula are therefore not just ethical or moral questions but also questions of enlightened self interest besides multicultural curricula could help not only to overcome the increasing decline of minority enrollment in library and information science programs josey    but also to make library and information science education more relevant to international students who despite the consistent increase of their enrollment carnovsky  deolivera  sineath  are strongly critical about the relevance of the training they receive to their specific cultural contexts and home country informational environments carnovsky  chen  lundu  tallman  finally the need to overcome ethnocentric confines in information theory building presents yet another compelling reason for developing multicultural curricula koester and lustig  have argued that present day information and communication theories hardly account for nonanglo or non european cognitive styles interpretive frames and behavioral modes this limitation contributes to the flawed assumption that theories developed on and applied to members of the european or anglo us culture have universal validity exposure to basic research on the cultural diversity of human informational behavior would help sensitize students to the kinds of adaptations and changes necessary to generalize theories beyond individual cultural communities dimensions of operationalization operationalizing a multicultural curriculum requires conceptualization of two dimensions of library and information science instruction  volume  number 
conceptual strategies for operationalizing multicultural curricula pedagogical and content related the pedagogical dimension relates to the need to develop methods of instruction that take into account the affective behavioral and cognitive problems that arise in a culturally diverse classroom the content related dimension concerns the crosscultural applicability of the skills and theories taught in various library and information science courses in regard to pedagogical methodology instructors often are either unaware or lack strategies for facilitating the traumatic process of situational and contextual adjustment that students go through in an educational environment that operates counter to their cultural expectations for example in many library and information science programs as in an increasing number of fields such as communication female students constitute the majority assuming that in any given course the instructor too is female male students are generally confronted with the problem of adjusting to the shift in their traditional status often they display not only the same anxieties and ego defensive prejudices that minorities tend to develop toward majorities but also in situations of power asymmetry those characteristic minority behaviors that folb  has described as invisibility another example is the adjustment that students from various cultural backgrounds make to the roles and behaviors used by instructors and students in the us educational system for students from south and southeast asia where extrovert communication behavior is culturally constrained and where asking questions in class is considered a threat to the instructor authority andersen and powell  the us educational system which encourages students to actively participate in class discussions and even to challenge their instructor requires tremendous behavioral adjustment far more complex is the problem of adjustment connected with the cultural diversity of learning behavior research has shown that most students from certain cultures such as hispanics albert  ramirez and castañeda  and africanamericans hale  have a strong field dependent or field sensitive cognitive style for these students the dominant educational system that according to ramirez and castañeda  relies almost exclusively on the use of methods geared toward persons whose perceptual style is field independent presents serious problems of adjustment moreover cognitivist research has suggested a relationship between culture brain hemisphericity and education lieberman  claims that the teacher usually teaches in the style in which he or she has been trained traditionally left hemisphere in the united states and that the student tries to match his or her learning style to that of the teacher which often leads to learning some material missing some material and tuning out numerous educators suggest that teachers learn to understand the duality of their students minds p fall  
journal of education for library and information science studies on the cultural patterns of thought and problem solving are far from establishing the essential cognitive differences between cultures moreover ethnocognitivist studies do not offer clarity as to the patterns and styles that are universally human influenced by cultural transmission or idiosyncratic to the individual however a growing body of research suggests several differences between cultures in cognitive processing and problem solving cole  collins and dedre  felder and silverman  freedle  helgesen  kaplan  paredes and hepburn  tsunoda  stressing the significance of these differences to developing effective instructional methods lesser  argues that we will not have a successful multicultural educational system until we first examine the cultural diversity in the us classroom and address the thinking patterns and problemsolving styles of these cultures of course the culturally other students should also master the cognitive styles as well as the roles and behaviors that are appropriate in their new educational environment because the problem of intercultural interaction can be solved only through the interactant acquisition of a new cultural competence however in order that this competence can be developed successfully and efficiently by the culturally other students the interaction between instructor and student should be conducted as one of mutual adaptation rather than a one sided acculturation besides instructional methods a multicultural approach to library and information science education should also consider the content of instruction the central issue here is the need to examine whether the skills and theories taught in various courses have culturespecific or cross cultural applicability the flawed assumptions to which ethnocentric confines in information theory building contribute have already been mentioned the pragmatic question as to how multiculturalism should be infused into library and information science curricula will be the next focus emphasis here is on the effect that the parameters of validity of various skills and theories taught in the classroom have on students students generally are motivated to learn three types of skills andor theories those that are common to universal human and social experience those that are based on and applicable to their own specific experience and cultural context and those that are unique to the experience and context of another culture or other cultures while students interest in the first two types of skills andor theories is self evident the latter ones are also relevant because they serve students both as competencies for understanding and dealing with the otherness of others and as comparative frames for reflecting upon their culturally unique experiences and conditions however students find it difficult to handle skills and theories that imply them but do not include them skills and theories that are developed on and are applicable to a given culture but explicitly  volume  number 
conceptual strategies for operationalizing multicultural curricula or implicitly claim universal validity belong to a fourth category one of the damaging consequences of an instructional content geared toward this fourth type of skills and theories is that it makes the culturally other students insecure lethargic and even cynical examples of this are skills and theories taught with regard to successful and efficient dyadic interaction an area of inquiry common to library and information science and several behavioral and cognitive studies such as communication and psychology research has shown that the instructional content of courses dealing with dyadic interactional behavior are grounded in the european american cultural patterns of individuality openness and directness including anxietyreductionist message design and linear organization of speeches elliot and others  kaplan  koester and lustig  purves  these patterns are however not necessarily consistent with those preferred by other cultural groups such as african americans or asian americans foeman and pressley  kochman  ogawa  moreover those patterns have little relevance to a variety of international students for whom ambiguity and indirectness are either culturally appropriate interactional strategies or consistent with the structures of their native languages ishii and bruneau  koester and lustig  purves  this is by no means to suggest that the content of library and information science courses should reflect the perspectives of every culture represented in the classroom neither the competence of a single instructor nor the time constraints of classroom instruction would allow such an approach to multicultural education however instructors should verify whether the skills and theories that constitute the instructional content of their respective courses are multicultural in their conceptualization and whether they have been tested with culturally diverse subject populations in the case of theories developed and tested in one or a limited number of cultural contexts the parameters of validity should be specified in this latter case the culturally other students could be utilized as resources for discussing or even researching the applicability of the respective skills and concepts beyond the cultural boundaries within which they have been tested operationalization strategies like in many other forums at this year annual conference of the association of library and information science educators in san antonio the discussions on multicultural curricula revolved around one central question it concerns whether multiculturalism should be injected into library and information science programs at the curriculum or individual course level in other words should the relationship between culture and human informational behavior be taught within existing courses or in new and separate courses developed specifically to fall  
journal of education for library and information science discuss the relationship by addressing this question i will attempt to suggest strategies that in my view would contribute to effective multicultural education the dichotomy that the prior question constructs implies a distinction between standard course topics and multicultural course topics to put it another way developing new courses as the only strategy to accommodate cultural diversity would mean that existing courses do not require multicultural perspectives in designing strategies to operationalize multicultural curricula an important point to consider is that multiculturalism does not introduce new topics but rather new approaches to teaching old topics clearly some skills courses eg courses dealing with indexing and abstracting cataloging are hardly influenced by cultural variables but most skills and theory courses eg courses dealing with information and communication technology management of information services information needs and research address topics that are strongly influenced by cultural factors topics such as effectiveness of service policy or technology including user friendliness should be taught and discussed from multicultural perspectives multiculturalism should be infused to problematize topics connected with the assessment of information needs information seeking behavior etc in this sense a multicultural curriculum means first and foremost infusing cultural diversity into the topics that are treated in existing courses it does not necessarily require the development and adoption of separate or new courses this does not negate however developing a course or courses specifically geared toward the international and cultural dimensions of information exchange such entry level courses would not only help to promote general intercultural and transnational awareness among students but also provide them with basic knowledge that they can take into various library and information courses in the phd program of the school of communication information and library studies at rutgers university for example a unique course titled  crossnational communication  was developed to introduce graduate students from a variety of specialization areas to basic research on the role of information exchange and data transfer in transnational and cross cultural processes however the extent to which new courses should be developed to implement multiculturalism effectively is a decision that library and information science programs will make differently depending among other things on the size and specific focus of the program budgetary constraints and the availability of trained staff conclusion educating in a multicultural context is certainly a challenge in that it involves rethinking the fundamental assumptions about knowledge and about how we teach however multiculturalism beyond its prag volume  number
