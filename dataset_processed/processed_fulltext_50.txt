faculty and student perceptions of distance education using television daniel d barron this paper includes a description of the evolution of the distance education efforts of the university of south carolina college of library and information science and the results of a study of the students who participated in those courses analysis of the data gathered indicated among others that there appear to be some differences in the various modes of instructional delivery in the perceptions of the students and faculty but the benefits of distance education especially using telecommunications technology is a viable alternative for the delivery of library and information science education the purpose of this article is to present background information related to the use of telecommunications for instructional delivery by the university of south carolina college of library and information science clis and to report on one study of its apparent effectiveness in the literature searches for information to help the clis faculty make decisions regarding the use of telecommunications and in preparation for this article the author was surprised by the lack of information available related to the decision making processes in our library and information science education programs the case study presented here while it does not represent a systematic description of all of the various elements that make up the decision making process is an effort to provide for both a report of the evaluation of a specific element of one program as well as information related to the conception and evolution of that element within the program daniel d barron is an associate professor and coordinator of the school library media program university of south carolina college of library and information science columbia sc  spring  
journal of education for library and information science background in spring  the college offered libr j sharing literature with young children using open circuit television this telecourse was developed and produced by the college under the title jump over the moon sharing literature with young children see preceding article by pamela barron in this issue in fall  the college offered libr  foundations of information sources and services using interactive television these were the first courses in what has become a regular part of the college response to the distant learner in south carolina since then the college has offered more than  for credit courses which have involved more than  individual students at the time of this writing the college provides two interactive televised classes over a statewide closed circuit system each semester and two telecourses over statewide open circuit television each semester in addition to the televised classes the college has produced statewide teleconferences on censorship library automation and school library media center scheduling the faculty have participated also in three other teleconferences sponsored by the south carolina state department of education on copyright and microcomputer software evaluation need for distance education program the need for some sort of awayfrom the home campus response to the initial and continuing education needs of people in the state was evident almost from the founding of the college this need resulted from the desires of women and men who were well qualified and greatly interested in completing the master degree renewing their certificates as school library media specialists and participating in organized continued learning experiences but whose family and job related concerns prevented them from attending the columbia campus on a regular basis many of these individuals were practicing librarians who wanted the knowledge and financial advantages resulting from an advanced degree and continuing education since many of these persons were employed in jobs that were relatively inflexible during the regular work day and since they had other family and personal demands on their time even the availability of evening and summer classes on the columbia campus was not sufficient to meet their needs the needs expressed by these men and women represented the same needs expressed by groups in our society that a number of authors have pointed out must be taken into consideration by leaders in higher education if they hope to meet their own social responsibilities to those interested adults as well as to enjoy the benefits that come from those adults participation directly in higher education diversity by design was an important text at the time of the college decision making and remains an important work for all of those in higher education planning for a future among the many concerns and issues addressed by the carnegie com volume  number 
faculty and student perceptions mission on higher education that are not yet resolved faculty response the faculty responded by offering courses on an irregular basis at sites other than the columbia campus but there was a need for a more carefully planned program that would include the major population centers in the state on a faculty vote in  it was decided to take selected courses to sites around the state these courses were to be delivered in traditional classroom settings this was well received by the students and both faculty and students agreed that the academic quality of the courses was high enough to continue the efforts for the first few years faculty taught these courses on an overload basis but since  all courses have been taught within the regular teaching loads of the faculty there were two major problems encountered in the distance education efforts the first of course was the limited number of resources available to the students away from the good collections in the columbia campus library the decision was made early that the college would offer courses away from the columbia campus which used the same syllabi made the same demands on students and required the same resources as the courses taught on the columbia campus the college promised delivery of the class  not the course  to the local site in other words the faculty would bring classes to the students at more convenient locations and times than those on the columbia campus and would make every effort to provide resources locally to support the class the student however had to and still must realize that some resources must be retrieved personally through interlibrary loan or by traveling to a library whose collection supports the instruction every effort was and is made by the college to eliminate the old criticism of extension courses where courses are tailored to the availability of local resources more than to the knowledge and skill demands of the courses intended purposes fortunately the university offers excellent support services to the faculty the units within the university that support the academic programs in their efforts to provide for the distant learner include graduate regional studies office of telecommunications instruction the instructional services center and the library processing center graduate regionali studies and the office of telecommunications instruction provide logistical services and some limited finances to purchase unique resources for the specific sites at which a class is delivered the instructional services center provides the technical expertise including studios and the full range of production and consultation services needed for telecommunications delivery the library processing center whose title describes poorly what has become a vital information and materials switching center provides interlibrary loan and other networking services to libraries that support classes located on the nine campuses of the university it must be noted here that there is a developing interest among many librarians related to the service of off campus populations in fact a series of conferences have been undertaken within spring  
journal of education for library and information science the past few years to facilitate those interested in this topic as well as the development of a discussion group within the association for college and research libraries several members of the library processing center have participated in these events even with this fine support students then and now find it necessary to come to the columbia campus to complete some assignments but these visits can be planned for weekends or evenings which may allow for safer travel and more convenience for students as they coordinate work and study schedules few students are more than two and ahalf hours from columbia so the burden is not so great especially considering that they have the class delivered more locally and that they need to travel to the columbia campus only a few times this is in comparison with having to attend classes for  weeks one day each week at the columbia campus usually at night and having to return there on another day or night of the same week to complete assignments the second problem encountered was the limited time in any given semester during which faculty could take a full day to travel to a remote site conduct class have local office hours and still maintain their responsibilities on the columbia campus this made the college efforts seem unfair to some students and in fact to the faculty the fiscal rewards for faculty initially came from the overload salary they were able to collect however with the decision to keep all teaching within the regular load no additional money was available this compounded the problem the promise of television delivery was suggested as the college faculty wrestled with the idea of using television as a delivery medium for graduate courses many factors were taken into consideration the availability of technology was not an issue since the university has access to very sophisticated systems that have been used by its various colleges including education engineering business administration and social work to deliver courses and in limited instances whole graduate degree programs also the office of telecommunications instruction was available to the faculty the office promotes the courses and provides for logistical support including registration mailing of textbooks and syllabi photoduplication and tollfree telephone access to faculty by students in addition the office provides faculty with counseling in instructional design and media utilization review of the literature a review of the literature available at the time the faculty was involved in the decision making process revealed only two articles that reported the activities of other library and information science programs in telecommunications one by bruce shuman describes the use of closed circuit television for one course at one school that school by the way continues its use of televised instruction the other by jill may describes some of the developments and evaluations of a videotaped course in children media two articles by wender and  volume  number 
faculty and student perceptions berk describe uses of telecommunications technology in other aspects of continuing education since the initial literature search only one additional article by darlene weingand has appeared which reports on the use of telecommunications in library and information science education the initial literature review revealed relatively few articles or reports of studies however those that were available were very positive and offered a number of suggestions and conclusions that were useful to the college since then a number of studies and reviews in the literature of such related areas as adult learning instructional media utilization and higher education for adults have supported the concept of using telecommunications to deliver instruction the classic study by evans published in  with a follow up in  provided invaluable insight into the nature of faculty responses to the use of television as a delivery medium the study included descriptions of the decision making process and the psychological barriers encountered in using technology another study by rockhill has been published since the original literature search in  and deserves attention by any academic unit or institution intending to develop a distance education program generally the literature suggested that teleconferences have become commonly accepted events in higher education efforts to provide for the continued learning needs of its clients but televised delivery of classes especially in graduate education are considered with more hesitation and suspicion by some educators the use of innovative methods or new delivery technologies by community colleges undergraduate programs and in efforts to reach adult nontraditional audiences enjoy a considerably positive portrayal and have been shown to be both academically and societally valuable graduate education on the other hand has not been a major focus of most nontraditional efforts to reach beyond the central campus conversations with faculty in other units of the university that were already involved in telecommunications instruction were favorable also these early conversations have led to what has become a universitywide support group that provides informal opportunities for instructors to share ideas concerns and techniques the group also provides a forum for discussion and debate which has lead to advocacy for the university distance education efforts currently this informal group includes the colleges of education social work public health nursing and library and information science as an important secondary benefit to the college the process of using telecommunications has contributed greatly to the college visibility and networking among these other academic units in the system implementation of courses dirr has pointed out that the major barriers to the use of television are  lack of money to support the effort  lack spring  
journal of education for library and information science of faculty commitment to the use of the medium and  lack of trained support staff since the university telecommunications system was in place with a highly trained technical support staff available and a highly committed logistical support staff offering their services and since the system and its staff were available free of charge to the college the only remaining element was faculty commitment the college was founded on the basis of innovation in education and has enjoyed a generally open minded and risk taking faculty therefore the notion of trying something fairly radical was not a great issue since the mode of delivery was essentially untested the major concern of the faculty was the same as for any new course or other innovation making sure that the intellectual and academic integrity be maintained the decision to offer the telecourse sharing literature with young children  had been approved by the faculty but the decision to use television to deliver information as in a traditional classroom seemed to be a much more difficult one it should be noted here that there was reluctance on the part of some faculty to commit themselves to the concept and considerable debate among the faculty preceded the decision but when the decision was made all offered their support the first course selected for interactive television was the required course libr     foundations of information sources and services   it was decided that since the course was presented in the traditional classroom primarily using lecture and demonstration it lent itself well to the capabilities of the studio classroom the three on campus day long sessions built into the course provided the opportunity for such learning experiences as discussion groups and practice of the reference interview also it would reach a very diverse student population that would therefore provide a great deal of data to support or reject offering additional courses from that time to the present every course offered via telecommunications has been treated the same as courses taught in the traditional classroom  the same syllabi assignments grading procedure requirements and end of term evaluations were and are used with each course both required and elective courses have been offered using interactive television including microcomputer use in school libraries research methods selection of nonbook media administration collection development a school library media professional recertification seminar introduction to bibliographic control and introduction to information technology a computer literacy telecourse produced by the annenbergcpb project is offered as a community service course through the college the children literature course mentioned earlier is offered each fall and spring semester selected courses offered via telecommunications have been monitored a bit more closely than others in the catalog the first course libr  was very closely monitored by the faculty and by a study  volume  number 
faculty and student perceptions team of students under the direction of the faculty person teaching research methods during that semester comparisons of grades on projects examinations papers attitudes and perceptions were made between studio on campus students and television off campus students no statistically significant differences were found among any of the variables only  of the  total class members felt that the college should not continue to offer courses via television these  students were a part of the  who took the course on the campus and in the studio both expressed feelings similar to what shuman referred to as being  aguely victimized guinea pigs in an experiment since then comparisons have been made of final grades midterm grades grades on assignments resources used to complete assignments a bibliometric study of student papers and a wide range of demographic data related to students participating in the courses these demographic data include whether the students were partor full time on campus or in the television classroom their scores on entrance examinations their gpa before entrance to the college and others the comparisons have proved to be very consistent  there were no statistically significant differences among the variables selected for study aversa warns us though potentially exciting and useful to program planners action research is not truly evaluation nor is monitoring evaluation in the strictest sense   these data are important however and represent at least the same level of evaluation to which most traditional classroom activities are subjected true experimental designs for research related to the college use of telecommunications have been suggested by different faculty and students but many factors have prevented them from being carried out to this point what has been done however beyond the amassment of a student data file is described below study methodology in spring  a survey instrument was sent to a random sample of  students taken from a list of the  who had taken distance courses from the college since spring  excluded from this list were those having taken the computer literacy course since that course cannot be counted toward the master degree in library and information science faculty who had taught these courses were interviewed as well the purpose of the project was to gather data on the perceptions of all those involved in the distance education program of the college with respect to academic quality problems issues to be addressed and relative effectiveness of the efforts a total of  usable responses from students was analyzed for comparisons respondents were added to indicate whether they had taken class work on the columbia campus as well as at another site   or   had and whether they had taken columbia campus classes as well as spring

faculty and student perceptions feelings and other social functions in the class robin moss points out that one of the problems associated with distant learning is the lack of social and emotional support provided by the conventional teacherandclass adult learners tend to lack confidence and to lose heart easily distance learning can be a lonely experience also as shuman pointed out in his  study feelings of inhibition frustration or detachment were common to all students in the televised course while such feelings were almost totally absent in conventional classroom students table  contains information related to the respondents perceptions of various class elements based on their overall experiences in the college to the time of the questionnaire table  contains information related to the comparison of various class elements among the delivery modes by respondents who indicated that they had taken at least one course on the table   respondents  rankings of class elements based on their overall experience in courses in the college percent of responses element    amount of instructor contact     quality of instructor contact     amount of peer contact     quality of peer contact     comfort in asking questions     comfort in class discussions     availability of resources     depending upon the wording of the question the ranking was  to  high to low with ample to nonexistent very good to very poor and very comfortable to very un comfortable used in the text n   table  respondents comparisons of on site or television class elements with columbia campus class elements percent of responses about no better same worse opinion element os tv os tv os tv os tv amount of contact         quality of contact         comfort in questioning         comfort in discussions         persons gotten to know         unity or groupness         involved in course         discussion after class         peer support group         available resources         enjoyed course         os  on site classroom respondents n   tv  television classroom respondents n   spring  
journal of education for library and information science columbia campus in addition to one or more using the other delivery modes contact with faculty as the tables indicate the amount and quality of the respondents contact with faculty appear to be relatively good or about the same as their experiences in courses on the columbia campus in an effort to identify the reasons behind the negative responses two possible explanations emerged data gathered from follow up telephone interviews seem to indicate that students prefer more traditional classroom contacts with the instructor and if they have the opportunity would prefer to attend classes in a traditional classroom at a local site or on the columbia campus this appears to be a major reason for the negative reactions to the questionnaire  an affirmation of the traditional rather than so much a negative comment on the innovative there appear to be no perceptions of significant barriers to the informationtransfer process however among most of the students it must be pointed out also that the questionnaire was distributed during a course in which a significant number of difficulties and concerns were expressed by the students a total of  of the respondents were in that course and almost without exception accounted for the negative responses to the questionnaire the reasons for these negative responses are beyond the scope of the present study but suffice it to say that what appears to be an anomaly if course evaluations and informal contacts with students are to be considered will be the focus of future research and monitoring by the administration and faculty questions and class discussions the negative responses in the area of students asking questions and class discussions especially related to television may be a factor of the technology its distinct difference from the traditionail classroom and the demands on the student to speak into a telephone or microphone johnson suggests that other psychological barriers may inhibit distance learners from asking questions and participating in discussions but there is no doubt that some are inhibited by the technology itself again follow up telephone conversations with students seem to support the notion that the negative experience they were involved in at the time of the questionnaire had a distinct impact on their responses throughout the questionnaire involvement and peer support respondents were asked to characterize the social environment of the class by indicating the extent to which they felt involved in the course the extent to which a group feeling emerged from the class and the extent to which they felt peer support groups were developed during the course follow up telephone interviews provided information that seems to support the basic premise stated earlier that students would prefer the contact of peers as well as instructors in a more traditional classroom but the interviews also indicated that the students felt that information transfer was not hampered significantly  volume  number 
faculty and student perceptions concerning groupness ie  feelings about being a member of the class a part of the college a part of the university the interviews brought out the fact that most of those who indicated that television classes tended to develop this trait less were in the telecourse in which they met as a group on the columbia campus only three times such things as class groupness or unity under such circumstances were not really possible two students pointed out that the question included the words in comparison they were forced to indicate less because they had participated in the previous summer sessions on the columbia campus and had exceptionally enjoyable classes therefore a comparison in honesty could only indicate less groupness although they felt that the television classes had at least the same groupness as other traditional classes in which they had participated the college advocates the development of peer support groups with the yet to be tested notion that this could facilitate local networking among libraries of a similar nature as well as multitype cooperatives the reason for the apparently better rating in this area by television class students has not yet been isolated nor have the negative responses been explained availability of resources one of the major concerns of faculty that several researchers have pointed out in the literature of distance education is the availability of resources to complete assignments a possible explanation for the negative response in this area that was revealed in the interviews is that instructors in the college make the same assignments for all classes that carry the same title and course number in other words students sometimes had to travel to several different libraries or to columbia to complete assignments because the resources to complete the assignments were available only at these locations also the course most frequently taken by students by television is a course in early childhood literature often mentioned as a problem by students in course evaluations as well as the interviews for this project is the difficulty they have in getting children books for their reading and project assignments this seems to point to the fact that many of our libraries public and school especially have relatively poor collections of materials for this age group a point that has received a great deal of attention recently by public officials in the state the increased awareness of the problem and the need for solutions can be traced with a fair degree of certainty to the students who participated in the classes other questions related to the use of visual materials and relative effectiveness of the instructor were asked and respondents tended to indicate that these were generally the same among the three delivery systems respondents were asked to indicate their relative enjoyment of the courses compared to courses having been taken on the columbia campus a total of  of the respondents indicated that they enjoyed onspring  
journal of education for library and information science site courses and  television delivered courses more than those on the columbia campus  enjoyed on site about the same and  enjoyed television about the same enjoyment was less for  of the on site respondents and  for the television courses when asked if television delivery were not available whether the student would continue or have continued in her or his course work in the college  said they would  said they would not and  indicated that they were not sure whether they would or not analysis showed that  of the respondents would continue course work even if no distance education efforts were made by the college  would not and  were not sure respondents were asked if they would encourage others to take courses from the college  indicated that they would with only  indicating that they would not others would be encouraged to take locally delivered courses of the college by  of the respondents and   indicated that they would encourage others to take courses delivered by television when asked how the college should plan for the use of television in the future  of the respondents indicated that its use should be increased  that it be decreased  that it be maintained at the current level and  had not strong feelings one way or the other it appears from the telephone interviews that the last group represents those persons who were taking advantage of the courses for recertification only several of whom plan to retire before having to take additional course work faculty interviews as with any academic program the quality of distance education through telecommunications or in the traditional classroom depends mostly on the quality of the faculty ability and on their commitment to the program quality is assumed in this report by the bias of the author and the results of the processes of faculty evaluations the commitment in the college is fairly obvious of the nine full time faculty in the college four have been responsible for the development and implementation of one or more interactive television courses two others have made major contributions to classes but they have as yet not offered a course alone seven have taught one or more courses on site at a location other than the columbia campus all of those who had taught using television up to spring  were asked to list their major concerns problems successes and any issues they felt should be included in an in depth study of the distance education program most responded with lists that are summarized below all were contacted by the writer and in most instances more in depth conversations took place generally the feelings toward meeting the needs of the people served by the university in this professional area and discipline were strong almost all expressed the idea that they would prefer the ideal of students having the opportunity to take the time to pursue full time study on the  volume  number 
faculty and student perceptions columbia campus the personali life concerns of students however should be taken into consideration several persons expressed concern for having to take time from other obligations especially research to travel in addition several classes both those taught on the columbia campus and those taught using television have gotten very large that also contributes to the same concerns for distributing faculty time among the responsibilities and interests held as far as television as a delivery medium is concerned faculty members made several points it was and remains a new and different experience that takes a considerable effort to use well some in fact reported an almost uncontrollable fear of being in front of the camera a few seem to enjoy the experience while others find it to be very demanding some reported that they have had a tendency to go into the studio classroom with more notes and generally a more tightly organized presentation than they do in the traditional classroom in fact the classroom versions of their notes are often covered more rapidly when using them with the teleconferencing mode this could be explained in terms of the teachers feeling a bit more apprehensive about the television cameras being present it could also be a function of the students asking fewer questions or fewer class discussions unfortunately a conjecture that there are fewer questions and less discussion in televised classes has not yet been proved or disproved since data related to traditional classroom questions and discussion are not available some faculty seem to believe that this is the case however other faculty who have had more opportunities in the television classroom report that with some effort and a little creativity class discussions can be held profitably some faculty have expressed the notion that they do not like the confined feeling of the television studio classroom and prefer being able to move more freely about the room the extent to which this has an impact of faculty performance or student learning is another area for which data are not readily available some faculty expressed the idea that they used more visuali materials notes and graphics with the overhead camera and used more videotapes than in the traditional classroom because it is easier to have the technical staff show these than it is for the teacher to show them in the traditional classroom the single most critical problem expressed by faculty was concern for the size of the classes one person pointed out that the quality of the instruction was not an immediate question the individuals in the large classes until now have gotten the same quality education as if the classes were on the columbia campus the question asked was  ut how long can the faculty hold out the additional time spent by faculty in making sure that each student gets the attention she or he needs cuts deeply into other areas as reported above also the additional time and effort spring  
journal of education for library and information science could lead to  urnout or perhaps melt down only one faculty person so far has had large classes from one semester to the next semester on a fairly regular basis the technology itself was a source of frustration for some technology has a tendency to break down since so many people are involved in one class production communication and technical assistance breakdowns are possible with the experiences being new and different any breakdown may be viewed as a disaster and cause the feeling that it happens all the time in fact the down time of the system is very small as is shown by the records of the studio the talk back system while sophisticated and representing the state of the art presents a problem for both questions and discussion in classes that tend to rely heavily on lecture and demonstration however this is a rather minor point the office of telecommunications instruction provides student assistants to stuff envelopes and do mailing for the faculty teaching in the televised classes but sometimes the mail refuses to cooperate as assignments are moved from students to faculty and back to students again currently the possibility of using electronic mail is under consideration but until it is used correspondence remains somewhat of a problem conclusion i ust as one who makes a clearing in the forest is increasing the periphery of contact with the unknown we are only becoming wiser about the scope of the territory we have yet to explore   the college has cleared some territory in distance education and the use of technology to meet the educational needs of library and information professionals in south carolina there appears to be a great deal of success in the efforts and both students and teachers are satisfied with the results to date academic quality especially as judged in comparison with existing standards are acceptable and effectiveness as judged by the notions of academic quality accessibilty to students and faculty time is also acceptable there is a newness and a difference that must be explored further the whole nature of the socialization process into the profession as a function of the initial education program needs to be examined included in this is the notion of peer support groups and their impact on cooperatives outside the academic setting the dynamics of student interaction in the traditional classroom and its importance to the total learning environment requires additional study the college faculty is committed to the idea of distance education and telecommunications as a mode for its delivery the students while tending to prefer the traditional classroom under many circumstances are also committed to those same ideas both groups seem to accept the fact that they are dealing with a developing technology that has shortcomings but also promise difficulties but greater potential many demands but several rewards not everyone enjoys it or is totally convinced that it is as good as the traditional classroom but so few data are  volume  number
