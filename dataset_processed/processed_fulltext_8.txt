a unpacking library posters a theoretical approach nancy r thomas this paper explores the semiotic aspects of poster graphics observed as furnishings in selected libraries specifically the paper analyzes the poster series produced and marketed by the american library association ala as advertisements to promote reading and library use and considers how the behavior exhibited in these commercial scenes creates a discourse and subject positions that may ultimately be disconfirming for some library users the theoretical framework for the study draws on a constitutive view of communication which acknowledges the construction of knowledge and identity in interaction within social situations within this framework foucault theory of discursive formation makes it possible to understand poster graphics as discursive practice while scheff theory of the social bond draws attention to the unforeseen consequences for both library users and library professionals of the world view created by such posters unpacking library posters a theoretical approach concern for the experience of the user in interaction with information systems lies at the heart of contemporary research in library and information studies lis as explained by dervin and nilan and evident in the work of kuhlthau belkin and others this approach represents a significant departure from previous approaches which gave primary research attention to information systems and the ways in which information resources were represented organized stored and retrieved this shift in focus is explicit in a study by mokros mullins and saracevic who sought to investigate social dimensions of interactions between users and reference librarians conducting an online search these theorists concluded that in interactions with users library professionals express not only theories of professional practice but also theories of personhood which include how librarians regard library users and themselves exploring service encounters as communicative interaction is also evident in the research of radford and chelton while chelton explored interactions as part of the give and take of reference services to adolescents in school media centers radford considered the importance of nonverbal communication as a relational dimension in service encounters in academic library settings although the physical environment both frames communicative events and provides situational clues for interactional participants in terms of agency and institutional values and valuing library environments have seldom been the subject of systematic research however in an exploratory study of selected school public and academic  volume  number

 journal of education for library and information science constructed corporate creations made to seem natural or essential through media conditioning of public perception noting the variety and complexity of meaning in advertising barthels study considered the process of objectification of women in advertisements as embedded in a web of cultural currents symbols and processes which makes it more difficult to free one thinking from the hold that a gendered valuing of external appearance has on the public and individual psyche for this reason barthels sought to understand the social function of gendered images in advertising through a multitheoretical framework of particular value for barthels analysis was baudrillard model which framed media consumption in terms of psychoanalytic conceptualizations of identification projection transcendence power sexuality and the sociological notions of status and prestige in media studies stuart hall also posited advertisements as polysemous texts the interpretation of which depends on the social situation of the viewer for example hall suggested that those who are most closely aligned with the dominant ideology will most likely produce dominant readings of a given text while those whose social situation places them outside the mainstream culture will produce oppositional readings readers and viewers whose social experience places them someplace between these two positions will modify or inflect the meanings of the text to meet the needs of their specific situation like barthels both kilbourne and goffman have also studied gender issues in advertisements their particular concern is not so much in what is being sold overtly in media representations as in their unintended consequences  those ideas about themselves other people and the social context that people take away from an encounter with ads for example in gender advertisements goffman explores the limited subject positions created for women through depictions of female behavior of particular interest to the present analysis is goffman identification of techniques such as posture gesture and clothing that differentiate and stratify representations of roles and behavior in advertisements along gender and class lines for her part kilbourne studies have raised awareness of the ramifications of sexism in advertising particularly the objectification of women and the negative impact of this objectification on meaningful relationships and self esteem because the techniques used by commercial advertisers are employed in ala promotional posters the works of the theorists reviewed here have particular relevance to the present analysis as will be seen the posters displayed texts that should not be dismissed as neutral backdrops that engage or fail to engage a user in some aesthetic response on the contrary they constitute a semiotically loaded communicative moment when library users experience the generalized other the experience of which involves an understanding of the self within the situation research questions this paper aims to deconstruct ala produced library posters as privileged discourse in which sociocultural assumptions values and symbols are embedded specifically this study addresses the following questions what values and traditions are reflected in the majority of ala graphics posters observed at study site libraries and how are they expressed discursively what subject positions do these media texts make possible and conceal finally what are the possible consequences for library users and librarians who engage with these posters volume  number 
unpacking library posters  theoretical framework the analysis of library posters presented in this paper is theoretically grounded in a constitutive view of communication as articulated in the recent work of mokros et al and mokros and deetz a constitutive view of communication recognizes knowledge as created interactively by social participants within a moment of engagement this view differs significantly from the information model of communication proposed by shannon and weaver which considers communication instrumentally as a tool people use in making connections with one another and as a process wherein a speaker sends an informational message through a designated channel to one or more listeners within an information model the major concerns center on clarity of the channel and the message and the effects of messages on listeners a constitutive view of communication by contrast focuses primarily on meanings  which do not inhere in messages or exist as products of individual cognitive activity but arise instead within communicative moments constructed through engagement with others within this understanding language is necessarily arbitrary and contextual the subjectively shared experience of the world that it describes can be constructed only communicatively an important tenet of communication from a constitutive perspective is that a sense of who one is does not exist a priori but is constituted through language within communicative moments which taken together create a fabric of experience that encompasses both one personal history and future expectations the analysis also reflects foucault theory of discursive formation which allows the researcher to consider experienced reality as it is formed discursively as well as the assumptions and ideological values which are embedded in institutionally sanctioned practices policies texts and artifacts foucault uses the term discursive formation to encompass systems of discursive statements objects and concepts organized into five mutually reinforcing units practices rules roles knowledge and power because they are so explicitly discursive according to foucault definition ala poster graphics function as texts in the same ways as do more conventional linguistically based social practices scheff s theory of the social bond offers a theoretical frame for considering the potential ramifications or consequences for users in engaging with these discursive practices according to scheff all social engagements are experienced as a continuous series of interactive moments in which an individual feels either pride in the acceptance validation and positive regard displayed by social others or embarrassment or shame in the face of disapproval exclusion or rejection scheffs theory contributes to an understanding not only of how external experience may be internalized and used in the construction of a self within a given communicative encounter but also of how encounters with physical aspects of the social context can be construed as constituting an experience of the larger social sphere in which all such encounters are necessarily embedded thus in the present instance foucault theory of discursive formation is construed as a constitutive theory of communication at an institutional and social level while scheff theory of the social bond acts as a constitutive theory of communication at the level of individual identity creation such a framework makes interaction the keystone of inquiry by displacing the concern for systems collections and programming that represent the leitmotif winter 
 journal of education for library and information science of traditional approaches to library research through the combination of these theoretical frameworks the following analysis seeks to add to the research initiatives of frohmann mokros et al radford and chelton in applying communication theory to professional activities in a variety of library contexts method the data analyzed in this paper were collected as part of a comprehensive exploration of facilities in selected libraries in  method for the original study was anchored in assumptions of the interpretive paradigm informed by the social construction of reality theory of berger and luckmann and conducted according to the grounded theory model described by glaser and strauss while precedents for applying a phenomenological approach to investigations of environmental experiences in everyday settings come from research in education environmental psychology and geography the research design was based on the first three steps of scheffs fourstage morphology model scheff suggests that research in natural settings should begin with the preliminary exploration of a single case followed by a microscopic exploration of several specimen cases in studies in which an explication or deconstruction of meanings is of importance the researcher becomes by virtue of his or her status as a user of signs an important participant in the critical process for this reason ethnographic methodologies are considered particularly useful research observations were conducted in two public urban and suburban libraries school library media centers in an elementary a middle and a high school in a suburban district and a k  school in an urban district nearby the decision to observe these sites was aimed not at providing a representative sample of libraries but rather at exploring specific environments available to a variety of potential library users within a single geographic region as with other kinds of exploratory studies in which purposive samples are part of the research design no claims to generalizability of research findings to other contexts are made rather the researcher sought to report what was deemed worthy of others attention in terms of issues and problems that warrant further study data this paper presents an analysis of the seventeen ala read posters and four kids who read succeed posters on display at four of the six libraries included in the original study see tables  and  although a variety of other kinds of ala produced posters were also observed in study site libraries the read and readsucceed series were included in this analysis because these series were the ones most often observed n or  percent of the total number produced under the aegis of the ala these posters exemplified privileged discourse within foucault definition details of specific posters observed at study site libraries were confirmed through an examination of advertisements for the posters in an ala graphics catalog examples of the ala read series observed consisted of  x  frameless full color or black and white portraits of well known entertainers and sports figures each celebrity was photographed holding a book the word read appears in large capital letters across the top of the poster with the celebrity subject seated or standing below in each poster a caption appears volume  number

 journal of education for library and information science many of the ala posters present people of color they fail to portray any lifestyles other than those that embody white middle class cultural traditions a particularly striking example of what might be considered the hegemonic acculturation of viewers to angloamerican traditions is the read poster that features the baseball star bo jackson jackson is shown sitting on a carpeted floor in front of a brick fireplace a traditional symbol of middle class status and stability with baseball equipment denoting action as well as a profession reading the old man and the sea an american literary classic a western reading of this poster would consider the material objects as signifiers of status and wealth in a message that claims that successful athletes like to read good books an oppositional reading might find in the message a suggestion that the adoption of the cultural trappings and literary tastes of middle class euro american society are prerequisites to success and what library users should do to the extent that such a representation appears to valorize or celebrate people of color principally for having made it in the white world ramsey argues that the possibility exists that other cultural traditions may be effectively undermined and devalued even by those for whom alternative cultural patterns are actually a norm discussion as the traditional voice of the library profession ala has been a leader in support of equity issues and literacy initiatives in both their mission statements and their public pronouncements for this reason it was ironic to discover that the images and values expressed in promotional items that ala itself produces and that librarians presumably find both useful and appropriate express values that may well contradict and subvert these basic concerns and while it can be argued that the inclusion of minority celebrities and references to minority authors represent efforts to reclaim minority voice and promote minority use of libraries the narrow range of cultural traditions presented as well as the manner of minority representation leave claims to genuine inclusivity open to question indeed the matching of minority authors and titles to minority subjects in celebrity posters suggests subordination and separation rather than parity and inclusion cortese suggests that the equal presentation model in advertising is one common way in which advertisers include minorities in the promotion of an idea or a commodity this model features whites and minorities  in exactly the same way regardless of any cultural economic or physical differences such an approach when it effectively suppresses meaningful differences silences alternative voices and marginalizes alternative viewpoints such practices seemed to be suggested in the standardized messages of the read posters for as deetz explains the juxtaposition of a ubiquitous and redundant message and the appearance of human agency together serve both to silence individual voices and to mask the ideological producer of the message in a profession that is as feminized as librarianship is in the united states the possibilities for gender inequity implied in the perpetuation of gender stereotypes in library posters are striking theorists with a special interest in youth issues have written extensively of the destructive power of media presentations and life experiences that undermine the development of young girls as active and independent social agents in this sense in the failure of posters to provide media models of activity and strength ala misses an opportunity to volume  number 
unpacking library posters  disrupt socialization patterns that according to pipher contribute to the depression obsession and self destructive behavior that all too often accompany young girls into middle school and beyond what libraries gain and lose by coopting icons of popular culture as symbols of library use in ways that at least arguably perpetuate stereotypes detrimental to women and minorities are issues that ought to provoke professional interest and discussion because of their ubiquity and the redundancy of their messages and format it seems likely the presence of library posters may have receded from conscious awareness therefore the value systems that they seem to represent may contribute to what boykin and ellison call tacit conditioning of climates in which distancing subordination invalidation and disconfirmation of some library users is likely to occur after all it is easy to justify withholding resources and services from a population that is considered unworthy according to hill for example the proliferation of negative stereotypes for youth and minorities tends to promote fear of minority youth which leads to reluctance of people to hire them wait on them or provide services for them stereotypes and enculturation themes have a similar impact on minority youngsters in particular the possible reinforcement of views widely shared among minority youngsters that library use specifically as well as other kinds of educational activities constitute acting white or doing the anglo thing indeed fordham and ogbu suggest that it is just this sort of image that causes adolescents of color to reject as culturally inappropriate the pursuit of academic goals in general and library use in particular to the extent that presenting images that construct library users in western cultural ways ensures the nonparticipation of minority youth some ala posters may produce consequences that are the exact opposite of what may have been intended by the same token arguing that poverty and violence are individual problems that can be overcome by literacy is to provide a simple answer to an extremely complex problem while essentially ignoring the structures of hierarchy and power as well as inequality in the distribution of resources and access to knowledge in contemporary society a discourse that locates the cause of poverty and ignorance in the individual may in fact preclude a discussion of their social causes in its implied constitution of nonreaders as social deviants at best and as irrational urban miscreants at worst the values expressed in the gangbuster poster tend to legitimate a social structure within which those who ought to legitimately exercise control are constituted by referencing those who have difficulty controlling themselves according to both gans and mokros and deetz it is in this way that the dominant culture reinforces its own feelings of superiority and biases at the expense of people who for whatever reason do not exhibit the same kinds of behaviors directions for research and implications for theory development in us it is hoped that by viewing library posters as elements in a discursive formation those who make environmental choices for libraries schools and service agencies may develop a sensitivity to and an understanding of the processes through which dominant ideologies are produced and reproduced on a daily basis in commercial graphics future research studies might consider a more comprehensive examination of all the ala read posters that have been winter
