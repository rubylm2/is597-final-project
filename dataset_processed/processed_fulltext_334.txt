information anxiety from the undergraduate student perspective  is best described as the range of anxiety fear nervousness confusion etc someone experiences when attempting to identify define and satisfy an information need especially when that person must use the library andor its resources such as reference services to satisfy that need gross et al  gross et al  onwucgbuzic jiao  bostick  van kampcn  based on late thcarly   st century additions of information technology to libraries it is a logical step to include the impact of information technology from the use of word processing software to learning how to use academic research databases on library anxiety in undergraduate students the combination of information technology and library anxiety in undergraduate students has been studied specifically by kwon et al  and van kampen  as well as generally by becker  jcrabek et al  jiao et al  and kalbach  however despite numerous adaptations and additions to bostick original library anxiety scale    jiao et al   onwucgbuzie et al  to include information technology components and concerns in relation to information anxiety in undergraduate students detailed above very few of these studies explain appropriately where in their information seeking students believe they feel higher levels of information anxiety or how they believe this anxiety impacts them during their information search process primarily and in regard to their academic performance overall previous research in this area puts forth that a link exists between heightened information anxiety and decreased academic performance gross et al  grosse al  kuhlthau  kwon  kwon et al  nicholas et al  orien et al  roscllc  but what specifically incites or heightens such anxiety is understudied as was mentioned earlier the library anxiety scale has been adapted previously by other researchers examining various facets of   st century information seeking computer usage multimodal research etc for this pilot study the adaptation added elements related specifically to information technology both hardware such as computers and software such as online research databases and information seeking in general and made sure these elements were consistently worded with the rest of the scale the purpose of this pilot study was to preliminarily test the adapted scale with a select group of respondents ie all second semester freshmen in all iterations of a traditional and a remedial first year english course at a major public university in ohio to aid the researchers in exploring ways to strengthen the scale for a larger study in the future additionally the researchers examined where statistical significance registered in the pilot study findings to inform future research in the area of information anxiety in undergraduate students literature review for those who study the information seeking processes of undergraduate students in the united states it has been discovered repeatedly that uncertainty and anxiety are common factors in the process as was discussed earlier it has also been established that when uncertainty and anxiety are heightened either through frustration or lack of ability in this area information seekers either satisfice in their information seeking ie claim satisfaction with minimal or poor resources or abandon a search for information altogether becker  gross et al  gross et al   kalbach  orien et al   prabha et al  indeed anxiety in general is something that has been identified by seminal researchers in the field of the information seeking process as being the biggest impediment to successful completion of information tasks bclkin   dcrvin  kuhlthau  in terms of the necessary information literacy and critical thinking skills required
