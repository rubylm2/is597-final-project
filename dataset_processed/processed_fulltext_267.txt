the relation of subject interests to actual reading t nhe normal situation in any community so far as we have been able to learn reveals a very wide discrepancy between what people read and what they prefer many different conditions determine how nearly a given reader reads what he wants hence a sensible plan of procedure is to find out what the relationship is between actual reading and desired reading then to study each of the conditions that affect this relationship the present paper undertakes to compare the subjects of most interest to particular groups of readers with the subjects upon which the same persons do most reading in newspapers magazines and books such comparisons suggest other conditions in addition to subject interest that largely determine the amount of satisfaction obtained from reading the more clearly such conditions can be defined and evaluated the more possible it becomes to satisfy the given readers by investigations such as this we should eventually determine what conditions may be so controlled as to increase the reader satisfaction with what he actually reads this is the common purpose of publishers and librarians if it be assumed that the reading desired by a group is both authentic and important the investigation may also be significant for educators political scientists and students of social welfare hence the work herein reported should not be regarded as of merely technical interest it may be helpful at this point to mention some of the conditions that make for satisfaction in reading such conditions very largely determine to what extent a given reader reads what he most wants furthermore such conditions will be found to range from those than can not usually be controlled as for example the particular subjects upon which the reader wishes information to the conditions that can be controlled 
subject interests and actual reading  as for example the accessibility of a given book or article in wide demand perhaps the most important of the conditions making for satisfaction in reading are those imposed by the reader himselfhis tastes his habits and his needs these are of course particularly difficult to control it is thus necessary to find out what they are and conform to them as closely as possible for this reason it is essential to determine first what people want to read about since a knowledge of the subjects discussed in contemporary literature that adults most want to read about is the necessary point of departure in any attempt to supply acceptable reading other preferences of the readersuch as preferences for certain authors for a particular style for treatments of a given length and the likemust also be determined if the reader is to be satisfied as completely as possible a second set of conditions is due to the nature of existing reading matter itself disappointment in reading results very frequently from the combination of an interesting subject and an uninteresting style recent studies of subject interest among readers have shown clearly that many of the subjects of most interest to certain groups are not represented in actual reading because congenial writing on the subjects is scarce readers of wide education who are interested in problems of child training for example are satisfied neither by the superficial scraps in newspaper columns nor by the technical treatises produced by psychological clinics they want something in between again readers of limited education who are interested in specific problems of economics or science can seldom find such subjects authoritatively treated in language that is clear and in a style that is pleasing the scope of treatment also has much to do with its readability magazine articles are too fragmentary for some readers interested in subjects that are treated almost exclusively in magazines whereas books are too ponderous for other readers interested in subjects that are almost exclusively treated in books a third group of conditions affecting the accessibility of reading matter is perhaps most significant of all since it determines
 the library quarterly whether the reader gets what he wants provided the reader knows what he wants and provided that such reading exists the accessibility of desired reading matter depends upon several conditions first in logical order it depends upon advertising unless the prospective reader learns of a given article or book he cannot of course take steps to secure it the book itself is to be sure the best sort of advertising the recommendations of friends paid advertising subject bibliographies and other forms of advertisements are needed to bring the reader in touch with more satisfactory reading than he encounters by mere chance other conditions affecting accessibility might be listed at considerable length such as the cost of reading matter the frequency of desired periodicals the library resources of home club and community the number and variety of bookstores and the conditions that determine how easy it is for the reader to seek out his reading such as time occupation and wealth at the risk of giving the appearance of definiteness and finality to what is indefinite and tentative the conditions affecting satisfaction in reading may be listed as follows i the reader preferences involving i desire to read on particular subjects  tastes regarding style authority length form appearance and other qualities of the reading matter  pleasure derived from reading as compared with other activities ii the nature of existing literature involving  the amount of writing upon preferred subjects s the literary merit of literature on such subjects readability  authenticity truthfulness scholarship or convincingness  the emphasis of other qualities affecting its appeal to different readers eg length form of publication printing appearance etc iii the availability of satisfying reading involving  amount and foym of advertising  the number and location of libraries and other sources from which reading matter may be borrowed io number and location of sources from which reading matter may be purchased i i cost of the reading desired
subect interests and actual reading  to list such conditions is enough to make clear the point of this introductory statement namely that what people would read if they could is not the same as what they actually read this is true because all of the eleven conditions mentioned are seldom entirely satisfactory to the reader reading that is entirely satisfactory to a given reader is limited in amount is not always known to exist and is seldom within easy reach some fortunate individuals either very wealthy persons of leisure or those within easy reach of good libraries do perhaps read much and read just about what they want most of the literate population does not the question then is what if anything can be done about it how may one proceed to increase the satisfactions obtainable from reading the answer we propose has three parts first we can separate the conditions that can not be directly controlled such as the reader desire to read on particular subjects from the conditions that can be controlled to some extent such as the appeal of the reading matter itself and its accessibility second we can find out for each of several typical groups of readers what sort of reading is defined by the conditions that cannot be controlled for example the fact that the given group of readers is most eager to read on particular subjects would help to define the reading desired when we know what the preferred subjects are the preference of the group for certain authors or for a certain style would further facilitate the selection of acceptable reading again the scope of treatment complexity of style extent of illustration and other qualities of the books preferred by each group can be determined to a degree that should approximate a useful definition of the reading matter that the group finds satisfactory at least in respect to purely informational material third we can modify certain other conditions to whatever extent is needed in order a to increase the supply of reading that meets the indicated demand and b to make it more accessible this assumes that the self interest of publishers may be relied upon to produce articles and books upon the desired
 the library quarterly topics and in the desired form when such desires are known for each group that the publishers aim to please it assumes further that librarians and other distributors of reading matter will improve their methods of distribution when the conditions have been identified that now make desired reading inaccessible to certain groups it is perhaps somewhat visionary to suggest that the program outlined in the foregoing paragraphs could ever or should ever be carried out in detail what is practicable however is a possibility rendered plausible by data presented in this report namely that three of the conditions mentioned are so much more influential than other conditions in their effects upon the satisfaction obtained from actual reading that the others may be disregarded for practical purposes if so the task of using the data would not be too difficult these conditions for the general reader are probably subject interest readability and accessibility all three may in time be sufficiently controlled to increase very considerably the amount of satisfactory literature available to various adult populations that is to say the material on the preferred subjects can be increased in amount its method of treatment can be better adjusted to the given readers and it can be more widely advertised such measures would increase the readers satisfaction since the correspondence between the subjects of most interest and the subjects most read about becomes close when the actual reading is reduced to material which i includes the given subjects  is attractively written and  is easily accessible this fact supplies the motive for the research herein reported and constitutes whatever practical justification there may be for the study as a whole procedure with so much by way of perspective we may attack the central question what is the relation of actual reading to subject interest in other words to what extent is the reading done by a typical group of adults concerned with subjects upon which the group expresses most desire to read to answer this ques
subect interests and aictual reading  tion it is necessary first to discover what subjects are interesting and uninteresting as such then to determine how much material is actually read upon each subject and finally to make the comparison the three steps will be discussed in turn to explain the method of procedure the section on findings presents the evidence a what subjects are most interesting the desire of a given group of readers to know more about the subjects discussed in what they read has been said to constitute one of the more important conditions of satisfaction in reading while this statement applies with greater force to nonfiction it is also applicable to fiction we have then to suggest methods by which to discover how much interest a given group of readers has in the subjects discussed in contemporary literature because such methods have been described in detail elsewherei a very brief statement will be sufficient here the procedure consists i in selecting a sufficient number of individuals to represent the group being studied this number is found to vary from  to i persons  the individuals so selected are asked to rate a list of subjects which has been prepared by classifying the subjects discussed in american periodicals published during the past ten years  from the ratings thus obtained it is possible to score the topics according to the interest of the group so that the relative interest in the subjects is indicated  the scores so obtained are then checked for reliability in order that the variation of relative group interest in the topics may be accurately known when the variation is small the scores are highly reliable because this procedure has been applied to nearly two hundred different groups with successful checks for reliability in each case it may be safely accepted for use in defining subject interests to be compared with the subjects upon which the members of a group actually read i douglas waples and ralph w tyler what people want to read about chicago i
 the library quarterly b on what subjects do people actually read previous methodsthe problem of finding out what people read has been attacked by many different methods and on the basis of many different assumptions the methods of attack naturally vary with the nature and size of the reading population studied the type of reading considered and the timeelements involved in general the purpose of most work in the field has been to determine what people want to read on the assumption that what people do read is what they want since the primary purpose of the present study is to examine the validity of this assumption it is necessary to mention a few of the traditional methods of recording actual reading with brief comments on each i the most obvious method consists in collecting sales figures and library circulation records sales figures are commonly used to show which newspapers and magazines are most widely read library circulation records are used to indicate which books are most popular for example the books scored each month in the bookman are based upon relative circulation as reported by over a hundred libraries those in the publishers weekly are based upon sales reported by one hundred selected bookshops when used to determine what people actually read the evidence obtained from sales figures and library records has severe limitations the most serious weakness is that readers are riot differentiated the data do not show what people buy or borrow the materials but merely the number of copies sold or volumes borrowed hence it is not known what proportion of the population or community is represented nor how the readers of one type of material differ from readers of other types the figures may apply to the reading of a very few people only and not represent the community as such  another type of evidence is obtained by having individuals list their favorite readings this method is defective for the reason that it serves merely to indicate titles that the reader  the single exception known to the writer is the work of walter hofmann of leipzig who distributes circulation data according to age economic status and sex

 the library quarterly since most of the difficulties noted are due to the extreme length of any list that approximates completeness the attempt has often been made to reduce the list by means of samples that is to say historical novels on the revolutionary war would be represented by one or two novels of this type that are as likely to be read as any that might be listed this procedure however has been found to sacrifice validity to convenience experience with this method as applied to university students has demonstrated clearly that samples chosen arbitrarily do not represent the class  a fourth method has certain advantages over the three already mentioned this consists in having individuals selected to represent any desired groups record all their reading for a sufficient period of time to offset seasonal variations since the task of writing down the list of newspaper items read each day might take longer than to read them various supplementary methods need to be used to cover newspaper reading of these the most satisfactory is that developed by gallup of iowa which is to ask each individual reader to go over yesterday paper and say what items were read and how carefully similar though less definite findings have been obtained by nafziger of wisconsin who prepared a check list of regular press features which was mailed to subscribers with the request that they mark the features read daily if some such provision is made for the peculiar difficulties of newspaper reading the diary method of finding out what selected groups actually read is highly useful as applied to magazines and books it has however two important limitations one is that the individuals who can be persuaded to record their reading are necessarily those most interested in the problem they are accordingly likely to take their reading seriously for this psychological reason if for no other they are likely to read more material or what they consider to be a better x c h gallupan objective method for determining reader interest in the content of a newspaper unpublished doctoral dissertation university of iowa  i ralph  nafziger a reader interest survey of madison wisconsin ournalism quarterly vii i i i

 the library quarterly of the major types of publication newspapers magazines and books furthermore it is only when all types of reading are taken into account that the record is complete and it is only when groups are studied instead of individuals that satisfactory reliabilities can be obtained finally the methods have never been applied in combination to any one group of readers so as to produce a complete picture of their actual reading even within a given time limit procedure used in the present studyit is now appropriate to outline for comparison with the methods just described the procedure we have used to record actual reading for which statistical reliabilities have been determined as a result of experiments conducted by miriam d tompkins with the five methods suggested in the foregoing paragraphs it became evident that the observer method while it is the most effective is also the most difficult to apply this method was accordingly abandoned nor was any use made of sales figures and circulation data for the reason that such data do not identify the readers each of the other three methods was used to some extent a books adults having less than six grades of schooling are found to have short lived memories of the books they have read hence each member of the industrial groups studied was given a blank on which he was asked to write down the books by author and title that he had read during the previous two weeks this simple procedure proved entirely satisfactory as a means of securing an accurate record of the books read by the groups during the particular weeks covered the significant fact in connection with the record of book reading by the industrial groups however is that there were only i non fiction titles read while i fiction titles were reported as read by about ii people most of their reading was confined to magazines and newspapers the check list method was used to determine the reading by university students in non fiction books upon current topics of i this procedure is presented in detail in the appendix appendixes are omitted from this article but will appear in a subsequent monograph bearing the same title

 the library quarterly possible to show how many of the preferred subjects are among the subjects most read about when the factor of accessibility is controlled as was shown for newspaper reading the difficulty lies in the fact that accessibility depends very little on relative space given to different subjects in particular magazines it depends very largely upon what magazines are available as compared with magazines not available and we do not know which magazines are not available all we know is that the magazines actually read by the given readers contain interesting articles on relatively few of the subjects preferred by those of either sex some evidence on this point may be found by comparing the magazine titles of the following list with the preferred subjects shown in tables vii and viii in making the comparison it is important to note that while several well edited and comprehensive magazines appear on the list they are read by very few persons the magazines read by as many as io of the  individuals reporting include non fiction articles on a very limited range of subjects the inference seems safe that more magazine reading on the preferred subjects would result if magazines containing articles on the other preferred subjects were more accessible however the data are not conclusive on this point hence the case for accessibility of material on preferred subjects as a factor of reading satisfaction must rest on the newspaper data previously shown list of magazines american boy  i colliers   american girl   i columbia  americanforest  i comfort and home i xmerican legion   cosmopolitan   american magazine  i delineator i ii american mercury   extension  i athletic journal   i field and stream  i atlantic monthly  i forum  i baseball   i geographic   better homes and gardens    good housekeeping   bookman   harper  i boys life   hygea   christian science sentinel    ladies home journal    the figures indicate the number of persons reading each magazine during the four weeks period

 the library quarterly ences in the readability of the books the list of i titles was reduced by omitting those that are written in a style that is technical or difficult for any other reason the number of titles thus omitted was  reducing the list to  titles attractively written and reducing the number of subjects from  to  when the interest scores on the  subjects were correlated with the reading scores based on the attractively written books the coefficient rose from    to   the important influence of readability upon the relation of subject interest and actual reading is thus apparent when the books are equally readable more reading is done on the subjects of most interest while the relationship between subject interest and actual reading in non fiction books is positive and significant when differences in readability are minimized a coefficient of  is still a long way from perfect correspondence that is to say the difference between this coefficient and the highest one our reliabilities would permit about o shows clearly the presence of other variable factors in the situation one such factor that can most safely be assumed on the basis of data presented is accessibility this we have seen to be highly influential in its effects upon reading in newspapers and magazines we do not know the relative accessibility to the given students of the books on the non fiction check list if we did we could determine the correspondence between subject interest and book reading when the readers selection is confined to books that are both readable and accessible data are being collected to this end which should certainly establish a closer correspondence between subject interest and actual reading than  the relationship which exists when the books actually read differ widely in their accessibility to the group as a whole the foregoing evidence on student reading in non fiction books thus supports the assumptions made at the outset to explain the consistency of data on book reading and the data on reading in newspapers and magazines as related to subject interest the relationship is scant because attractively written material on the preferred subjects is not readily accessible to the readers
