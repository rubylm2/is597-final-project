introduction michel foucault  stands as one of the primary wellsprings informing the project of constructing a viable critical theory of library and information science lis or librarianship he is widely cited and his insights are adapted in various works that focus on lis forms of power discourse archaeology silences exclusion defining the other domination and micropractices in the last fifteen years of criticaltheoretical lis scholarship see eg  for instance this journal in issuing a call for papers cfp on discursive approaches to information seeking in context for a future issue is sponsoring a line of analysis heavily influenced by foucault noting that in recent years lis researchers have begun to explore  how people give accounts of their information behavior or construct the meanings of technical artifacts in work and everyday life the cfp stated the importance of studying how information practices  are constructed in discourse  from a broader sociological perspective see final reminder call for papers for library quarterly special issue on discursive approaches to information seeking in context at httplibrarycareersblogspotcomfinalremindercallforpapersforhtml primary foucauldian ideas such as discourse socially constructed knowledge and artifacts are embedded in that cfp foucault described discursive practices as not purely and simply ways of producing discourse they are embodied in technical processes in institutions in patterns for general behavior in forms for transmission and diffusion and in pedagogical forms that at once impose and maintain them  p  see also  p  the concept is understood here as the intertwining of  nondocumentary practices  with language symbols drawings shop talk ideologies and the production of documents  p  similarly the reference to socially constructed knowledge and practices uses foucaults analysis of the human sciences beneath the increasing leniency of punishment is a whole new system of truth and a mass of rules hitherto unknown in the exercise of criminal justice a corpus of knowledge techniques scientific discourses is formed and becomes entangled with the practice of the power to punish  pp  finally in studying particulars and the constructed meanings of artifacts in everyday life foucaults concern with silences and what has been overlooked  allowing obscure police and prison manuals and medical texts or institutional architecture to speak for themselvesis echoed that is they are to be viewed without resort to the subject  revealing a level of intelligibility all their own  p  see also pp   pp  by looking at the mundane informationally speaking and analyzing how we construct our practices and invest our artifacts we construct knowledge from the bottom up unconcerned with understanding wholes or logical systems but rather features that help to reverse the traditional strategy of searching for continuities  p   the cfp represents a line of questioning and research deeply influenced by foucaults work and consequent influence in librarianship whether in the foreground or background plenty of other thinkers have focused on foucaults philosophical turf such as text power exclusion language representation communication and the incommensurate and fragmented nature of knowledge jacques derrida ludwig wittgenstein ferdinand de saussure jeanfrançois lyotard jean baudrillard gilles deleuze jacques lacan richard rorty and roland barthes are the core thinkers usually linked with him  yet it is foucault who is far more central to the project at hand for instance de saussures work on language as a representational system signifiers is cited in an article on cultural studies and librarianships image his ideas are filtered primarily through the work of stuart hall who makes the key linkage between foucaults work and stereotyping and power while de saussure and foucault are both equally cited it is foucaults notions of analyzing representation media stereotypes of librarians  that ultimately constricts the power and economic status of a gendered profession which drive the analysis in the article  p  much the same can be said of another work already cited here while lyotard and baudrillard are both included it is foucaults work on discourseagain cited but also filtered through mark poster nancy fraser and marike finlay  pp which informs the analysis the point is not to ferret out each instance of foucaults hidden influence in criticaltheoretical lis work but rather to note that it is foucaultnot those commonly linked with himwho has much greater influence for instance two recent studies place foucault at the core of this effort karen pettigrew and lynne mckechnies study identifies a body of work centered on theory in the humanities where foucault and closely related concepts and thinkers predominate  p  while ronald day  places foucault at the center of deconstructive theory in lis a core group in librarianship has seemingly taken up the challenge laid down by michael harris  and wayne wiegand  to more fully explore foucaults work and having responded to that challenge it is now time to look more carefully at the implications of his thinking which has undergone extensive review analysis and critique this article is a first step in this vein within lis this will not be a comprehensive review of every foucauldian notion or citation of his work that has filtered into the literature but rather a review of common themes used by that core group of lis authors involved in the aforementioned project their work  uses or explores foucaults ideas prominently  appears primarily in the most prestigious journal venues of theory in the study cited earlier and thus is widely cited and influential and  avoids methodological approaches via constructivist social or otherwise user studies and notions of seeking which run afoul of foucaults epistemological critiques of subjectobject content and agency and lead to positivism  the article will then turn to critiques of and problems in foucaults thinking since it is the contention here that by relying on foucaults insights for a line of analysis and research this theory of librarianship will reflect some of the problems in his work   a critical theory of lislibrarianship refers to efforts to explore various theoretical and philosophical positions and their meaning in the spirit of critically uncovering and exposing to scrutiny the hidden assumptions guiding work and researchmuch of which is broadly grounded in a critique of positivism  the terms librarianship and lis are used here interchangeably they are inclusive of the people and institutions of the three traditional areas of public academic and school libraries as well as those who research and theorize about them this is an inherent argument against common artificial divisions among practice theory and research finally a definitional note on the use of the terms theory and theoretical is also needed a helpful recent study on the use of theory in the lis literature reviews many working definitions of the term but casts theory as broadly as possible to capture its widest range of use by including articles in which a theory was simply mentioned several times  p  i adapt sheldon wolin  pp   it is not enough to cite commonplaces viz that facts are senseless without theoretical concepts or that the meaning which facts acquire from a theory is purchased at the price of shaping the facts by the theoretical perspective employed rather the important distinction for him is that the problem be a truly theoretical one that is not technical in nature or the most expeditious means of achieving goals  agreed on beforehand wolin argues that theory should be concerned with the systematically mistaken mistaken arrangements and wrong action such as injustice alienation and exploitation which are not random consequences of a system but rather consequences of an extensive set of problems which can be confidently expected to continue theoretical work in response seeks to displace the systematically mistaken often ending in radical critique foucauldian themes in lis this review and sampling of foucault in librarianship will not escape the problem michael walzer identified a constructivist reconstruction of foucault since he never presented his ideas in anything like a systematic fashion his ideas overlap and one must ignore certain selfdenials for instance despite foucaults participation in the radical deconstruction of the meaning of author he simply takes him to be an author in the conventional sense making arguments and claims to plausibility with acolytes who conventionally pursue research agendas along lines laid out by his authored writings  pp  poster also notes some of the same basic issues  p  second this review will not be an intramural disagreement regarding the correct interpretation of foucault but rather in the spirit of its subject will take this appropriation on its face as a discourse given these two caveats his ideas as appropriated and used in lis criticaltheoretical work will be grouped here in four thematic areas discourse powerknowledge fantasia and genealogyarchaeology before taking up these themes it is worth noting that one common overriding use of foucaults thinking in this literaturethat of the critique of positivism and instrumental reasonwill not be reviewed since it is a subject extensively covered already see the summary of summaries in  and need not be repeated here discourse the single most influential idea in lis theoretical work appropriated from foucault is discoursenoted earlier and restated here as practices that systematically form the objects of which they speak  p  it is discourse in this foucauldian sense that has been around in this literature the longest primarily as a form of critical selfreflection for instance bernd frohmann  pp  has long argued the salience of discourse analysis which takes discourse as its object of analysis  listalk is a set of serious speech acts which are performed by institutionally privileged speakers  from at least  to the present day the discourses of lis are thoroughly intertwined with specific institutional forms through which power over information its users and its uses is has been and will continue to be exercised from this basis he moved on to argue for a connection between discourse and documentary practices in librarianship building on another of foucaults insights on the documentation of surveillance and its part in the mechanisms of discipline foucault quoted in  p  frohmann has since critically focused on discourse and documentary practices and the resulting authority invested in science information science and liss role in privileging instrumental epistemologies definitions and forms of knowledge that obscure the operation of power     lis theory is so extraordinarily unreflective about its institutional underpinnings to warrant the hypothesis that powers invisibility is the consequence of a deliberate discursive strategy  p  gary radford with different coauthors at various times has explored similar ideas the key to understanding the production of scientific knowledge is not the phenomena comprising the world but the prevailing systems of  discourse in which certain propositions about the world can count as objective and others cannot  p  however it would be fair to characterize radford over the years as focused more on specific library practices and images of librarieslibrarians as the discourse to be unpacked for instance he often cites as a basis of analysis libraries organized collections of texts and the ensemble of rules by which the true and false are separated  p  see also   or the contrasts between the library as discourse under controlsurveillance and the power embedded therein and the sometimes contrasting media discourse of stereotyped images of librarians   he is the author most explicitly concerned with explaining foucault and his meaning for the field and arguing that discourse itself is a legitimate object of inquiry going on to write in the article he wrote about the article he had written that was being read at that moment what is important is not what a prior sentence means but that it has appeared in this article radford explains that all these together form a foucauldian statement and their importance is not their veracity but rather their existence in relationship to one another and the conditions in which texts appear  pp   used simultaneously as a toolmethod and as a way to define various textsstatementsspeech acts as objects of study foucauldian discourse analysis is often argued to be a means to achieve reflexive practice in the field see also    powerknowledge it cannot have escaped notice that tightly interwoven with discourse is the relationship to power and knowledgethemselves tightly interwoven in foucaults thought a society without power relations can only be an abstraction  p  the development of  branches of knowledge can in no way be dissociated from the exercise of power  the fact that societies can become the object of scientific observations that human behavior became  a problem to be analyzed and resolved  is all bound up  with mechanisms of power  the birth of the human sciences goes hand in hand with the installation of new mechanisms of power  indeed truth is no doubt a form of power  pp  power and knowledge directly imply one another  there is no power relation without the correlative constitution of a field of knowledge nor any knowledge that does not presuppose and constitute at the same time power relations  p  see also  over and over again in the work under review here lis theory and research and everyday practices in librarianship are cited as prime examples of foucauldian power and the masked workings of authority via knowledge in the fieldparticularly in view of the traditional claim of neutralityobjectivity for example the effects of  positivist approaches are clearly discernable in that the profession embraced the ideals of neutrality and objectivity and sought to formulate laws and generalizations applicable to libraryrelated activities it was via foucaults analysis of power and knowledge  that the constitution of a specific field of knowledge is now viewed as a political act which simultaneously configures a field of ignorance  p  frohmann quoted on p  see  pp  for a summary review and      for examples the previously mentioned organization of texts is an emblematic theme concerning powerknowledge often directly citing foucaults comments on the tight enclosures of libraries andor the legitimating system of books publishing and libraries  p  see also     pp  finally radford has explored the related power theme of librarianlibrary stereotyping and fear via a line of analysis grounded in foucault    unattractive and disempowered stereotypes are seen themselves as an exercise in power or symbolic violence ironicallycontradictorily played off against the dangers of uncontrolled discourse that libraries are culturally meant to be a bulwark against the ironies run both directions here since librarieslibrarians exercise power via the organizing principlesviolence of the institutions but are themselves disempowered powerand what constitutes professional knowledge and practicebecomes a key element to be uncovered usually through an analysis of discourse fantasia another specific idea pulled from foucault is the notion of the fantasia of the library based on his close reading of gustave flauberts the temptation of saint anthony  pp  revealing reason in the form of hallucination dreams in the form of scholarship and as such both aspects are significantly weakened  in frohmanns analysis it is science that is a fantasia produced by the librarys and lis theorys organization of its discursive regime foucault demonstrates that beneath the appearance of religious rapture or frenzy in flauberts work on saint anthony stands meticulous erudition that constitutes a commentary on the library the proliferation of texts and the relationships between them  pp  both gary radford and frohmann come to similar conclusions madness creeps into the order of the library and the library orders the madness of hallucination  new texts bring new orders new possibilities and new worlds fantasias as texts influence the reading of other associated texts and this becomes the provenance ofand contradiction withinlibraries which after all seek to institutionalize particular arrangements of texts  p  while frohmann and others   use this metaphor and analysis to uncover and decenter the epistemology and text of science and lis radford argues that this represents a fruitful epistemology to open up possibilities heretofore precluded in librarianships discourselike the worth of less credited texts and the insights of unindocrinated library users   genealogyarchaeology like powerknowledge the concepts of genealogy and archaeology are much intertwined in foucault i am working on a history of science that  seeks to discover the discursive the institutional and the social practices from which these sciences arose this would be an archaeological history  discovering the point at which these practices became coherent reflective techniques and a particular discourse emerged from those techniques and came to be seen as true the point at which they are linked with the obligation of searching for  and telling the truth  is to construct a genealogy of the subject the method is an archaeology of knowledge  p  jon simons notes that foucault conceptually moved from the task of archaeology to genealogical critique  to characterize his historical studies his archaeologies looked at the form of power that makes individuals subjects via the development of the human sciences  pp  while his genealogies are attempts to reconstruct the origins and developments of discourses by showing their rootedness in a field of forces  p  the contingency and fragility of historical forms  p  are his specific targets but they are embedded in his dispute with larger themes of western thought such as the supposition of the subject  an objectively stable and sovereign ego as both the source and basis for all knowledge and transhistorical forces like the capital of marx or the unconscious of freud  like foucault the lis literature that makes use of these terms also elides them so both are subsumed under this brief discussion john budd  pp  adapts foucaults genealogy as the term to describe his overall project of illustrating the various branches of lis thinking and philosophy from the main line thus demonstrating the variability of thought situated within the aforementioned critique of positivism while he notes disagreement with foucault on some issues such as the existence of truth he still finds the concept compelling and highly useful influence is not simple  all thought is part of the genealogy and while there may be competition or suppression there is also the possibility to assess merit on the grounds of reason and intellectual soundness and the present project does attempt to find at least some hint at origins of the current mode of thinking in lis in turn gary radford  pp  advocates an archaeology of lis with similar goals what foucault adds to this understanding of the fields past is the realization that invoking this history is not meant to simply tell us how lis came to be the way it is examining the past is an attempt to understand and disturb and transgress the boundaries definitions and shape of the present in this formulation coming full circle radford  previously invoked budds prior work  to argue for a shifting of thought discourse and research via interrogating purposes and assumptions via foucauldian analytical forms this review does not purport to represent the entirety of foucaults ideas in librarianships criticaltheoretical literature for instance the relationship among documentary practices the surveillancedisciplinary society and micropractices as relays of institutional power  pp  represents a form of foucauldian analysis concerning the unrelenting expansion of rationalized systems of administration and social control  interiorized to the point that each person is his or her own overseer  pp   the concepts are clearly related to those already reviewed but it is not yet a widespread theme in this literature nor was the goal to again put the positive case for his ideas and their efficacy and application to librarianship and its theoretical basesthat has already been thoroughly done rather this review established foucaults central influence and described it in broad themes present in the core criticaltheoretical literature since conceptual imports bring with them discursive strategiesand therefore embedded problems and forms of power as one of the authors already reviewed has noted  p the task now turns to reviewing the critiques of foucault of relevance to lis against foucault what are the problems that the conceptual importation of foucault into lis theory brings with it the place to begin is with jürgen habermass   critique of foucault habermas takes him seriously as a thinker and thus bothers to trace both the antecedents and the consequences of his work the spatial metaphor of inclusive and exclusive reason reveals that the supposedly radical critique of reason remains tied to the presuppositions of the philosophy of the subject from which it wanted to free itself  inside and outside are linked with domination and subjugation and thus the other of reason remains the mirror image of reason in power  p  the potential for excitement stylized into the other of reason becomes at once esoteric and pseudonymous it comes up  as a turning point in the archaeology of the human sciences for foucault  whether in the form of meditative thought or of genealogy heidegger and foucault want to initiate a special discourse that claims to operate outside the horizon of reason without being utterly irrational  pp  foucault did not think through the aporias of his own approach in that his theory tries to rise above the human pseudosciences to a more rigorous objectivity and  gets caught all the more hopelessly in the trap of a presentist historiography which is compelled to a relativist selfdenial and can give no account of the normative foundations of its own rhetoric the resulting presentism relativism and cryptonormativism are the consequences of his attempt to preserve the transcendental moment proper to generative performances in the basic concept of power while driving from it every trace of subjectivity  pp  the radical critique of reason extracts a high price for taking leave of modernity  p  habermas repeatedly traces and establishes the links between foucault and other thinkers placing him in a continuum from the romanticismnihilism of nietzsche on through the scurrilous game of derridas deconstruction and the counter discourse of modernity  pp    pp  the result is a theory which grasps the whole as untrue and offers the impossibility of escape as the only affirmation possible  matching the mood of the critique of civilizationa profoundly neoconservative position in his view  p   see also  pp  it is his negationsantienlightenment antimodernity antimarx antifreud antitruth antilogocentrism and so onwhich define foucault foucauldian individual action such as it is is aptly named by john tate  as an ethic of transgression if there is no separate selfonly that which is constituted by the discourses that dominate itthen human freedom is foreclosed there will only arise another discourse to define control and dominate the individual who has no particular reason to transgress  foucault never reconciled his assertion that his work was to give new impetus  to the undefined work of freedom  p  with statements that he did not think that it is possible to say that one thing is of the order of liberation and another is of the order of oppression  and i do not think that there is anything that is functionallyby its very natureabsolutely liberating  p  or his rejection of the idea that under power with its acts of violence and its artifice we should be able to rediscover the things themselves in their primitive vivacity  p  this issuemuch simplified herestands only first among the objections of foucaults critics they note a host of contradictions and gaps such as the lack of a clear epistemology or methodological protocols with which to ground and thus evaluate his work and so on  pp      however beyond the significant implications of his nihilism foucaults contribution to a critical theory of librarianship contains specific issues that also bear examination issues of text and conceptions of power text put simply foucault conflated many texts and thus forms of discipline power and their objects krishan kumar places him within the continuum that proclaims that the concept of textuality applies to the world not just the book  p  see also   p  similarly poster traces the rooting out of logocentrism and anthropomorphism in foucaults designation of documents as monuments to be studied as largescale social phenomena via his radical decentering or simple ignoring of the subject authordesigner etc and their intentions it is through these definitions and textual methods that these monuments speak for themselves and reveal their own internal logic  pp  textsthat is discursive formations discourses neglected tracts institutional designs manuals of direction and procedure and social formations and organizations all intertwined in and with power and knowledgebecome something to be read and traced archaeologically and genealogically in the foucauldian sense walzer notes that foucault is highly selective in the texts he chooses to read steering clear of actual people and their experiences and preferring to remain in the realm of rules plans designs and regulations the result is two problems first subjection to  control is not the same thing as being in prison foucault tends to systematically underestimate the difference second physical and intellectual disciplines are radically entangled enabling the complete equation of knowledge with the imposition of power  pp  foucault thus conflates the demise of the transcendental subject of history with the lack of knowledgeable human subjectsthe second having cardinal significance in anthony giddenss view  pp  he goes on to echo walzer in criticizing foucaults equation of the prison with the factory and his denigration of bourgeois freedoms that have turned out to be very real  in the light of  totalitarian societies  pp  and formal rights however incomplete that allowed labor to organize and exert political influence foucault turns this on its head since totalitarianism existsexisted it must be implicated in the systems and discourse that make us free freedom is therefore a masked discoursetext of dominationdisciplinecontrol of which we are unaware and cannot transcend on the matter of the textual death of the subject feminists and minorities have been quite pointed why is it exactly at the moment when so many of us who have been silenced begin to demand the right to name ourselves to act as subjects rather than objects of history that just then the concept of subjecthood becomes problematic  and why is it only now that critiques are made of the will to power inherent in our effort to create theory hartsock quoted in  p  this is a point echoed repeatedly this theoretical construct and its language is as hegemonic as the world it attacks  surfacing interestingly enough just when the literature of peoples of color black women latin americans and africans began to move to the center  p  speaking truth to powersometimes the only means of effective resistance for the less powerful frequently done via the creation of their own alternate textsbecomes merely an effect of power itself in foucaults terms  p  see also p  this clearly echoes habermass contention that foucaults thinking inadvertently ends in a form of neoconservatism closely related is the notion that there are two foucaults the first is continental firmly grounded in intellectual arguments with freud and the discursive construction of mental illness marx and the transhistorical subject of the proletariat and questions of the historical sovereign the second was the american foucault appropriated by literary theorists to read and still further deconstruct texts and discourses in disciplinesincluding the language of literary analysis in this however seemingly subversive the traditional apparatus of textuality is affirmed and the sanctity of the kinds of things done under the rubric of literary criticism litcrit is reinforced  p  see also  pp   it is the american litcrit foucaultand the consequent freezing of academic and literary hierarchieswhich is so poignantly protested above power if the preceding discussion overlapped this category it is worth reminding ourselves again that foucaults concepts are tightly entangled in his thinking imbricate is a favorite word to describe this effect it is nonetheless worth examining commentary oncritiques of his concept of power as a separate genre poster observes that he does not reduce discourse to a material or social referent but constitutes it within the play of power  discourse does not act at the behest of power it is power he goes on to note two serious problems first in this formulation of discoursepower foucault makes at base a positivist argument that he does not adequately address his new categories fit the data better than the old ones second foucault poses conflicting claims concerning discoursepower analysis to the specific rise of the social sciences as a general theory of history or both the first is limitedobviating his general claims concerning the nature of power the second is a challenge to marxism displacing the centrality of the class and the means of production in a new formulation of power as a central vehicle of social control and  a means to comprehend and undo it however thus constructed it is radically ahistorical for instance equating the confessional of four hundred years ago with the contemporary psychotherapy session the result evacuates differentiations between historical epochs by the form not just the content of their discursive practices  pp  to posters two problems must be added a third the problem that arose in the attempt to dethrone marxism if power so reconceptualized has no subject the proletariat the bourgeoisie or the sovereign and is in fact a network of relations in which we are all always and everywhere enmeshed  p  then there is no point to or means of opposing or toppling the state or the economic system there is no commodity of power to be seized it has no origin or source foucault attempts a way out by claiming that power produces resistance  pp  but the larger question is thus raised again how why and toward what ends we move perplexed but unresisting from a the analysis of certain historic regimes of truth as repressive to b the suspicion that all hitherto existing regimes have been in some regard repressive to c the nietzschean gloss  that discourse is a violence we do to things and thus all regimes are equally or incommensurably imposed  p  giddens notes that this generates a quiescence  p  and walzer contends that since he cannot point to an alternative  social criticism must always be a futile enterprise  p  leo marx notes that such formulations are even more technocratic than the distorted enlightenment ideology they seek to displace  p  for instance electronic communications only make texts and discourses ever more ubiquitous and power and discipline even more effective and ephemeralnow tied more closely to the economic control of the mind and not just the body  pp  it is worth noting again that habermas  see also the summary in  continually explored foucaults debt to nietzsche pointing out the consequent nihilism of his work finally richard brosio  pp     argues that power so conceptualized and analyzed is a lite form of oppression inviting a lite form of resistancetransgression in rich societies that are insulated from more blunt forms of exploitation elsewhere out of sight there are brutal economic realitiesthey just exist in places such as central america there are brutal political and governmental realitiesthey just exist in places such as sudan or colombia there is a grand narrative in placethe neoliberal conception of the market and jamesonian culture further democracy is not a question on the table in this formulation the foucauldian analysis of power simply provides no basis of challenge and in fact rules out these realities by bracketing them as realities and a function of discourse cesar chavez was apparently wrong inexpensive lettuce for americans was a discourse not the result of economic centralization and exploitation of a transient vulnerable peasantry in collusion with corporate and governmental exercise of coercion and power without a theoretical subject or the ability to locate a locus of power transgression is literally meaningless and hopeless and social and economic relations are frozenin stasis foucauldian problems in lis if as noted conceptual imports bring their problems with them the larger philosophical question is asked does the use of foucaults insights and methodologies bring librarianships theoretical work to similar nihilistic dead ends the implications are clearly on the minds of some of these lis authors one does not choose these roles of librarian or user the roles choose the subject and from foucaults point of view the librarian or even the library scholar cannot step outside of this discourse the point  is that these arrangements are made possible by an overarching and constitutive discourse of fear which makes the library possible  the discourse always comes first and one cannot get behind or beyond it since the act of transgression indeed its very idea is made possible by the actual discourse to be transgressed as a universal and totalizing organizing principle that gives the library its place in modern cultural forms and in institutional action this would seem to suggest a certain powerlessness  p  this is an essential question that the lis literature that seeks to place foucault critically and epistemologically at the center of the field cannot continue to elide however in the spirit of engagement this is not played as a trump card making pointless and ruling out further discussion rather foucauldian problems within lis themes are treated as a discourse from the critical vantage points just outlined and from four areas that will be outlined avoiding the economic the selfreferential nature of lis discourse analysis image and the unread text of libraries avoiding the economic foucaults animosity toward marxist categories and concepts may have been an intellectual tonic to an ossified marxist discourse but there is the troubling tendency of this form of analysis in librarianships theoretical literature to largely avoid the influence of economic factors one finds in this literature only brief references for instance to the economic status of the profession embedded within a media analysis  or to the economic power of young people as a market in relation to rock music  frohmann has gradually moved from an earlier point of dealing in the spirit of foucault with this theme  to a more purely foucauldian posture his recent book on scientific information and its theories and systems has no index entries for capitalism information and capitalism or the economics of informationor anything similar an unsubtle reading of foucault by an lis author reviewed here is characterized in the book endnotes as likely quite welcome to corporate sloganeers in that the meticulous erudition and untiring attention that foucault attributes to the hard work of exploring intervals between the tenets of order manifested in traditional library classifications are trivialized by reduction to the click of a mouse  p that is the most explicit that he gets in the volume the closest this literature comes is an analysis of the discourse of commodification  but the overwhelming emphasis remains on the analysis of culture  involving the interpretation of cognitive semantic or narrative content which lies hidden within the text  p  this very much tracks foucaults thinking given his fundamental suspicion toward grand theories in favor of local insurrections and relative conceptions of truth  p  and his correlative devaluation of questions concerning who possesses power and by what right who suffers and who profits  p in short marxist and economic analyses however this is a rather large and obvious gap in an age when immense efforts are pointed toward social and economic transformation necessary for the new economy based on information and postindustrial expertiseknowledge and in an age when media ownership and control is expanding rapidly enough to raise serious concerns about control monitoring and the ability for alternate viewpoints to even surface in mass media and libraries   the selfreferential nature of lis discourse analysis an lis discourse that focuses on lis discourse already suffers from the foucauldian tautology of power noted at the beginning of this section it insists that it is a proper and needed object of study but the means to transcend or improve library discursive practices are largely foreclosed in foucaults terms sometimes this literature simply avoids this questionor points to contradictory statements within foucaults work that might allow some foothold for hope see eg     however the greater danger is extreme selfreferentiality and irrelevance the point of lis discourse analysis becomes lis discourse analysis in foucaults terms this article is a statement because it appears in the context of a particular discursive formation in other words it appears in this issue of the library quarterly and he is not interested in  whether this article is accurate or not but in a perspective for the description of the condition in which texts appear  p  part of the intent of the texts mentioned here  is  to control an argument through the language employed and the conclusions reached by the reader  the discourses both reflect and contribute to the ways we think about lis and its place in contemporary culture  and how it surfaces in the professional discourse  p  her authority to interpret her own work  would seem to be somewhat at odds with  foucault in that meaningsignificance is not determined by authors but constructed by readers  but one product of these constructive processes  was a construction of the prominent lis author as the most authoritative interpreter of her own work  the shift in liss theoretical attention from information system to information user is especially suited to questions of the role of lis theories in the discursive construction of specific identities  p  again the question is posed what is the point one could say that this article is itself a statement in this discourse but i have argued elsewhere that the adoption of a postmetaphysical epistemology habermass in this case need not preclude and in fact explains actual historical change and even improvement in librarianship meaning socially and linguistically built up over time along with the means by which people rationally construct understanding and as socialnormative background provides a basishowever currently corruptedfor reflexive selfunderstanding and democratic political will formation  in contrast foucault in lis seems to have left us with strategies without projects  p  two further points need to be made concerning selfreferentiality and authority first frohmanns earlier description of lis discourse from  to the present as an exercise in power over information and users can certainly be critiqued in its own foucauldian terms it appropriates a discourse and describes its boundaries in order to form a discipline in the dual foucauldian sense  as an exercise in discipline power via a methodology and  as a categorization subsuming the discourse and thus forming the discipline of lissimultaneously configuring a field of ignorance as he put it  p  what vantage point of authority does a foucauldian lis analysis assume that puts it outside of such a critiqueand again toward what ends second this discourse although prominent is to quote frohmann  pp  again performed by institutionally privileged speakers lis professors and those with the requisite prestige from other fields who have taken an interest in librarianship this in itself is not necessarily remarkable but the problem of selfreferentiality is real one respondent to a study of lis researchers noted that were a small field and we all know one another we all talk to each other we all go to the same conferences and perhaps this is why there is not much negative citation we dont want to give too much criticism to each other quoted in  there are other examples but the point suffices however it is the reaction to those outside this circle an important foucauldian concept unreflexively used in this literature that is revealing for instance an author at some remove who characterized lis writing as this incredible stream of garbage was described as uncharitable while two others affiliated with us library schools and journals in the field who came to similar conclusions are described much more gingerly  p  an article by a librarian and education professor two classic examples of foucauldian low epistemological profile that specifically critiqued positivist conceptions of librarianship from a nonfoucauldian vantage was identified with the a priori positivism of library neutrality  p  most pointedly when a library director challenged some of this literature in this journal the reaction was swift and thorough   foucauldian unconcern with accuracy and truth went out the window in that case and again this literature seems to assume a vantageless point of authority and critique at times image separated from habermass  p  excitement stylized into the other of reason the stateoftheart foucauldian language and focus on various texts seems to settle around an ageold bane of the profession poor image while the choice to analyze stereotypes in movies party girl  pagemaster sophies choice and uhf  and in commercials  serves to unpack those images they still focus on an issue that the field has been rightly criticized for being obsessed with and trivializing of our work and research for many years polly thistlethwaites essay old maids and fairies captured why the image problem bothers usparticularly menso much because the stereotypes read queer with a capital q  p  echoing brosio unpacking these popular media images is a lite form of transgression and while amusing does nothing to challenge the widespread gender discrepancies in images of power competence and authority as they relate to technology by librarians and information workersat least one area where these analyses might have some positive effect  similarly one can see the image issue vibrating lightly under the surface of the work that urges the field to come up to speed in terms of more avant garde ideas and methods the field has come relatively late to an awareness of qualitative research  research in lis has generally been characterized by a loose confederacy of approaches  but a serious cultivation of the potential of qualitative research has yet to emerge  discourse analysis belongs here too  p  elsewhere this same author invokes lamentations of sterility which at the same time seem to coexist happily with  the extraordinary license enjoyed by lis theory  p  epistemological naïveté too seems to hurt our image the unread text of libraries like foucaults preference for prison designs and manuals for the classification and treatment of prisoners or the insane foucauldian lis picks and chooses its texts about libraries highly selectively flauberts the temptation of saint anthony along with foucaults fantasia of the library     stephen kings the library policeman isaac asimovs forward the foundation  and umberto ecos the name of the rose  are prominent examples in these texts and their lis readings libraries are laden with power control fear and radical contradictions utterly absent is what wiegand has long identified as the understudied everyday ubiquity of libraries there are more public libraries than mcdonalds restaurants three times more reference questions posed in academic libraries than people attending college football games more visits to libraries than to national parks in the united states etc  and real peoples continual testimony on the importance and centrality of libraries and reading in their lives american libraries gathers quotes in a regular column thus said and features prominent people who continually repeat these themes my real luck was having parents who shared the love of reading and who introduced me to the wonder of the library id shut every tavern and church before id allow my library to close i applaud the determination of university libraries because if students  cannot see and feel and touch the books that human beings have made written written in and read then they will lose touch with the very essence of what it means to be human more than a building that houses books and data the library represents a window to the larger world mark fallon richard russo jean ballard terepka and barack obama respectively quoted in  pp   the foucauldian answer is of course that these represent their own underanalyzed discourse of power but that is simply too pat too easy this is the american litcrit foucault that essentially turns wiegand on his head that libraries are such a commonplace good makes their power discourse all the more sinister and hidden perhaps even demonstrating that libraries and reading are more culturally and economically domineering than mcdonaldsor television libraries in this lis selection and reading of this literature are equated with fortresses cathedrals tombs crypts labyrinths monasteries otherworldly and intimidating edifices violence control constraint humiliation and the borders between coherence and incoherence      this echoes the weakness noted previously in the critiques of walzer and giddens and the focus represents a choice and an exercise in power to ignore the meaning of mundane text in favor of the exotic problematic and contradictory if as poster notes foucault cannot justify his choices of topics or texts  it is hard to see these lis authors effectively justifying theirs these various readings fail in the main to challenge economies and relations of power via gender or now surveillance in the age of the usa patriot act and they represent only a partial skewed reading of libraries again a foucauldian tautological ruling out of order is too easy too selfreferential tom mann inherently challenges this kind of thinking in his attack on economic and instrumental lis discourse and management practices that derive from it our profession has apparently forgotten that research libraries will continue to be necessary for  crucial purposes  not accomplished by remote storage or massive digitization of books and not served by transformation of library buildings  specifically those purposes are  to collect in print form  current imprints that are not freely accessible to everyone online because of copyright restrictions  to make such sources freely and easily available  within the public spaces defined as libraries and widely distributed among thousands of communities  to catalograther than merely inventorythe books to create categorizations linkages and webs of conceptual relationships  while also eliminating irrelevant associations  to facilitate both depthsearching of subject content and systematic recognition discovery  by means of classified shelving that enables scholars to do focused browsing of contiguous subjectrelated full texts  to make  available  the one  format  that promotes  the actual reading of lengthy narrative and expository texts necessary for conveying knowledge and understanding  and to preserve knowledge records for centuries not mere decades our leadership floating at the  foot level apparently does not grasp the crucial requirements of scholarship at ground level  we are blind both to the strengths of real libraries and to the weaknesses of the internet and  are transforming research libraries into their very opposites  p  see also  manns analysis demonstrates that looking at discourseor a discoursedoes not by definition lead to stasis critique challenge and positive change are possible his challenge was anticipated by wiegand who noted that library classification schemes are flawed but they constitute one of the few bridges available to all who use them to help link the separate islands of discourse  capitalism doesnt necessarily appreciate all of this democracy does quoted in  p  finally there is an ahistorical aspect to the foucauldian lis reading of libraries that echoes the critique outlined by poster earlier historicalinstitutional changes dare one say democratization or progress and broad social developments such as public education in which librarianship was embedded or in which librarianship actively participated are entirely absent in this literature the text of librarianship as read in these terms does not admit of historical developments or future possibilities there is in short a vast unread part of librarianship that points toward potential beneficial change and past the enabling of readers and patrons conclusion many of the thinkers used here to critique foucault eg poster do so in order to capture and further his most important and effective insights even habermas foucaults most severe critic acknowledged his influence foucault has most lastingly influenced the zeitgeist not least of all because of the seriousness with which he perseveres under productive contradictions only a complex thinking produces instructive contradictions  p a point echoed by walzer who calls him importantly wrong and acknowledges that foucault has forced us to recognize that there is no such place as a realm of pure value and that there is no value untouched by power  pp   in contrast to these acknowledgments of importantbut limitedinfluence foucauldian lis theory lays claim to a sweeping territory a grand analysis and one that will take library scholars far beyond their traditional domains  to situate the library  within prevailing systems of power and knowledge that constitute and maintain all of the discourses and institutions within contemporary western civilization  a big step but  one that library scholarship needs to take in earnest  p  the lis writers here are engaged in a project of constructing a viable critical theory of librarianship however a theoretical import that enjoins against possibility and positive change leads to stasis foucaults statements such as to imagine another system is to extend our participation in the present system  this need for theory is still part of the system we reject  pp  define stasis and it translates to lis theory after thoroughly reviewing and critiquing the problematic much of which was derived from a foucauldian perspective of a variety of discursive and deconstructive theories and theoretical appropriations in librarianship day  pp  can only weakly conclude that despite such theoretical weaknesses and  sheer theoretical disasters the practice of information science has produced successes theoretical discourse and practical activity are not and may not be in any given practice causally linked as with medieval medicine mystical theoretical foundations and practical successes may coexist within what is claimed to be a field of inquiry his analysis only leads to more discourse analysis more deconstruction of essential termconcepts and more fragmentation there is for day always a larger frame of discourse and domination surrounding us requiring it and there is simultaneously no subject of or ground to define and defend freedomthe binary of necessity it may be transgressive to focus on discursive patterns and contradictions in lis or to deconstruct media images and reveal their embedded discursive power but habermass dismissal of the capering and cynical intellectual byproducts of a focus on the refuse dumps of civilization  camouflaged with plastic is well taken  pp   a variation on an earlier comment is that foucaults work seems to be a strategy without a subject  p  as walzer put it one cant be critical unless one inhabits some social setting and adopts however tentatively its codes and categories or unless  one constructs  a new setting and works out new codes and categories foucault refuses to do either  p  it is the argument here that foucaults place at the center of this literature represents ultimately not transgression with a purpose but stasis the aim is not conservative but the result is a foucauldian reading is only a partial reading of the library text it is a conceptual import with its own discursive agenda that rules out all or most of the end purposes of such a critique like many of foucaults critics i am not content to leave it there the goal has been to highlight a longstanding problematic within his work that has been analyzed and written about extensively and bring it to bear on that part of librarianships criticaltheoretical project that uses his thinking as i have written elsewhere critical educational scholarship offers an instructive and germane example of a field that has struggled with the pushpull of these ideas and how to productively incorporate them  toward that end henry giroux notes that rather than negating the modernist concern with public life and critical rationality we must provide  the grounds on which to deepen and extend such concerns  engagements with foundationalism culture difference and subjectivity provide the basis for questioning the modernist ideal of what constitutes a decent humane and good life  talk about the public must be simultaneously about the discourse of an engaged plurality and critical citizenship  and conditions that organize public life as a democratic social form rather than as a regime of terror and opposition  what is being argued for is a language in which different voices and traditions exist and flourish to the degree that they listen to the voices of others engage in an ongoing attempt to eliminate forms of subjective and objective suffering and maintain those conditions in which the act of communicating and living extends rather than restricts the creation of democratic public forms  pp  if foucault can thus be enlisted to help as dick hebdige put it quoted in  p  open inquiry consider formerly inadmissible evidence and erode domination by experts then he can help librarianship enhance  our collective and democratic sense of possibility if however our theory of librarianship radically fragments the field radically bifurcates theory and practice and sternly enjoins against a purpose then possibility is precluded and we are in the words of the educational philosopher maxine greene foreclosed from thinking of things as if they could be otherwise  p
