  journal of education for library and information science can students interests in pursuing research that focuses on experiences within the african american community students should be encouraged to research areas that are of interest to them and that will contribute to the existing body of scholarly work in lis students should also be assured that if they decide to undertake research that focuses on issues unique to or largely about their ethnic group their contribution will be considered to be as serious and as worthwhile as others work about non ethnic issues recommendations for recruitment and research it is hoped that this study will be a catalyst for additional inquiry into the topic of african american doctoral students in lis doctoral programs in order for lis to foster its commitment to increasing diversity there must be obvious efforts toward understanding encouraging and embracing voices from each underrepresented population recommendation  an in depth qualitative study should be conducted to gain detailed and diverse perspectives from african american females and males who have earned a phd in lis about what influenced their choice of institution their experiences while matriculating in their respective programs what influenced their research topic and track their careers subsequent to obtaining the phd recommendation  results of the qualitative study should be used to develop recruitment efforts that encourage african americans to enroll in lis phd programs recommendation  administrators of lis schools who have succeeded in recruiting retaining and graduating african americans in multiple years should be queried to document the methods used to achieve success recommendation  a survey should be conducted to examine the level of support african american students in lis are shown when they choose to pursue research with an african american or multicultural focus recommendation  results of the survey can be used to design instructional materials for lis schools that will assist faculty who advise african american doctoral students in determining the best practices for supporting and encouraging this group of scholars doing so will likely increase the rate of retention and graduation among african american lis phd students recommendation  a comparative study should be conducted that examines the similarities and contrasts of dissertation purpose statements of all african american
a decade of doctorates   men and women who have earned the phd in lis to note trends in research topics recommendation  scholarly pursuits should be conducted with the specific intent of identifying unique characteristics of each ethnic minority group as they relate to enhanced understanding of each group needs in order to increase recruitment to retention in and graduation from lis doctoral programs beyond these recommendations the findings of this study indicate a number of other potential research avenues and topics that could be explored to better understand how not only african american women but other underrepresented populations as well choose dissertation topics related to diverse populations and reasons that they choose to become or not become lis educators these include  what are the factors that make an lis master program successful in producing graduates from underrepresented populations and encouraging those graduates to pursue doctoral degrees in lis  what are the academic social professional and economic support systems in place for students from unrepresented populations who attend lis phd programs  how can funding programs that support lis education  like the laura bush st century librarianship program of the institute for museum and library services imls  play a stronger role in increasing the presence of students from underrepresented populations in the master level and eventually the phd level in lis exploring research questions such as the ones above allows the focus of studies of diversity in phd programs to begin to become expansive enough to include all unrepresented populations in lis ultimately lis would greatly benefit from a large scale survey and follow up interviews of the lis phd graduates from underrepresented populations over the past ten years this type of large scale study would reveal a great deal about research social professional and economic factors that lead students to choose dissertation research topics how such research carries over into their career decisions about whether or not to become lis educators and if and how they try to bring studies of diversity into their professional careers this type of study could greatly inform the lis profession about how to change educational programs to promote diversity in master programs phd programs library professions and lis faculties conclusion the importance of increasing diversity and us education there are many important reasons to focus on increasing the diversity of lis faculties and increasing the amount of research and teaching being
  journal of education for library and information science conducted about the information needs of underrepresented populations first the diversity across the faculties of lis schools does not reflect today multicultural populations a situation that may not bode well for the composition of future lis faculty for example while the percentages of whites and of asian americans and pacific islanders in the general librarian population and among lis faculty is equivalent to or higher than among the general population african americans and latinos are the two largest minority populations in the united states and the two populations most sorely underrepresented among lis faculty and librarians and native americans comprise less than   of librarians and lis faculty further the representation of persons with disabilities among lis doctoral programs and faculties remains unexplored increasing diversity in lis faculties is necessary to broaden of the number of perspectives in teaching research service leadership and administration better reflecting the diverse users of libraries in the united states second research indicates the representation of diverse peoples throughout the education cycle is critical to achieving the pluralistic goal of education therefore a lack of faculty members from underrepresented populations will serve to perpetuate a lack of diversity in lis as a whole third faculty members from underrepresented populations in predominantly white faculties are vital as recruiters mentors and mediators for students from underrepresented populations fourth colleges and corporations that are the most diverse are often highly regarded and highly successful as such limited diversity among lis faculty may be fairly sizeable detriment to lis programs as a whole lis programs must accept responsibility for populating the profession with a new generation of culturally competent librarians however culturally competent librarians can only be educated by diverse faculty offering diverse perspectives on information a key part of that is developing a better understanding of why more members of underrepresented populations do not choose to get doctoral degrees in lis one reason may be related to the social networks that impact why individuals chose a particular occupation many people  family members friends teachers counselors and other role models among others  have an impact on the decision of an individual to join a field perhaps the current level of limited faculty diversity becomes self perpetuating when there are an insufficient number of mentors available from under represented populations the overall limited amount of teaching and research related to the experiences of underrepresented populations may be another factor in the continuing limitations on diversity in lis however faculty members from underrepresented populations will not necessarily be interested in or capable of teaching and researching in areas related to underrepresented populations in the case of african american doctoral students the majority are choosing not to study issues related to diversity a further issue is that many graduates of lis doctoral programs become library administrators rather than academics as such not only are the percentages of african
