employee turnover among full time public librarians richard rubin analysis of employee turnover is common in business and industry understanding the cause and magnitude of turnover can help assess basic aspects of the organization such as the adequacy of pay hiring practices and evaluation procedures fairness of supervision effectiveness of communication and quality of leadership unfortunately turnover analysis in librarianship is rare the purpose of this study is to examine employee turnover in thirty one public libraries in the midwest particular emphasis is placed on establishing base line turnover rates and examining the relationship of gender to turnover behavior among the findings are that  turnover rates are low compared to other occupations and  turnover rates of males and females are similar but females are more likely to leave their jobs for family and personal reasons to those librarians who think we have exhausted subjects for consideration and are frankly bored by ala meetings i would respectfully suggest that a study of labor turnover in libraries would be desirable some of it could undoubtedly be prevented   p  charles compton   introduction and review of the literature employee turnover is generally defined as the crossing of the membership boundary of an organization  pp   it is most commonly characterized by voluntary resignation termination and retirement turnover is a subject of considerable study in the management and social science literature mowday reports that more than one thousand studies have been conducted on turnover since   p  the reason for the ubiquity of such studies is manifest studying  school of library science kent state university kent ohio library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved    s  
 the library quarterly turnover provides important information on the health of organizations high turnover may suggest for example poor employee selection practices inadequate training and supervision discrimination or poor salaries or working conditions employee turnover is also expensive to the organization cascio identifies three major sources of costs  the cost of separation for example exit interviews administrative activities separation pay  replacement costs for example advertising and interviewing and  training costs for new employees for example informational literature formal training and training for the particular task  pp   cawsey and wedley add the cost of lost productivity both as the employee prepares to leave the organization and in other staff who may be adversely affected by the employee departure  p  the costs of employee turnover in librarianship may be considerable roos and shelton estimated the cost of hiring one academic librarian in  to be between  and   p  although this evidence is anecdotal there are sufficient additional albeit indirect data to suggest that the cost may be substantial both king research and drennan and darling have provided data on the number of librarians who leave their jobs drennan and darling in their  study of the library labor force report that of the  public librarians covered by their survey  persons left the profession within a two year period  p  this is an annual separation rate of  percent and does not include those who left their positions but remained in the work force king research in its  national study of library manpower although not reporting turnover rates did note that  librarians left their library positions in  to seek other employment or leave the work force  p  this represented approximately  percent of the  librarians in the work force  p  turnover rates an important aspect of turnover analysis involves an analysis of turnover rates unfortunately annual turnover rates even for business and industry have not been systematically collected since the government stopped collecting them in   p  generally when rates are reported they are given by broad occupational categories rather than specific industry based on studies from the bureau of labor statistics the civil service commission and other sources price tables  and  has summarized the available data on turnover rates for five types of organizations and by occupational group  p  of particular note for librarians price analysis of the turnover data revealed that the turnover rates of service workers are considerably lower than those of goods producing workers  p  the small amount of data on library turnover rates supports this observation

 the library quarterly table  group means for reasons for leaving married turnovers excluding retirees and other reason mean relocation with spouse  family reasons  further education  take another position  by rubin reporting a turnover rate of  percent among full time public librarians and by neal reporting a turnover rate among academic librarians of  percent   the low turnover rate is especially notable because of the numerical dominance of females in the profession given their low pay and the fact that they occupy a disproportionate number of lower level positions one would suspect greater turnover despite these facts however the female turnover rate is not only low but it is also not statistically different from the male rate what plausible factors could contribute to this apparent stability in the professional librarian work force as a whole and for females in particular late career choice one possible explanation for the low turnover rate is that the choice of a library career comes relatively late simpson and simpson note that librarianship has an especially high proportion of late deciders  p  many of whom had other careers before librarianship it may be that increased maturity and work experience create stability among librarians research on the general labor force indicates that a large proportion of american workers spend their mature working years with the same employer  p  the presence of family responsibilitiesalthough competition with family responsibilities is recognized as a complicating factor for females in the workplace  p  this factor may be a source of stability as well as instability braunagel in her study of academic librarians found that  percent of the female librarians who expressed no intention of leaving their geographic area gave the presence of their spouse or family as the reason for their wish to remain  p  federico et al in their analysis of the general labor market argued that women with family responsibilities actually had lower turnover rates  p  the need for income either to support oneself or familydickson in her study of librarians returning to the library work force found that 
employee turnover  percent n   identified economic reasons for their return  p  the idea that the female income is discretionary even in the twoincome family is obsolete barrett reports that  million females  percent of the female work force work out of economic necessity  p  the need to remain on the job for most females is not a matter of discretion and provides strong motivation for remaining on the job despite lower pay and position lack or perceived lack of opportunity for job movement the lack of opportunity for movement has been identified by price as an important variable in turnover behavior  pp   braunagel noted that although male and female mobility were the same females perceived that they were less mobile than their male counterparts  p  heim and estabrook reported that twice more women than men felt that they had limited mobility  p  this perceived lack of opportunity for employment may diminish female turnover rates high levels of satisfaction with the type of workthe present study does not examine job satisfaction as a variable although it is recognized as an intervening variable in turnover decisions high levels of job satisfaction are negatively associated with turnover behavior  pp   it is reasonable to speculate that the low turnover rates among librarians reflect higher levels of satisfaction in librarianship than in other occupations what factors in library work could produce satisfaction among the library work force dlia reported in a study of  librarians that two variables were key aspects of satisfaction for librarians supervisionhuman relations and ability utilization  p  these variables include the competence and interpersonal skills of the supervisor the way in which policies are carried out and the opportunity to have responsibility to be creative and autonomous and to achieve and be recognized  p  it is possible that libraries meet these needs to a greater degree than do other professions or that the library work force is more easily satisfied than workers in other occupations only job satisfaction studies across occupations could provide an answer similarly it may also be that librarianship provides the predominahtly female work force with an environment that simultaneously offers both professional fulfillment and sex role congruence this explanation fits a sex role model described by nieva and gutek in which women select female professions because they can perform sex appropriate roles in them  p  in librarianship the female librarian can fulfill the traditional female roles of service helping and teaching and at the same time strive for the basic professional needs of achievement and recognition it must be emphasized however that at present there is no research that supports this explanation
 the library quarterly differences in reasons for leaving although males and females were found to leave their jobs at the same rates the data reveal that females were much more likely than males to leave the work force often for family reasons males were more likely to remain in the work force to take other positions but the discriminant analysis did not support this pattern for unmarried females only for married females approximately  percent of the females in the present study left for family related reasons this pattern is consistent with other library data and with data from the general labor market heim and estabrook found that  percent of the female librarians surveyed had left their last positions for child care purposes  p  braunagel found that  percent of the female academic librarians left for family related reasons  p  agassi in a study of  females in the general labor market found that  percent left their last job for family reasons  p  however it must also be emphasized that over half the nonretiring females who resigned left to take other jobs braunagel reported that in  percent of the cases in which a female academic librarian left her job she moved to take another position  p  added to this must be the recognition that the gender differences in reasons for leaving may be exaggerated males may find it less acceptable to admit to an employer that they left for familyrather than careerrelated reasons although there is no direct evidence from research in librarianship concern over sex discrimination includes a fear that library administrators may be less confident in the hiring of women because of their suspicion that family obligations could reduce the job commitment of females and increase their turnover this fear is reflected in the general labor market where current equal employment opportunity guidelines for sex discrimination explicitly identify the belief that females have higher turnover as a discriminatory belief  the present data does not support such a belief although females are more likely to leave their jobs for family reasons these reasons substitute for rather than add to reasons for quitting the rate of leaving for males and females is not significantly different some final observations the low turnover rates for public librarians highlight the importance of making good hiring decisions each turnover becomes a comparatively rare opportunity to introduce productive employees into the system similarly it emphasizes the need to train motivate and encourage the many librarians likely to remain on staff the large number of turnovers who are voluntary retirees suggests that library organizations must provide for a work force that matures within its organizational boundaries
employee turnover  it is unknown how many of these voluntary retirees might have been productively retained so that the institution could continue to benefit from their knowledge and experience understanding the causes of turnover in librarianship requires more study of particular interest should be an investigation into the relationship of work performance and turnover behavior given the relatively low turnover rate it is critical that libraries know whether their strong performers are more likely to leave and if so to determine the organizational causes similarly it is important to know if poor performers are likely to stay and to identify what aspect of the organization might be encouraging unproductive employees to remain references  compton charles h comparison of qualifications training demand and remuneration of the library profession with social work cited in the library and its workers by jessie sargent mcniece pp   new york h w wilson   price james l the study of turnover ames iowa state university press   mowday richard t porter lyman w and steers richard m employee organization linkages the psychology of commitment absenteeism and turnover new york academic press   cascio wayne f costing human resources the financial impact of behavior in organizations new york van nostrand   cawsey thomas f and wedley william c labor turnover costs measurement and control personnel journal february     roos tedine j and shelton diana w the cost of hiring an academic librarian journal of library administration  summer     drennan henry t and darling richard l library manpower occupational characteristics of public and school librarians washington dc department of health education and welfare   king research inc library human resources a study of supply and demand washington dc government printing office   haber sheldon lamas enriquej and green gordon a new method for estimating job separations by sex and race monthly labor review  june     rubin richard e a pilot study on employee turnover rates in three moderately large public libraries in ohio journal of library administration fi winter     neal james presentation given at the allerton institute november   university of illinois at urbana champaign urbana illinois  barnes william f and jones ethel b differences in male and female quitting journal of human resources  fall     viscusi w kip sex differences in worker quitting review of economiss and statistics  august     american library association academic and public librarians data by race ethnicity and sex chicago ala   heim kathleen and estabrook leigh s career profiles and sex discnrmination in the library profession chicago ala   braunagel judith job mobility as related to career progression of female academic librarians in the south phd dissertation florida state university
