the library quarterly volume x january  number i an inquiry into the statement of motives by readers helen l butler although psychologists educators and librarians have for several decades interested themselves in the problkx lems attached to the various functions of reading concern about the question of why people read at all has been comparatively recent and yet the answer to that question might solve a good many difficulties encountered by the librarian in supplying readers with the books best suited to them for upon the drive or motive back of the reading activity depend the energy purposefulness and perseverance which the individual is willing to devote to that activity it is obvious that the reader in search of diversion will not be driven by the same force as will the person whose job health or closest ambition demand the understanding of a complicated technical process or the mastering of a foreign language when advancement in professional status depends on the passing of promotional examinations for example reading of a more intensive nature occurs than when the urge is founded on some temporary desire for escape from surroundings or thoughts for some readers to have a practical return from reading imi essential portion of unpublished doctor thesis university of chicago graduate library school  i
 the library quarterly mediately available and not postponed into an uncertain future is to cause the material to be perused with greater attention than would otherwise accompany the process with others the opportunity to project themselves into an imaginary world almost entirely motivates their reading and from such reading they take an immediate and a sustained satisfaction w w hatfield has said the chief element that differentiates one reading activity from another is the purpose of the reader at the moment in library practice any additional information which helps to clarify the librarian knowledge of readers needs is desirable considerable light might be expected from the identification of reading incentives light which would result in a more intelligent understanding of and sympathy for those needs the unsatisfactory circumstance of readers being unable to describe the material they want or its treatment and scope because they are unfamiliar with the implications of the subject are diffident and uncomfortable in the library or are inarticulate in phrasing their needs may be alleviated by the librarian ability to judge what is needed when the occasion for the need is made known and there is avoided the equally unsatisfactory situation which sometimes results when the librarian simply brings all the material on the subject indicated which the library possesses deposits it before the reader and leaves him to choose what he thinks he needs only the simplest commodities are so dispensed by commercial firms with all others the salesman is considered by virtue of his associations and experience to have expert advice to offer about the product he sells and so to be in a position to advise the buyer to a far greater extent the professionally trained librarian is better acquainted with his book collection and its possible help for the reader than is the reader in any case when the book collection is too large to be conveniently placed on the table before the reader a choice of materials becomes  an experience curriculum in english a report of the curriculum commission of the national council of teachers of english new york d appleton century i p i
the statement of motives by readers  imperative in this choice a knowledge of reading motive will allow the librarian to infer something of the effort the reader is willing to put into his reading and will so provide a clue as to the treatment desired if the motive can be shown to be a condition affecting many people in the community its presence will certainly concern a noticeable proportion of these learning of its presence and potential power to turn people to books the librarian may prepare against the call emanating from it by purchasing sufficient material or may use it as a stimulus for reading among those who would not ordinarily think of books as a source of satisfaction in that connection the studies made of reading incentives including this one have returned inconclusive results a fundamental difficulty encountered by the few inquirers into the subject and an obstacle none have been able successfully to surmount has been the determination of an appropriate and meaningful terminology and its classification into real and discrete groups broad sweeping generalizations are so inclusive as to be meaningless when applied to the reader who appears at the library desk on the other hand the narrower the limitation the more individual the application the more personal the occasion inspiring it the less likely is the term to apply to a group of readers however small although all may be reading identical books and the less useful to the library for that reason add to this the wishful thinking of many readers which makes them ascribe to their reading purposes which are overambitious for the material read plus their inability in as many instances to identify the exact impulse which sent them to books and we easily understand the difficulties which beset the investigator too many readers are like a certain rochester youth in knowing only that they just have a natural tendency to read collecting data in an attempt to ascertain reasons for such confusion and to identify more exactly if possible the primary reading motives the writer compiled a list of some one hundred purposes which might be satisfied by books drawn from her own library ex

the statement of motives by readers  made available in the rochester public library and readers were invited to fill them out about io forms were returned most of them with full information on the items asked for although about one sixth were useless for any part of the investigation of the returned forms  showed the educational group to which these readers belonged  per cent had grade school education about  per cent had high school  per cent had college and about  per cent had graduate work only  of these forms were generally useful fewer omissions were noted in the marking of the last item called for the age group than in any other except sex it was clear that the scorer did not tire before completing the form but that he omitted earlier items because of disinclination to supply the information one fourth of the  readers who filled in this item were in the fifteen to nineteen years of age group  per cent were in the twenty to twenty nine years of age group a little less than  per cent were in the thirty to forty fouryears of age group and a little less than i per cent were over forty four years old these figures agree with conditions observed in other library systems where the number of borrowers over forty years of age is much smaller than that of the teen age or twenties the sex of the rochester readers as far as the sample may be typical differs from the usual library distribution of the ios people who gave their sex  slightly more than  per cent were men and i slightly less than  per cent were women most students of reading report that feminine readers predominate significantly the fiction forms returned in that division of the rochester public library showed  per cent women and  per cent men forms showing occupation numbered i of these the largest class by far consisted of students and the second largest of housewives other occupations were not classified after the first half of the questionnaire had been analyzed and it became apparent that there was no relationship between occupation and reading motives
 the library quarterly an important assumption must be understood in regard to these figures whenever data are collected by such gratuitous methods as were employed in this study it must be taken for granted that the persons who filled out the forms represent in their true proportions the users of the entire library or of the separate collections they are using it is recognized that the adolescent reader more accustomed to tests and questionnaires than some of his elders is not only willing but eager to respond to a request of this kind whereas older readers may be reluctant to take the time necessary to give the information asked for without recourse to actual book card and registration records for proof it must be assumed that the forms returned by the patrons represent fairly the separate groups of department users but since students represent less than  per cent of the given occupations while the fifteen to nineteen year and the twenty to twenty nine year groups represent  per cent of the readers it is not likely that the presence of the students in this study skews the picture disproportionately what then are the motives which the reader says actuate him when he picks up a book to read motives governing in various subject fields fictionfrom the tabulated scores of the items checked by readers in various subject fields certain similarities and differences are evident in fiction obviously the recreational motive runs high first in rank it was the purpose of  per cent of the fiction readers but general information can also be pleasantly acquired through the medium of fiction  per cent believed the escape motive ran third  per cent checking it fourth in line was curiosity about people in other countries next the psychological impulse to analyze human motives and conduct in paper and ink creatures information that comes from contact with a keener mind than ones own may also be obtained through fiction  per cent ofthe readers thought almost an equal number  per cent frankly admitted the herd motivereading the books one friends talk about it was seventh in rank eighth i per cent was the desire to learn history pain

 the library quarterly from the notes supplied by individual readers we get a glimpse of the dreams and aspirations of travel readers ranging in a wide arc from the sublime to the ridiculous there was the college bred irish clerk in his thirties who chose webb miller ifound no peace to understand and read how other people meet the crisis of life regardless of place or occasion and a night school student in his twenties who declared stamp collectors read travel books because it helps them to locate and understand a place most interesting was the reason advanced because it revealed the reader so clearly by an assembler a member of the american legion of grade school training and past his forties obviously a rolling stone because i travelled myself some and has a friend whom seen quite a bit of the world and i want to read more about these places his choice was j n hall tale of a shipwreck the teen age collegian keeping in mind the not far distant job wanted to read erna ferguson guatemala because some day i hope to do field work in the south american countries which are new to botanists and geologists equally vocational but not so realistic was the note added by the first year high school student who borrowed grinnell by cheyenne campfires he wrote gravelyone can picture with what sober self dedicationto prepare for my chosen vocation sociological materialsociological material is interesting to our purpose for four reasons this subject field is one of three in which recreational motives did not appear within the first ten ranks in only one instance did the ten high ranking motives here dip down from the general statement to the specificto know more about the business of government in this subject also as in the philosophy religion field the teaching motive was higher than in the other fieldsit had third place finally sociology was the only subject in which the motive of reading for the sake of proving an argument was found within the first ten ranks this must not be taken too seriously though because it is traceable to the fact that a number of debates were being held in rochester in february and march and to the fact that debate books on whatever topic were commonly classified as sociology
the statement of motivies by readers  aside from these purposes in these days of social unrest and political uncertainty men turn to sociological works for general information to get the point of view of wiser men to keep up with new ideas to obtain job efficiency to pass civil service examinations to satisfy their curiosity and to prepare for another job of little or no significance in this subject to the group concerned were the examples of friends reading study clubs directions for making something learning to write remedial education personality development escape from reality contests parliamentary procedure understanding human relations matters of etiquette and the ability to handle statistical data directly related to this of course is the fact that few books circulated on these topics philosophy religionmen read philosophy religion for general information too but the proportion who read for this purpose  per cent is only a little larger than those who read to know what wiser men think  per cent which is as we expected to find it nor were we surprised that the teaching motive should be third in rank  per cent owing to the strong representation of teachers ministers and sunday school members among the readers the desire for general information seemed prompted partly by a wish to keep up with new ideas  per cent and partly by a desire to know what other people believe  per cent here is heartening evidence of a wish to understand one neighbor and his point of view and creed which carried far enough should help to provide a basis of mutual sympathy and respect the ever present interest in biblical matters which grips a good part of our population undoubtedly put that item next in line i per cent of the group scoring it the number of readers i per cent concerned about their own conduct in the solution of daily problems was only slightly smaller than those intelligently we trust curious about their neighbors beliefs widely varied are the books from which the former expected the answers to come and from which we gain an insight into the questions that perplexed them an article in the cyclopedia of religion and ethics on prayer and the soul an article in forum on birth control scott religion and com

 the library quarterly differences in motives due to education and literary discrimina tionno evidence was found in the rochester data for the belief that purposes change from one stage of scholastic advancement to another as has been advanceds there is more reason to believe that certain purposes fluctuate with the reading experience and maturity of the individual with the discrimination and critical ability he possesses these of course may show more plainly in readers of increased educational opportunity but sometimes readers with little formal education possess them as well table i i shows the rank order of the various motives as assigned by men and women readers of fiction when the titles of the books chosen were arranged according to three rather subjective levels of excellence men readers of the superior type of fiction were sent to books with the initial hope of taking advantage of the author riper wisdom practically the only instance of that item ranking first readers of the two lower masculine groups and all women readers put recreation first all six groups used books as a means of escape but the male readers of the least sophisticated type put the item in second place next in importance to recreation unsophisticated readers of both sexes enjoyed the story element in fiction the thrill and suspense of the plot unfolding to a greater degree than did the readers of the more sophisticated groups women readers of all three groups attached greater importance to following friends examples in reading and the readers who chose the finest type of literature put this motive highest making it share first place with recreation the data obtained from the three avenues of approach just described rest upon practically the same techniques as have other investigations ie frequency counts of readers scores but before too much dependence is placed upon such judgments it must be accepted that i the motives checked are discreet s mabel snedaker and ernest horn reading in the various fields of the curriculum in national society for the study of education thirty sixth yearbook part i bloomington ill public school publishing i p

 the library quarterly the ready suspicion may arise that the motives listed were not sufficiently distinguishable to result in true reporting by the readers or that they were not even true motives but rather rationalizations on the part of the investigator counterpoise to this doubt is the fact that i librarians in daily contact with readers the country over had recorded most of the items as purposes which sent their patrons to the library for books  from pulpit press and school have issued for a long period exhortations to people to read which have stressed not one but many benefits to be derived  the individual own experience includes many instances where reading undertaken for a single purpose resulted in several subsidiary satisfactions the overlapping observed in the scoring is more probably only that which is inherent in the reading act itself and therefore inescapable so in any form of recreational reading pursued with the main intention of enjoyment there will inevitably be an accompaniment of information and almost as inevitably of several other by products as well depending upon the particular type of book which has value in the reader eyes d c griffiths clarifies this process somewhat in his comment on what goes on in the reader mind as he reads kim when he absorbs information about a fact in which he is not primarily interested though i am interested in india and willing to learn more about the life of its people i read kim not for this reason but because it is a good story my curiosity is only part of a general desire to know more of experience beyond the limits of my own environment while and after reading kim i imagine more clearly than before the hubbub of an eastern bazaar it appears  as if i were present at that strange place as if i as well as kim could see and hear what was going on i am therefore gratified mostly because i enjoy the story and feel sympathy with kim independence but also because i feel that my range of experience has been widened we conclude with this author that a reader probably turns to a novel with the main purpose of recreation in mind but that the reading often involves many rich by products which he  the psychology of literary appreciation a study in psychology and education educational research series no  melbourne melbourne university press  pp

the statement of motives by readers  in the list of items submitted to the rochester readers a few of the more common occasions were included to illustrate this double phase of motivation when in the opinon of the validating librarians they were encountered often enough at the library desk to be taken into serious account beyond this it was not feasible to go because to carry the identification of an individual occasion to its narrowest extreme is to limit it almost entirely to the person of whom it is true however the readers were invited to append to the list any motive not included which was true of the individual own case of the first  general items printed on all the  subject forms  were unmistakably occasions for reading school assignments passing examinations study club reading passing information along to others and puzzle contest reading all are personal rather than political or cosmic in circumstance two other motives proving an opinion and escape are open to interpretation as either occasion of or satisfaction from reading depending upon the intent of the individual reader in the special motives limited to one subject only there were  occasions in the  groups i each in fiction essay biography sociology philosophy religion education travel science  in drama  in fine arts  in poetry s in business and none in history in each of these items of occasion we should rightfully expect that the number of readers checking it would be considerably smaller than the number checking items which represent universal satisfactions and this was true of the two major satisfactions recreation and general information and of other satisfactions as well as in the total scores throughout the subject fields only the school assignment proved important in most of these but other occasions ranked high in one or two subject fields though they sank out of sight in the rest some of the occasions were responsible also for the single scores that were checked by from  to  per cent of the readers in the various fields especially by those checking the school assignment the examination the giving of information to others the contest and the debate items little if any interest was betrayed in the information itself but where the occasion was peculiar to one

 the library quarterly phasized the younger and more naive the reader the greater his general desire to know because the more restricted his life experience as life observation or reading brings the answers the circle of his emotional informational needs gradually closes and the number of new experiences possible vicariously becomes smaller and smaller and so he arrives at a stage when novel play or life holds few if any new emotional observations before that can happen however a depth of emotional understanding will have been plumbed which would be quite impossible in real life experience a less powerful response but one nevertheless easily discernible is man use of reading for purposes of relaxation and escape in the latter we have a temporary mental expedient employed during time of stress probably because reading is a habitual act with that individual which fades into other motives when the period is over in the former we find rather escape from muscular exertion or retreat from human kind or from impacts of other personalities which drain nervous energy from the individual here the tired mind and wearied body recover strength poise and sanity after an hour or two of reading this is directly in line with a basic urge toward change a change which discharges tension to which many psychologists call attention hobbies corresponding to man urge to play represent another form of this tendency although there is likely to be involved here an active co operation of intellect and muscles which is not characteristic of relaxation as such hobby reading also touches upon the mastery tendency more than any other perhaps this trait illustrates the multiple tendencies which a single reading act may imply in addition to the two primal urges for information and recreation it is usually accepted that there is an aesthetic and an in tellectual satisfaction to be obtained in reading aesthetic pleas ure is thought to be concerned with the enjoyment of beautiful sound of combinations of words of the images evoked by both it calls for an appreciation of the balanced phrase the use of sonorous or lilting words the magnificent sweep of an idea through its development to its climax not for the logic displayed but for sheer beauty of thought and structure it de

 the library quarterly great deal of exact information about the reader must be known too this involves however a degree of self analysis and the establishment of numerous psychological factors which are difficult for the ordinary reader to supply about himself conclusion and summary the review of the rochester data and of the psychological theories regarding motives for reading supports the initial assumption of this study that whenever a reader comes to the library for something to read it is well to ask why he wants it a score of people asking for the same sort of material will want it for as many purposes and will need as many different treatments of the subject to suit them one man may want a book for a half dozen different reasons or the same reader may use the same magazine or book in different ways at different times as far as the individual is a typical member of his group certain generalizations may be confidently made about his reading motives for example examination of the most heavily scored items in the various subject fields shows a definite correspondence between subject matter and the primary purpose in the groups reading about the subject it is evident that fiction is read by most rochester people for recreation fine arts for hobby riding and business and science for occupational reasons but a wide fringe of readers read for other purposes as well and the individual reader may just as often be a member of this minority or a member of the major group may just as often be influenced by a combination of other items also these subsidiary satisfactions must be uncovered and reduced to their true importance as minor purposes now covered by the major subject motives before we shall know all we wish to know about reading motives for both the group and the individual the rochester data provide sufficient evidence to justify the belief that the dominating motives which embrace all subject fields in all types of reading are i information getting both for the solution of immediate limited problems and for the uncderstanding of social and personal conditions sometimes already present and sometimes not specifically foreseen at the time of reading  recrea

the statement of motiives by readers  or as a profound and logical development of a psychological theory would repel a discriminating reader whose knowledge is more comprehensive this does not mean that the naive reader gains nothing in the process but simply that he gains less which may be all he is ready for in all events for as howard mumford jones has remarked in another connection the poorest of our trashy novels also serves to point out the fact that there are primal qualities of good and evil in the world and even though the development of this thesis be far from the immature reader thought when he takes up the book this subsidiary return comes to him also but because all readers do not enjoy equally well having the primal qualities of good and evil depicted for them and because some expect the nuances of human character to show too it follows that the librarian must know in which group the reader stands ie what constitutes information or recreation or aesthetic quality for him and what by products of each are expected in general the richer the book is in what the individual likes to add to his general store of information the better he likes it and the more significant and true to his own aesthetic experience the better the critical reader likes it if we accept the search for vicarious experience as the fundamental urge we can more fully understand why motives overlap in the reading process since in a single real life act or situation many satisfactions may be involved nevertheless that same single real life experience is usually dominated by a major impulse no matter what others accompany it from this theory of vicarious participation also we get fuller understanding of why reading motives do not lend themselves readily to verbal labeling and ranking too many elusive subjective factors are involved like the old man of the sea the same character changes shape too often what is recreation for one reader is hard work for another depending solely upon the urge for mastery what the reader labels escape may be either occasion or satisfaction and we cannot depend on him to distinguish which for us when a man is earnestly engaged in isthe place of books and reading in modern society bulletin of the american library association xxvii x
