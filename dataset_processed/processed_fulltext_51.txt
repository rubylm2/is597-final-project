professional values and ethics as defined by the lis discipline wallace koehler the library and information science literature suggests a growing theoretical congruence in professional values and ethics these values and ethics may be interpreted and applied in a variety of ways and through a variety of institutions the library and information science lis community has perhaps not been as responsive as it might be to these issues lis educators should first seek to identify the scope of the issues and then help students engage in what may become one of the more controversial domains of our time introduction ethics and values are important topics for the information professions we as library educators must be concerned with providing our students with a sound footing in our professional ethics we are faced first with identifying what our professional ethics and our core values are then by how to instill these principles and values into our students if indeed ethics and values are important topics for the information professions why is it possible to count on one hand the number of programs in north america or the world that offer a concentration in information ethics indeed the number of schools that offer even a single comprehensive course that focuses on information or professional ethics or core values is not much greater ethics and values defined we must first seek to identify what these principles and values are ethics are generally perceived to derive from and serve as the application of moral principles morals represent a set of mores customs and traditions that may have been derived from social practice or from religious guidance information ethics are perceived to be a subset of applied ethics or ethical principles that are both broad and theoretical but also have specific application ethics necessarily at least in their applied form undergo metamorphosis as underlying conditions change thus for example as technology changes the conditions of practice these change the ethics that guide the practice our professional organizations are one set of sources for both values and ethical principles many professional organizations have published codes of ethics the american library association ala for example took an early lead in defining a set with its code of ethics first enunciated in  many other organizations have since the author wishes to acknowledge and thank the three anonymous reviewers for their very useful comments on an earlier draft of this paper an earlier version of this paper was presented at the alise  annual conference journal of education for library and information science vol  no spring  issn    association for library and information science education 
  journal of education for library and information science about the author wallace koehler is associate professor and director mlis program valdosta state university wkoehlervaldostaedu ms received  accepted  revised  developed codes of ethics these vary in content and purpose dependent in large part on the responsibilities of the organization and the purposes the organization addresses values are a subset of morals rokeach offers the following definitions a value is an enduring belief that a specific mode of conduct or end state of existence is personally or socially preferable to an opposite or converse mode of conduct or endstate of existence a value system is an enduring organization of beliefs concerning preferable modes of conduct or end states of existence along a continuum of relative importance the application of values is ethics gorman defines the application of values as in application values are useful and usable because they are standards by which we assess what we do measure how near we are to or how far we are from an objective and compare our actions and our state of being to those of others and to ideals represented by our values codes of ethics and value statements are very recent phenomena for the information professions in the united states and with the single exception of the ala codes of ethics information professional associations did not begin developing codes until  in fact more than  percent of american information association codes of ethics were created after  the international federation of library associations and institutions ifla has defined a set of core values in its proposed revisions to its statute in addition the library profession in the united states has witnessed a recent debate within the ala over the identification and adoption of a core values statement cvs as both a guide for training practitioners and as a standard for its members at its july  meeting the ala council declined to accept the proposed cvs draft in the months preceding the july  ala meeting an interesting debate emerged from a number of ala constituencies favoring or criticizing the cvs draft the tenor of the debate suggested that the cvs as written failed to capture or adequately define the scope and intensity of ethical concerns within the profession ala is reported to have begun reconsidering another cvs draft by  the purpose of this paper is not to document and explain the ala cvs debate to discover some ethical malaise to prescribe courses in information or professional ethics or even to define what the ethical values of the professional should be instead drawing upon research done with others the author proposes to outline the
professional values and ethics as defined by the lis discipline    ethical precepts librarian and information professionals acknowledge through scholarly commentary their professional associations and personal beliefs once identified these different principles and precepts can be pointed to not as what should be but what practitioners actually prescribe to as the core values and ethical practices of the profession and to the commentary on values and ethics these then can be incorporated into courses and at minimum used as points of departure of discussion information as practice not only do we have to wrestle with the ethics and values of the information professions we must also acknowledge issues of definition in the information and library sciences for each definition of information and information and library science do we need different sets of ethics and values or does a single set cover all capurro has raised for us some very challenging questions at the nexus of the information professions and ethics for example he argues the question hat is information asks for substantial characteristics of something but information taken as a dimension of human existence is nothing substantial instead of asking hat is information we can ask hat is information science for    the aim of information science is to thematize this con textual dimension taking into consideration primarily all technical forms of communication as parts of other forms of life taking into consideration the unity of boths sic aspects the methodological and the pragmatic information heuristics and information hermeneutics information science can be considered a sub discipline of rhetoric as capurro points out for us the intersection of aristotlean rhetoric politics and ethics underpin the information professions capurro argues further that the question hat is information for leads to the question hat is information science for since information science conceived as a hermeneutic rhetorical discipline studies the con textual pragmatical dimensions within which knowledge is shared positively as information and negatively as misinformation particularly through technical forms of communication these are not just an instrument but a way of being this conception of information science is important if we want information systems to become part of the background of various forms of living our value systems and ethical practices become a part of that  the background of various forms of living we must also understand the well known dictum that where you stand depends on where you sit values and ethics may be colored by one perceptions of information and the professions core values and ethical practice core values and ethical principles are often perceived as one and the same but as we have seen are in fact somewhat different in definition and application they
  journal of education for library and information science may be deduced from at least three sources these are the literature that addresses professional ethics the codes of ethics of professional associations and the values reported by practitioners the literature many writers have identified some or all of the following values as core professional values see eg intner and schement stichler and hauptman hauptman rubin asheim baker devlin and miller johnson ford hisle and symons and stoffle intellectual freedom protecting library users right to privacyconfidentiality intellectual property rights professional neutrality preservation of the cultural record equity of access there have been several noteworthy papers that seek to enumerate core values and ethical precepts in the information professions in  rubin and froehlich offered nine values and ethical principles  privacy  selection and censorship  reference  intellectual property rights  administration  access  technology  loyalties and  social issues again froehlich in a very interesting paper in  enumerates six professional values and five ethical principles the six professional values he lists are  freedom and self determination  protection from injury  equality of opportunity  respect for patron privacy  minimal well being and  recognition for one work the five ethical principles are  respect for the autonomy of the self and others  seek justice or fairness  be faithful to organizational professional and public trust  seek social harmony and  act in such a way that the amount of harm is minimized koehler and pemberton suggest the following  patron or client needs  skill and competence and the roles of the information practitioner  support the profession  responsiveness to social responsibilities and  the rights of users fellow professionals the profession and society they found that while there are many different and very specific provisions published by each of the organizations they can essentially be reduced to six general categories gorman offers eight  stewardship  service  intellectual freedom  rationalism  literacy and learning  equity of access to recorded knowledge and information  privacy and  democracy koehler et al drawing on branch work surveyed librarians worldwide and asked them to rank eleven values  service  equality of access  information literacy  intellectual freedom  preservation of the intellectual record  literacy  professional neutrality  diversity of opinion  confidentiality  cultural diversity and  copyright issues

  journal of education for library and information science regulatory values can be both prescriptive and prescriptive these rules define in explicit detail acceptable or unacceptable behavior norms they tend to be lengthy and legalistic they may take one of two forms the first lists specific required or prohibited activities the other the small  liberal codes define the parameters of acceptable behavior behaviors between the defining norms are considered acceptable the greater the distance between the norms the more liberal is the system aspirational norms are defined by abstract goals these are the ends that professionals seek to emulate they provide moral guidance educational norms provide both guidelines for behavior as well as instruction and explanation to the reasons for the value or norm in a way regulatory values prescribe or proscribe behavior aspirational values provide targets to quest toward and educational values describe the reasons for prescriptions and proscriptions but also the map toward desired ends one reason codes of ethics take different form is that professional organizations do not all serve the same purposes different purpose  different code of ethics library associations perform a number of different roles in different societies and for different groups these roles can be divided into five basic types the first type is the association of associations andor of libraries perhaps the best known of these is ifla drawing its membership from national library associations and from member libraries ifla has a limited category for individual members but their ability to participate in the functions of the organizations is restricted there are also a number of national level library associations that limit membership to institutions and organizations these include the russian library association and the association of college and research libraries acrl in the united states others are comprised of individuals but limit membership to ex officio participation these include organizations for library directors directors of state libraries and so on the second type is the regulatory association many library associations particularly those in central and south america have a legal mandate to regulate the profession these associations sometimes called colegios or colleges establish minimum professional qualifications license professionals sanction those professionals for transgressions of the regulations and of the code and provide general associational functions these services include publication of newsletters and journals the convening of meetings and conferences and so on library associations that serve as trade unions to represent their membership to library management are the third type these associations negotiate labor contracts help establish work rules and sometimes administer the retirement programs for their members these organizations are typically found in the nordic countries of europe the fourth type is general membership organizations these organizations represent librarians and other information professionals within a given country region state province and so on they provide a wide range of services for their membership including the convening of conferences the publication of newsletters and journals and represent their membership at regional and international organizations many but by no means all publish standards of practice and codes of ethics for their membership
professional values and ethics as defined by the us discipline   the fifth is a combination on or a variation on some or all of the first four these are organizations for individual segments of the library professions these can be separated into three basic categories there are those that represent a library specialty medical librarianship academic librarianship records management catalogers and so on those that represent librarians with certain interests chinese collections toy libraries children librarians and those that represent librarians with specific characteristics racial cultural gender sexual orientation a first rule might be that the kind of ethics code an organization promulgates if indeed it promulgates one depends in large part on the kind of organization it is and the constituency it represents we believe these codes can present the basis for the development of a model syncretic and synthetic code koehler and pemberton examine the codes of ethics of thirtyseven professional associations in africa the americas asia europe and oceania these associations are both general eg ala and specific eg canadian information processing society they find  specific provisions that can be reduced to six major or basic elements these are  clientpatron rights and privileges  selection issues  professional practice  access issues  responsibilities toward the employer and  social issues they also find that some ethics codes are largely deontological while others are more abstract librarian values several surveys of librarians values have been performed in recent years these can be grouped by discipline and region there have been several studies of library schools students and directors in north america australia and the united kingdom these studies usually find similarities in the values held by library science students and faculty similarly hovekamp studied the work values of unionized and non unionized librarians in association of research libraries and found no significant differences in the work values of librarians in unionized versus non unionized libraries on the other hand allen investigated the work values of library science students as compared to those of business students and found differences in their attitudes toward work others have explored the values of working practitioners in various settings and countries these include kupiec work on collection development in france branch survey of united states us academic librarians savard study of north american librarianship dole and hurych focus on us and commonwealth of independent states cis academic librarians flinner or johnson in reference strauch and strauch in acquisitions bellardo in teaching bazirijan for deselection anderson in management as well as the general considerations expounded by froehlich hauptman and kostrewski and oppenheim it is also possible to identify professional values by surveying practitioners in recent years dole et al and koehler et al have taken a wider approach they surveyed almost  and nearly  librarians and other information workers throughout the world using a simple one page survey instrument respondents were asked to rank order the three most important of the values listed dole et al conclude
  journal of education for library and information science we demonstrate that there is differentiation of values among the librarian and information professions we believe this differentiation to be a function of the roles and responsibilities of the various professions we are not suggesting that function dictates ethical values for library professionals rather function specifies emphasis and order following the second survey koehler et al conclude without doubt and almost without exception librarians of all kinds in all positions in all regions and of both genders identify service to the client or patron as the most important of their values differences in the order of the importance of values are found at the second and third levels where differences occur among library professions these are probably a function of the different information roles and responsibilities of these information professionals where differences occur among library professionals in different countries and regions these differences are probably a function of the responsibilities and concerns generated by the social and economic development status of the region or country selected data from the koehler et al survey are shown in appendix  table  indicates the eleven values presented to respondents respondents were asked to rank order the first three most important to themselves the row labeled rated indicated the percent of the sample that ranked each value as one of the top three thus almost three quarters of the sample identified service to the patron as their first second or third order value the row labeled first indicated the proportion of the sample that identified each value as their first order value those rows labeled second and third are those values so identified that some proportion of the sample did not rate a given value as among the top three not rated cannot be interpreted to mean that the respondents found them to be unimportant indeed these values are recognized as part of the information professionals culture the ranking simply reflects priorities table  shows the distribution by regions again patron service is rated and selected first by librarians in all regions variation occurs for the second and third most frequently rated and first selected values but these tend to be variations among a small set of the values  information literacy equality of access preservation of the intellectual record literacy and information literacy table  shows the distribution of values by librarian type librarians are employed in a variety of settings the terms in the table may require some definition government librarians are those employed by official government agencies and ministries but exclude most independent libraries including national libraries k  librarians are librarians working in primary and secondary schools special librarians are employed in the private sector to support corporate interests and professional practices these are librarians employed by companies etc for purposes of this table special librarians do not include medical or legal librarians these two groups of special librarians are listed separately

   journal of education for library and information science differences in legal practice that result from common law and civil code traditions there is an assumption for example in most common law countries that the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty but once convicted presumed guilty until proven innocent in most civil jurisdictions the accused is presumed guilty in the united states it is generally ethical for those not directly associated with a given case to discuss it before it is decided in the united kingdom the discussion of any case subjudici by anyone is unethical and even where a single set of values might be expressed the emphasis or order placed on those values is necessarily different instead society is well served by study and analysis of existing ethics codes and published studies of the ethical codes and precepts of professionals and the professions these findings have two fold significance in the training of lis professionals the first is to recognize that a set of core values exists and that lis professionals worldwide recognize similar values on its face this statement is somewhat controversial for example berleur and brunnstein argue no specific set of ethical principles exists internationally for the computing community on the other hand rubin and froehlich and froehlich have enumerated ethical principles of the library community koehler and pemberton argue that if codes of ethics are sufficiently abstracted a syncretic code can be created dole et al and koehler et al point to a core set of core values but also demonstrate that there are differences in the order and application of those values the second significance is to stress that as in many other things the order in which these core values are recognized is a case of form following function there is a good deal of variability and it is important that emerging new lis professionals recognize and appreciate these differences based on the work of the authors cited in this paper and many others we should perhaps not seek to inculcate a specific rigid code of ethics but rather to expose our students to the range of thinking in the field to that end we can expose our students to important writings in the field and to the various codes of ethics of professional organizations references and notes   martha m smith information ethics in annual review of information science and technology ed martha e williams      see for example nicholas negroponte being digital new york knopf  joel rudinow and anthony graybosch ethics and values in the information age new york  or readings in cyberethics eds richard a spinello and herman t tavani sudbury mass jones and bartlett pub   for a list of professional organizations with links to ethics codes mission statements and statutes see ethics links to librarian and information manager associations www pages available at httpvbooksvaldostapeachnetedumlisethicsethicsbiborghtm  wallace c koehler and j michael pemberton a search for core values towards a model code of ethics for information professionals journal of information ethics      milton rokeach the nature of human values new york free press   michael gorman our enduring values librarianship in the st century chicago american library association
