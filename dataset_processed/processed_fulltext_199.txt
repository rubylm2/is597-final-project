the bibliotheque nationale during the last decade fundamental changes and constructive achievement jos meyer t nhe wealth and variety of collections in french libraries have always attracted foreign visitors but the difficulties encountered when working in institutions far behind the times in material equipment and research facilities have often discouraged their patient efforts americans in particular have been frequent visitors to the national library of france and they know well the obstacles with which their search for information has been beset they remember the complicated catalogs which could not be used without the help of a guide and their astonishment at the lack of intellectual and material conveniences that are an integral part of their own libraries organized solely with a view to facilitating the task of the research worker the purpose of these notes is to report on the efforts made over a period of ten years to modernize a great institution with several centuries of traditions and thus enable it to hold its rank among the world great centers of learning situation of the bibliothhque nationale in  the general situation of the bibliothaque nationale in  was such as to cause grave concern for its future in spite of all the efforts of its active and enterprising administrator m roland marcel there had been some improvements of course in i a law had been passed tightening the provisions of the legal deposit act this resulted in increased effectiveness and a more universal compliance with its clauses ln i an agreement had been reached with certain large american libraries making it possible to speed up the preparation and publication of the catalogue gnral a grant from the rockefeller foundation in  had pro

the bibliotheque nationale  needfor a general reformin the course of its long history the bibliotheque nationale has experienced several periods of financial stringency alternating with brief spells of prosperity the first half of the nineteenth century can be described as a perpetual crisis growing worse from decade to decade until a great administrator taschereau assisted by a great architect labrouste undertook a basic transformation extending their plan of alterations over a period of twenty years from i to  these two men gave the bibliotheque nationale the exterior appearance which it retains today then for a span of fifty five years the library lived on the impetus received during those twenty years of extensive rebuilding again in the course of these last ten years a fresh impulse has been given which has affected every department of the library and which it is hoped will leave a lasting influence the charge of the administrator general of the bibliotheque nationale grew more and more complex as the number of departments increased and their scope became ever wider during the ten years of m julien cain administration from may i  to july  i a number of new services were established and the field of action of existing departments was greatly expanded this period may best be characterized as one of farreaching material technical and intellectual change the last determining the first as befits a scholarly institution changes in the general organization the addition of four important new departments to the traditional four divisions of the bibliotheque nationale is one of the outstanding events of the last ten years first the bibliotheque mazarine was brought under the administration of the national library in i the arsenal library in i the music libraries of the opera and of the conservatory of music in  and finally in  the documentation center formerly connected with the ministry of commerce and the ministry of national economy at the same time the department of printed books the most important in the library added a number of new services to the traditional forms of library service and extended to
o the library q_uarterly research workers vastly improved facilities which included newly opened reading rooms equipped with all the instruments of study the complexities of the task of administering an institution of this type bound in many ways by its historical background and deep rooted traditions while striving to keep abreast of modern needs can be referred to only in passing when the bibliotheque nationale was granted civil personality and financial autonomy under the control of the minister of finance this step meant a more flexible financial organization for the library but at the same time additional heavy responsibility for the administrator general in particular when he was intrusted with the financial management of the fund set aside for structural alterations financially in  the situation of the bibliotheque nationale was greatly improved the regular income from the ordinary budget was provided by the government appropriation totaling s francs about s in i and  francs in i about oo the exceptional or temporary income was derived from the extraordinary budget this made special funds available for major building operations as part of a large scale plan for public works and for the relief of unemployment a special contribution from the caisse de la recherche scientifique the national research fund covered the cost of publishing the various catalogs in book form these extraordinary credits made it possible to carry out over a period of years certain carefully established plans for important construction work and architectural alterations of existing buildings on the one hand and certain scholarly enterprises on the other structural changes and new buildings the number of problems arising in connection with the planned rejuvenation of the library was so great and the problems were all so interwoven that it became necessary to establish an order of precedence according to their relative urgency the problem of space in the opinion of m cain was the root of most of the library difficulties if the collections were to be
the bibliotheque nactionale  preserved for posterity and the work organized judiciously and profitably a thorough modernization of existing conveniences and the construction of additional quarters were urgently needed the execution and partial completion of these two parallel plans was made possible only through additional funds taken on a large scale from the special government appropriation for public works made available in addition to the regular amount from the ordinary budget these extraordinary funds were granted three times in  i and  for the purpose of carrying out a previously established all embracing plan approved by the government since the quarters of the department of medals were the most recent and fairly satisfactory it was decided to concentrate all efforts on the other departments those of manuscripts prints and above all the department of printed books here the problems arising from the huge quantity of books awaiting the various processes of library routine before being stored for preservation were of the most serious nature the lack of space had produced a degree of disorder and confusion which threatened to engulf the other services as well the methods to be used were of course primarily determined by existing conditions since the library building is bounded by four completely built up streets in the center of paris any kind of expansion in a horizontal direction was out of the question new space had to be found in depth and after sufficient consolidation of existing foundations height could be added in the process of this operation the old cellars were thoroughly transformed and made into a series of modern book stacks to which a number of well planned offices were added in the basement construction work was continued without interruption from  to  and with only minor delays even after the outbreak of war most of the complicated operations were carried out simultaneously as a result the whole interior of the library was completely transformed in a relatively short time these major alterations were made while all the library services continued as usual not the least among the difficulties to be overcome the final result of this work of adaptation is a series of
io the libracry quarterly modern rooms within a historic shell for reasons of architectural style the outer walls were left untouched everywhere general equipment of the buildingno doubt the american public used to its own up to the minute libraries will be amazed to learn that the most urgent alterations at the bibliotheque nationale concerned the lighting system heat the telephone freight elevators and the like of all of these there were only rudiments in  it was not until  that electric light was installed in the department of printed books all other departments of the library remained dependent on daylight with resulting irregular and often far too brief working hours an electric lighting system is now laid in the entire building including all the stacks this makes it possible for readers to consult books from any collection during the entire day a powerful transformer and an emergency generator were installed underground under the central courtyard as for heating the various old coal burning furnaces always a potential fire threat were replaced by a modern thermo center which was also placed underground this is fed by hot air from the central city heating plant chauffage central urbain the installation was completed by a scientific ventilation and air conditioning system to reduce the fire hazard as much as possible various fireproofing processes were applied they are too technical to be described here but the fireproof stairs throughout the metal doors isolating different sections of the building in case of fire and all metal elevators and shafts may be mentioned finally extensive sanitary improvements were made for both the staff and the public the staff was also provided with locker rooms showers and a lunchroom the new reading rooms of the department of printed books the main reading room totally inadequate for years could not be enlarged for architectural reasons instead a solution for the problem of overcrowding was sought by providing additional seating space elsewhere while the reference collection was gradually rounded out so as to answer the needs of a larger number of readers and research workers four new reading rooms were organized and almost immediately it was found that the service
the bibliotheque nitionale ii in general was much facilitated these were the new reading rooms a the catalog and bibliography room b the rare book room commonly known as reserve c the periodical reading room and d the reading room in the versailles annex altogether counting the geography room the department of printed books now has six reading rooms the catalog and bibliography room was opened to the public in  and considerably enlarged three years later it is located under the general reading room with which it is connected by a double staircase in it has been brought together a collection of bibliographical reference tools which it is believed is unique in europe although inspired in part by the auskunftsbureau der deutschen bibliotheken in berlin its total conception is novel and more suitable for the french research worker the nucleus of the reference collection consists of all the catalogs of the bibliotheque nationale and catalogs of other libraries french and foreign the most important of which is the library of congress depository card catalog arranged by classification numbers in addition to these all the bibliographical material formerly dispersed in the various sections and stacks of the bibliotheque nationale has been grouped in this room arranged by subjects a unique feature is the so called central documentation index on cards which was begun in  arranged as a dictionary catalog it includes cards for all the bibliotheque nationale catalogs and collections for outside libraries and research centers their collections and specialization bibliographies and since january i i analyticals for french and foreign library and bibliographical periodicals the underlying idea was to provide a bibliography of bibliographies in card form supplemented by oral information the newly opened rare book room conveniently located between the general reading room and the rare book stack was designed particularly for the use of scholars its reference collection contains chiefly works dealing with the history of printing book illustration and bibliophily provisionally it is used also for work in connection with the music collection ultimately it was planned to organize a separate room for music
i the library quarterly the periodical room usually referred to as hemerotheque de paris was finally installed in the huge oval room which had seen various fortunes since work on it was begun at the turn of the century a public reading room for a time with a direct entrance from the street it was closed when attendance dwindled later work was resumed and it was remodeled to serve as a newspaper and periodical reading room there had been a great need for a separate periodical room as previously only one table in the general reading room had been set aside for current periodicals its oval shape once the subject of bitter criticism proved to be peculiarly suitable for the display of some six thousand current periodicals grouped by subject any of these can be obtained within a few minutes the adjoining stack is used for the larger part of the eighteenthand nineteenthcentury daily newspapers of paris the provincial newspapers on the other hand are stored in the new versailles annex readers find in the oval room a comprehensive collection of reference books on current topics which includes a large group of yearbooks directories dictionaries encyclopedias and manuals of the various branches of knowledge processing rooms and officesfor the stafffor the first time in the history of the bibliotheque nationale adequate space was provided for the preliminary handling and sorting of the immense flood of books and periodicals pouring steadily into the library a system of alcoves and specially designed shelving were planned to facilitate provisional sorting and distribution of the material modern offices with up to date equipment were provided for the librarians and library assistants in order to make the recording of newly acquired material more speedy and more efficient the cardex and related indexing methods were introduced chiefly for periodicals and continuations the section of legal deposit which receives the entire output of the french publishing and printing industries was reorganized in spacious and scientifically planned quarters conveniently located near the entrance of the building remodeling of the central stackthe central book stack built before  by labrouste had long been considered a model of
the bibliotheque nationale  its kind however contrary to expectations it soon proved inadequate for the mass of incoming books various expedients tending to increase the available storage space such as additional shelving in the aisles were attempted but failed to solve the problem for more than a short while when all other possibilities had been exhausted the attics were used for storage purposes a most dangerous and impractical solution certain alterations in the central stack had been undertaken in the twenties and were completed after  the newly acquired space was however woefully insufficient for any length of time only a major structural operation could provide the necessary space for the coming years this operation consisted in the construction of a huge two story underground stack under the old central book stack and along the two flanks of the building facing the rue de richelieu and the rue des petits champs simultaneously new and more powerful foundations were built to support not only the additional weight of the underground stacks but also sometime in the future additions in height to the central stack this technically difficult operation was carried out like all the other alterations without a day interruption of the regular library service coincidentally entire collections had to be shifted several times this provided the opportunity for a more systematic and at the same time more practical arrangement of the books which in turn resulted in more efficient service to the readers newly installed book carriers elevators and a system of pneumatic tubes for transmission of request slips from the reading room to both old and new stacks contributed much to the generally recognized improvement of the service altogether in the course of these alterations some  kilometers i miles of new shelving were made available the versailles annexthe problem of space for printed matter could not be solved in a permanent manner within the bibliotheque nationale following the example of the british museum it was decided to transfer certain bulky and little used collections including provincial newspaper files and secondary periodicals of purely local interest from the library building in
 the library quarterly paris to an annex this was built not in paris where no suitable site was available but in versailles architecturally this structure is a departure from traditional conceptions its style is strictly functional there are eight stories two of which are basement floors with daylight partly provided through the use of so called english yards areas an adjacent vacant lot of considerable size was to be used eventually for four additional buildings connected by galleries this scheme permitted a single service division for all the buildings representing a considerable saving in personnel the first of these buildings was completed in  it contains  kilometers  miles of stacks with a reading room for readers wishing to use the collections on the spot however this material is used more often in paris since there is a regular daily motor service between the library in paris and the versailles annex the manuscripts departmentthe department of manuscripts which is equaled in wealth only by the british museum demanded its share of improvements since part of its priceless collections was still stored in attics the upper part of a wing giving onto the court of honor was therefore rebuilt and lined with concrete in such a way as to resemble a huge safe affording the maximum protection against fire as well as against theft any abnormal increase in temperature automatically starts off an extinguishing mechanism using a neutral gas absolutely harmless to documents a number of extra decks in this section provide ample storage space for some time to come the department of printsthe alterations in this wing were by far the boldest and on a larger scale than any of the previously described operations first the larger part of the print collection was temporarily moved to the mansion of salomon de rothschild which had long housed the art and archeology library next a group of old buildings without architectural character were demolished leaving only the fasade standing this was the only portion dating back to the middle of the seventeenth century behind this period setting work was begun on a modern structure specifically designed for its purpose eight

i the library quarterly ber of books annually deposited excluding periodicals music and maps which are reckoned separately amounts to about  items deposits of periodicals were much improved following the law of december   which called for deposit directly with the bibliotheque nationale indirectly the completion of the new periodical reading room and the opening of the versailles annex for storage contributed to this improvement since they made possible a more effective system of checking lacunae book purchases were steadily increased as a result of consistently larger appropriations these funds were used primarily to build up collections of foreign books and periodicals and to continue series it was felt that the bibliotheque nationale should continue to fulfil its function of advancing learning and scholarship and must build for the future leaving to the many specialized libraries of paris the task of acquiring special monographs and publications of temporary interest the department was given an opportunity to bid at several important auction sales and to purchase a number of rare and valuable books for its reserve year after year many generous gifts came to this department from both french and foreign individuals and from several institutions as well the bibliotheque nationale regularly exchanged its publications with certain foreign publications the maps and music sections spared no effort to build up systematically their modern collections they were fortunate in securing a number of rare items which in recent times have usually gone to private collectors the outstanding acquisitions of those last years however were made by the department of manuscripts all its collections were enriched but most of all its collection of french manuscripts certain groups of documents acquired such as registers chartularies charters political papers and correspondence are important for french historical research among these may be mentioned the letters of marshal turenne those of rewbell a member of the revolutionary convention and those of general boulanger of a more general historical interest are letters of

i the library quarterly and whenever possible the publications were bound ways and means were found to bind not only all current accessions but also part of the accumulated arrears the appropriation for binding previously amounting to o francs was increased to  francs however the situation in this respect remains very serious and special measures will have to be taken if the collections are to be preserved for posterity catalogs and bibliographical projects the learned character of an institution like the bibliotheque nationale should find its expression in the scholarly work which it produces and above all in the catalogs which its staff prepares and publishes from this point of view the years from  to  were one of the most productive periods in its history a distinction should be made between work of this type intended merely for internal use and that which is of interest to scholars at large all librarians are duty bound to catalog the books intrusted to their care but only collections of exceptional value or rarity call for the publication of catalogs in the form of printed volumes the task of the bibliotheque nationale was therefore twofold on the one hand all current finding lists card catalogs and indexes were constantly improved on the other hand a number of catalogs were published which may be regarded as scholarly contributions to the best type of library literature the cost of printing these catalogs amounted to about  francs in i this amount was doubled in  department of printed booksthe bibliographie de la france is the only official catalog of current french book production the bibliographical compilation was done at the bibliotheque nationale while the cercle de la librairie was in charge of the publishing a serious effort was made to meet the justified criticism concerning its shortcomings following the reform of the system of legal deposit in  it was possible to cut down the delay in listing new publications since deposit was being effected more promptly and more universally the number of pages was increased and there were included special sections for music maps prints translations from foreign languages new
the bibliotheque nationale  periodicals and doctoral dissertations the latter since october  several indexes particularly a systematic index should facilitate the use of this repertory an attempt was made in  to print the entries separately on cards of standard international size to be used by other libraries for their catalogs but lack of funds made it necessary to interrupt the experiment the bulletin des acquisitions etrangeres had been discontinued in i owing to lack of funds it was resumed in  and the intervening gap was filled in a few years special numbers were published for exceptionally large shipments of publications received from canada and the argentine republic between  and  sixty one volumes of the catalogue general des livres imprime xcviii clviii covering entries from liell to rukser were published at the time war broke out the end of this huge bibliographical enterprise begun in i  was in sight had it been possible to maintain the output of the preceding years the catalog would now be completed the agreement reached in i by m roland marcel with a group of american libraries and the subsequent financial assistance from the rockefeller foundation went far toward helping achieve this goal it was the policy of m cain administration to facilitate in every possible way the work of research in the bibliotheque nationale this could best be achieved by simplifying the complicated system of catalogs to this end the following operations were carried out a the three series of catalogs for authors and anonymous works   i i and i were consolidated into a single alphabet b a catalog of literary works by title was established c beginning with  all entries were made on cards of standard international format and d beginning with i the catchword catalog was replaced by a subject catalog arranged systematically of the special catalogs both the index to the previously published catalogue de istoire de france and the index to the catalogue des factums  anterieurs a j were completed work was resumed on isnard catalogue des actes royaux and
