a repositioning librarians how young people view the information sector roma harris and margaret ann wilkinson this paper was presented at the alise  annual conference more than  students entering their first year of university studies completed questionnaires about the work roles future employment prospects educational requirements status and starting salaries of twelve occupations their responses were compared with us and canadian government labor force projections the results revealed a complex interplay of gender relations in the students perceptions of the occupational world and their roles within it the results also revealed an interesting positioning of the job title librarian relative to other fields unlike their assessment of the other occupations included in the study the students considerably underestimated the level of education required to be a librarian most did not believe that librarians require a university education they also underestimated librarians average starting salary and rated the occupation social status and future prospects to be lower than the other job titles taken together the results indicate that young people beginning their university studies hold views about career prospects in the information sector that are consistent with some laborforce analysts views of occupational winners and losers the students see status opportunity and success to be attainable in fields such as computer engineering and systems analysis unfortunately they view the occupational present and future for librarians in a somewhat dimmer light a worrisome result in view of labor force data that suggest reasonably strong salary and employment opportunities for this occupation in both the united states and canada the implications of these findings for library and information science lis education are discussed in the context of gender and identity politics introduction to say that librarianship is in a state of flux could hardly be more of an understatement rarely is an issue of a library and information science journal released in which concerns aren expressed about the pace and meaning of change and the future of libraries and the profession for instance commenting on a study about public libraries estabrook observed that library leaders are optimistic but anxious they see opportunities for public libraries to marry traditional services with digital formats but worry how libraries can find a competitive niche in the rapidly changing information environment they recognize the potential for libraries to provide new services and educate people to use new technologies yet fear there is no broad leadership in the profession to meet the challenges of competition and change not surprisingly there is no consensus if there is no consensus among library leaders it is not surprising that the public too is unclear about the future of libraries according to estabrook the public view of libraries is complicated to assess and fall

repositioning librarians   ration where specialized researchers may not have noticed them they will simultaneously define new landscapes of technical services and new services for users van house and sutton have taken a more extreme position claiming that the traditional focus of lis practice and education on the library as an enterprise and an institution largely remains the controlling factor in defining the arena of professional practice in the eyes of both the profession members and the public this is true despite the broad potential application of this knowledge base in a range of contexts beyond the library eg business and government a trend in lis education toward expanding its market to other information functions and organizations and the decline in library jobs especially those in the public and quasi public sectors such as public and university libraries they propose that to survive lis education needs to further decouple itself from libraries because without a rapid response and fundamental change lis education is likely to go the way of pandas cute well loved coddled andnearing extinction and while not exactly predicting extinction whitney says of the declining membership in the association for library and information science education while emorrhaging may be an overstatement at this time eaky boat is not given what seems to be a sense of impending catastrophe it is not surprising that around the world schools that have traditionally prepared librarians for entry to the profession are being reshaped for example the florida state university school of information studies prior to  the school of library and information studies has started a new program leading to an undergraduate degree in information studies according to sherron and landry this new program emphasizes the user perspective as well as the use of information technology and the the information studies graduate is a facilitator of access to information at the university of california at berkeley the school of information management and systems is the transmogrification of what was formerly berkeley school of library and information studies the school web site makes the following declaration the information revolution has created the need for a new kind of professional someone who is skilled in locating organizing manipulating filtering and presenting information the mission of the school of information management and systems is to educate such information managers in australia the department of information management and library studies at the royal melbourne institute of technology rmit has undergone fundamental changes in mission and objectives since the mid s and now has been repositioned to attract students who are more technically and commercially oriented than our traditional lis entrants by focusing on knowledge management programs in one of these programs a graduate diploma in document management knowledge management students analyze the nature of knowledge its characteristics and its role and significance in a business environment knowledge management has also been adopted as an emphasis in the school of information and media at the robert gordon university in aberdeen scotland along with programs in information and library studies the school houses a centre of knowledge management with a mission to enable organizations to build sustainable competitive advantage through management of knowledge in  at the university of pretoria in south africa the department of information science having earlier changed its name from the department of library and information science was integrated into the school of information technology the school offers undergraduate programs leading to a bachelor in internet studies bis in library and information science publishing information science or multimedia fall 
 journal of education for library and information science bothma and britz describe the transition as one of moving from a fairly traditional lis school to an open department that offers extensive opportunities to any information professional as well as to all other students who need information skills to obtain a competitive advantage in a predominantly information based industry what is behind these global changes in approach to the field according to van house and sutton lis is engaged in a struggle with other professions and academic disciplines both for jurisdiction over the information functions that have traditionally been the problem domain of lis and of the emerging information functions brought about by changes in technology and society the primary reasons for this struggle are twofold first changes in computing and telecommunications and second the increasing strategic importance of information in our economy and in society more generally of course the struggle for turf and economic power in the information society goes far beyond the roles of libraries and librarianship as hamelink writes world communication politics is increasingly defined by trade and market standards and ever less by political considerations there is a noticeable shift from a predominantly political discourse to a largely economic trade discourse    and the locus of much policy making shifted from governments to associations of private business sectors indeed hamelink notes it is no surprise that information and communication technology governance is shifting to a global trade forum given the increasing economic value of communication networks and information services  taking up a similar theme birdsall and rasmussen argue that national information policies that encourage citizen access to the information highway seem to have as their main motivation the preparation of citizens to be consumers rather than effective political actors according to hamelink the globalization of the new world order is characterized by social darwinism and fragmentation    greatly facilitated by a conservative libertarian belief system that is broadcast widely across the globe by the world largest communication conglomerates these conglomerates are becoming increasingly powerful in shaping our thoughts as bagdikian points out a handful of mammoth private organizations have begun to dominate the world mass media these lords of the global village have their own political agenda all resist economic changes that do not support their own financial interests together they exert a homogenizing power over ideas culture and commerce that affects populations larger than any in history just what are some of these ideas one key notion is that of privatization ie that the world resources are basically private property and that public affairs should be regulated by private parties on free markets a notion clearly extant for example in the development of national information policies the ubiquitous presence of business interests in the form of transnational corporations restricts the policy options of national governments especially those in the developing world in countries such as india local business elites push for economic liberalization and the opportunity to collaborate with transnational corporations while at the same time benefiting from cheap local labor and infrastructure in other words they support liberal trade policies and conservative even regressive labor policies the result in india where there is enormous national support for the information economy after nearly a decade of work in a liberalized economy is that the vast majority of indian workers in the information economy are subject to the global race to the bottom in wages and unprecedented price hikes for basic goods and services in this setting a more probable future for the majority of those employed in india information economy is work as part of the expanding volume  number 
repositioning librarians  disposable labor force labor practices in india information sector are also seen in some american hightech industries as colclough and tolbert observe one important source of flexibility utilized by high tech industries and many other industries is geographic movement or capital mobility by subdividing the production process into standardized components that require limited worker skill to complete firms can relocate later stages of production to areas where labor costs and lower andor new markets are emerging in many cases the new source of labor may be offshore the result is a two tiered occupational structure in hightech industries  the rapidly expanding top tier of management technical engineering and research and development personnel in the united states is congruent with    primary labor market jobs  good jobs high pay extensive benefits and avenues for mobility the labor intensive production tier of many high tech firms exhibits classic characteristics of secondary labor markets  low skill low wages few benefits little job security and limited opportunities for mobility it is these secondary labor market jobs in which women and increasingly racial and ethnic minorities are employed libraries are also affected by trends in the new economy as hildenbrand indicates the information industry a major winner in the new economy has an impact on libraries in two ways it lobbies vigorously for a tax structure that is inhospitable to all institutions that rely on public support and also it markets its products as efficient time saving and labor saving making them attractive to underfunded public bureaucracies and gifts none of which are free if processing and learning time are calculated are judiciously made to build allegiance to particular systems underfunding combined with aggressive marketing of new information technologies has had an impact on how public institutions are managed in health care for example the term orporatization has been used to characterize the entrance of large capitalist corporations into the production of medical services the development of alternative provider organizations and the reorganization of community hospitals through the introduction of more rationalized systems of management and bureaucratic control similarly in social work globalization has provided the impetus for the move away from publicly funded welfare provisions to commercial enterprises run by private entrepreneurs loss of a public service ethic reduction in the power and influence wielded by professionals in determining welfare policy and provisions and a deprofessionalization of professional skills the complexities of social work have been fragmented by managerial practices through which tasks are divided into discrete components which can be done by workers holding lower level qualifications a situation that enables employers to control workers more easily and pay them less the result has been that a profession which suffered from a low professional status because it has been considered women work has a workforce made up largely of women although men control its higher managerial echelons and is relatively undertrained and underpaid as a result has been forced even further downward in the professional status stakes similar managerial strategies and resulting deprofessionalization have also been reported in librarianship see for example harris and marshall as winter explains librarianship presents a case in which a number of functions originally assigned and carried out internally have now split off into newer occupational groups which have grown so much that they are now taking over substantial parts of the old ualitative domain the most dramatic example is the fall

 journal of education for library and information science pool expressed a clear preference to work in the private rather than the public sector in which they believe the majority of librarians are employed furthermore among the information professions they situate librarianship as a woman occupation with poor career prospects little status and low earnings potential the students views suggest that the repackaging of librarians skills under the labels information professional internet researcher or knowledge manager may position the occupation more favorably but at what cost will attracting new entrants to a field positioned as a private sector information profession yield any librarians ie skilled people willing to work in libraries and will shedding the profession feminized label and emphasizing high technology enable current lis workers to overcome status problems and reap the rewards of the burgeoning information economy henwood reported no evidence to suggest that women are benefiting from the widespread diffusion of the new technologies through increased access to ew technology jobs  whilst it is the case that women are finding their way into some new areas of work as a result of these changes these are new areas of omen work with all the low status and lack of prospects that such segregation implies henwood  observations highlight the fact that the way in which jobs come to be recognized as requiring skills or involving responsibilities is a social and not a technically determined process in fact differences in skill and job content are not the main cause of the differences in pay between men and women full time women workers are  systematically lower paid than men after adjusting for any differences in skill composition of jobs in other words as long as women are present in any significant numbers in an occupation regardless of the technical skills required in their jobs the work they do will come to be devalued relative to those occupations or sectors in which men predominate in the current study the students perceptions albeit sometimes exaggerated match the reality of trends in the emerging information society for instance their views are consistent with representations of the future in advertisements for information technology products in which women are often depicted either as mere onlookers in the presence of new technologies or in menial routine work roles whereas men are often portrayed to be controlling technologies in their roles as visionaries who are crafting the future dilevko results and the findings of the present study raise troubling questions about the future of women and women work in the new economy two aspects of current discourse about lis education bear thinking about in light of this study the first is the connection between new high tech information programs and the preparation for private sector work just as hamelink bagdikian and others suggest the political agenda of transnational corporate interests seems to have been successful in persuading young people and members of the lis community to valorize the private sector over the public the second is the relationship between the presence or absence of women and the future of particular types of information work just as in dominelli and hoogvelt description of the transformation of british social work it appears that the type of information work typically performed by women librarians is increasingly regarded as a thing of the past and may be destined to be deskilled and relegated to the low paid lowstatus realm of the public sector references and notes   leigh s  estabrook polarized perceptions library journal feb     ibid    ibid   ibid   robert newton and david dixon new volume  number
