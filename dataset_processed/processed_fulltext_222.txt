theory of bibliographic control in libraries doralyn j hickey the phrase theory of bibliographic control evokes considerable interest among librarians partly because they are not sure that any theory exists and partly because they wish that it did the skepticism which young american librarians often express concerning bibliographic theory may be typical of those who have witnessed the development of elaborate cataloging systems observed their contradictions and inconsistencies and concluded that librarianship in the united states at least is long on bibliographic control and woefully short on theory the thesis of this paper is that american librarianship suffers not from a lack of bibliographic theory but from a multiplicity of theories further it is contended that these theories reflect the history and social setting of the united states in order to present this point of view systematically and comment upon it this paper will address itself first to the distinctively american context out of which our current bibliographic systems emerged second to the dual structure of library catalogs and published bibliographies which characterizes american attempts to control materials and third to some contemporary questions the answers to which may help in the development of a coherent theory of bibliographic control in the united states american commitment to free education despite the american mythology which suggests that all colonists were patriots it is clear that the american revolution did not eliminate all loyalists any more than it eradicated all memories of the anglo european backgrounds of its participants whether they were aware of it or not the colonists brought with them a heritage of experience with educational systems which conditioned their early history in many ways these earlier traditions conflicted quite radically with the subsequent commitment of the country to the ideal of freedom for self education it has taken the united states the better part of  years to sort out all of the consequences of this kind of freedom to build a system of publicly supported schools and libraries not reserved for the intellectually or financially elite libraty qyzrterly vol  no  pp    by the university of chicago all right reserved 
 doralyn j hickey although the danger of oversimplification is always present in such an analysis at least three traditions can be highlighted as coming to the united states from england and europe which had to be challenged before freedom for self education could become a reality one of these was the concept of an intellectual aristocracy a naturally endowed small group of potential leaders who should be educated for the public benefit and served by those less gifted under this concept resources and materials of learning need be made available only to this small group and the general public far from requiring access to these resources could quite possibly be harmed by them under this concept it could be expected that library access would be restricted and the collections carefully preserved for the intelligentsia of the present and the future a second anglo european tradition was the privilege of power not only did the paraphernalia of learning belong to the naturally endowed it also signified the financial advantages attained by those who controlled the political social and economic systems of the country thus the rich surrounded themselves with books and art objects to show that power and culture were if not synonymous certainly closely related such a concept builds libraries in the homes of the leaders but does not stimulate the development of public collections the citation of the third tradition that of the renaissance man as the ideal role in society is susceptible to misinterpretation insofar as the renaissance model stimulated the well rounded development of the human mind it may be viewed as a desirable goal of a democratic society its interpretation however sometimes tended to emphasize scholarship for its own sake as contrasted with the practical utility of learning a trade while this distortion of the renaissance should not be seen as the only influence in the united states it did set up another distinction between the ordinary man and the educated man again encouraging the establishment of libraries for those who could appreciate them rather than for those who might abuse or ignore them against this background americans began to develop the idea of freedom with its rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the struggles to establish freedom of the press in the united states reflected the tensions created by the emerging concept of liberty for all a young nation largely dependent upon england and europe for its books and bibliographic systems inexperienced in dispensing either education or information equipped with few technical skills and little machinery could hardly be blamed for its failure to propose a bold new program of open access to the materials of learning despite the inexperience americans of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries often seemed at least to the rest of the world to exude a spirit of optimism in the land of the free and the home of the brave there could be no goal too lofty to propose and no tradition too sacred to be challenged if the people were to elect thelr representatives then they certainly needed the opportunity for education if they were to provide the nation with the tools of

 doralyn j hickey many library users that the librarian ought to be able to say without looking whether the library contains a given work the now classic argument concerning the catalog as a finding list versus the catalog as a bibliographic record generally posed no problem in the early days of american libraries without doubt the kind of incomplete and all too often inaccurate holdings lists found in libraries during the s served as no more than location devices it fell to systematic thinkers such as charles cutter  melvil dewey j and charles jewett  to improve and systematize them although a certain amount of consistency was mandatory in the creation of the printed catalog utilized by a number of major libraries there is little question that the gradual rise of the card file introduced the need for standardization at a more rapid rate the orderly minds of catalogers rebelled against the failure of the lists to collocate works by the same author they believed that if it was necessary to select a consistent approach to such works within a library it would certainly do no harm to establish the correct form of the author name the anglo european heritage reinforced the emphasis upon listing works under the name of the personal author while increasing interest in the personal history of authors made it easier to find or establish a standard form of reference to their names the standardization of names led naturally to the insertion of references from unused forms to those adopted for the catalog eventually these practices were adopted widely enough to permit their being recorded in a manual thus each new cataloger was no longer forced to retrace the steps of a predecessor in order to learn the assumptions on which the catalog had been developed cutter rules and dewey manual fed into the activities of the american library association and eventually resulted in the  anglo american code  as rules were being formulated and transmitted questions were also being answered concerning the subject arrangement of the catalog in this area the european heritage was ambiguous although a slight edge might have been accorded to the classed catalog as the form most likely to be dominant there was however something inherently democratic about the dictionary catalog which probably appealed to the american mind certainly american librarians did not invent the alphabetic ordering of catalog data but they did perfect its use classed catalogs presumed a knowledge of the hierarchy of learning alphabetic catalogs could be utilized by anyone able to read it is interesting to note nonetheless that the vestiges of classification abounded  the basic functions of the library catalog are dicussed definitively in sec  of the so called paris principles j see also   for a history of the movement toward standardization of cataloging entries see  for an analysis of the problems created by american cataloging practices see   for a contrast of the american interest in monolithic catalogs with the traditions of european catalogs see

 doralyn j hickey what then were the basic bibliographic problems encountered in the development of library catalogs first since it was regularly assumed that all catalogs must represent the complete holdings of the repository in a single alphabetically arranged file it was imperative that consistent rules for entry be stated and observed this consistency generally did not have to extend beyond the individual library file as library collections began to look more alike however and catalogers found that they could save money and time by purchasing bibliographic records from a central source the requirement for simple internal consistency gave way to that of consistency both internally and with the central source that is with the library of congress lc those who could not afford lc cards or who chose to ignore them were free to pursue their own brand of cataloging but they were without doubt influenced by lc services the entry approach of lc and its dependent libraries followed the renaissance theme credit the individual with the works which that person has written although american life developed corporate trends in authorship and despite the fact that many materials could hardly be said to have been authored by anyone emphasis upon the individual creative scholar persisted at least in library catalogs an example of the confusion to which this emphasis can lead was provided by one library which divided its catalog in the s although its three part catalog was labeled author title and subject a library user reported that he was totally unable to find either in the author file or in the title file a listing of a work known to be in the collection further examination of the problem indicated that the user had looked in the author file under the name of the editor of the work then he looked under the title in the title file with no success at either point an enterprising reference librarian explained the confusion it seems that the author file was actually an official main entry list the work sought happened to have been given the title as the main entry and hence the title  an interesting case study illustrating the problems occasioned by introducing a computerbased book catalog production sytem is found in j  the dependence of american libraries particularly academic libraries upon the library of congres once that library had begun to distribute its catalog cards is fully described and documented in   since the pnssian instructions failed to recognize corporate bodies as authors there was considerable difficulty in reconciling the prussian and anglo american cataloging traditions a major hurdle was passed in the negotiations resulting in the paris principles of  when it was agreed that international sanction be given the category of corporate author unfortunately it has taken some fifteen years of further consideration to discover that no one really knows how to define a corporate author at present the joint steering committee engaged in revising the  anglo american cataloging rules has tentatively agreed not to try to define corporate author but instead to define situations of responsibility which give rise to corporate main entry for an exhaustive analysis of the problem see

 doralyn j hickey difficulties associated with establishment of author headings were compounded when the author was corporate rather than individual while american society shifted its attention from the individual to the group librarians clung for a long time to an inconsistent body of rules designed to strike a balance between entering a corporate entity under its official name and establishing it under a popular or commonly cited name moves during the s to eliminate most indirect forms of corporate heading produced great resistance among librarians and raised perplexing questions about the basic function of the catalog was it designed to serve an untutored user a scholarly client a dedicated reference librarian or a sophisticated catalog librarian was it supposed to cumulate indefinitely and resist change or was it a tool of the society that created it and should change at least as rapidly as society itself adjusted to new demands as if these challenges were not enough questions arose which suggested that librarians had not even been anticipating user needs successfully all kinds of catalog access points were examined for their potential value it is almost staggering to recount various suggestions for revision they included  standardizing all main entry approaches by utilizing the title of the work as the basic unit of information the so called unit entry   abandoning attempts to regularize or standardize forms of personal and corporate names and resolving serious conflicts simply by developing appropriate syndetics  eliminating or drastically modifying the alphabetical subject approach   dropping the distinction between types of access points main entry added entry subject headings  and relying more upon machine based coordination of access terms and  rejecting directly and unambiguously the traditional bibliographic function of the individual library catalog in favor of developing effective and responsive finding lists the problems involved in entry within the library catalog were linked with the second major difficulty that of determining the proper sequence of entries in the file the partially classified partially alphabetical arrangement sufficed well enough when catalogs were small but it became increasingly difficult to convey to the library user any meaningful sense of the multiple small and sometimes not so small hierarchies embedded in files that contained literally millions of separate entries the rediscovery of the book for although the paris principles of  overruled the distinction between societies and institutions as far as heading form was concerned american research library personnel backed away from the elimination of entry under place name a heading form which generally applied only to institutions the offending section in the  anglo american cataloging rules later abandoned by the library of congress was entitled exceptions for entry under place with the explanation provided in n   p   this alternative was recognized in the provision of an optional rule b in the  angloamerican cataloging rules north american text  during the s there were a number of attempts to reduce backlogged cataloging by moving to a finding list approach for a typical solution see 
theory of bibliographic control  mat for the catalog somewhat alleviated the difficulties by providing once again the opportunity for scanning  opening library stacks in the research setting a distinct break with anglo european traditions permitted the confused library user some recourse to the materials themselves if the catalog failed still the basic problems were not solved by these stratagems nor were they eliminated by dividing the catalog or committing it to a computer indeed those who tried to design computer filing rules claimed either that the process was too costly or too complex to be worth the effort or that it could be accomplished only by rewriting catalog entries to conform to machine requirements those who protested that humans should not be forced to conform to the limited intelligence of the computer were unable fully to discount the response that the behavior of the machine often reflected the same confusion exhibited by the human user of a large file perhaps then the problem lay in lack of consistency and predictability in file arrangement not in the intelligence of either humans or computers   the third major difficulty besetting library catalogs was the unevenness of descriptive and subject detail incorporated in them early entries tended to be much more elaborate access points more numerous and depth of analysis greater later in response to the pressure of too many materials and too few catalogers there were dramatic cutbacks in descriptive elaboration number of entries and amount of analytic work the single cumulated catalog provided no opportunity for distinguishing these levels of detail and once again the library user still operating in essentially a self service mode was presented with unexplainable inconsistencies all speculations about current practice became dangerous unless the total history of the file was perceived for example one library had in its earlier more relaxed era inserted directional cards to alert users to the availability of manuscript materials dealing with certain persons and organizations when the manuscript cataloging load became too great to continue this helpful practice it was argued that the earlier cards should remain in the catalog where it was maintained they could certainly do no one any harm the catch was that a user seeing the older cards for some names could reasonably reach the conclusion that all manuscript materials were so identified and thus if no card appeared for a person or group in which the user was interested decide that the library had no relevant manuscripts a knowledge of the history of the catalog would have eliminated this confusion few users however can be expected to acquire such knowledge a fourth problem somewhat more elusive than the others emerged out of  a perceptive analysis of the posible effect of changing to the  anglo american cataloging rules is provided by   this problem was confronted in the midst of disertation research only a fortuitous conversation with the chief of the manuscripts department prevented a failure to discover some important letters written by the man upon whom the disertation was centered
 doralyn j hickey the massiveness and unresponsiveness of many library catalogs two signs of illness arose noticeable accumulations of errors and failure to adjust to contemporary terminology although management schemes were devised to spot check filing accuracy and reduce typing errors the combination of human inaccuracy and organizational changes over the years tended to increase the technical unreliability of the catalog this situation was graphically illustrated as attempts to convert manual files to machine readable form often bogged down because of uncorrected errors in the manual catalog in the area of subject analysis the problem was one not so much of errors as of ignorance or bias old terminology sometimes not even correct at the time of its choice for catalog use could not be eliminated without costly revision of the file further the theory of subject cataloging such as it was was based as much upon the convenience of the user as it was upon the good judgment of the cataloger objectionable headings could be easily justified in most cases by literary warrant user expectations and convention but it is likely that the materials could have been just as adequately retrieved through the use of less emotional terms  in sum then catalogers seemed unable to make up their minds as to whether the library catalog was a finding list or a bibliographic tool whether it should cumulate indefinitely or be periodically terminated so that it could be purged of outdated forms whether it should be arranged alphabetically or broken into a number of more manageable but fragmentary parts bibliographies in comparison with the multiplicity of bibliographic structures developing in the united states during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries american library cataloging provides a model of consistency and standardization in general bibliographic efforts in the united states seem to have been more haphazard and reactive than active true there were the great nineteenthcentury bibliographic inventors such as evans sabin jewett and poole and there was the grand dream of the american catalogue but many of these efforts had only limited success at best this analysis can do little more than identify major factors associated with the compilation of bibliographies one was the freedom of the american marketplace which encouraged the development of all types and sizes of bibliographic effort in one sense individuals were their own bibliographers the activities survived as long as there were funds to underwrite the work and a market for the product  unfortunately the literature does not always record the experiences which many library administrators have faced in trying to convert error ridden manual files to machine readable form most of this type of information is transmitted through conversations at library meetings hints of the dimensions of the problem can however be found in the various automation case studies for example 
theory of bibliographic control  frequency arrangement and entry style of the various bibliographies can be categorized only in the most general of terms some appeared on a weekly basis others only at fiveor ten year intervals some were arranged in dictionary order others introduced a highly structured classification system a few exhibited some concern for fullness of entry and regularization of syndetics many more seemed to select names almost ad hoc with no effort to link variant forms subject terminology might be invented by the bibliographer adapted from someone else work or selected from one of the steadily increasing number of standard lists only when cumulations were under way did the need for consistency of entry and headings emerge as vital but not all bibliographies were cumulated many bibliographic activities went unrewarded so that when the bibliographer attention turned to other interests the bibliography could appear late or not at all perhaps the most recognizable factor in the development of published bibliographies was the bifurcation of bibliographic efforts into those directed toward the production of a national bibliography and those centering about the materials of a particular subject field or discipline it would be futile to try to delineate the multiplicity of bibliographic approaches to the various subject fields except to note that the compilers have been less inclined to observe the distinction between book and periodical materials than have library catalogers at the level of national bibliography there are many lessons to be learned from earlier bibliographic work the united states seems to have tried almost every approach imprint lists catalogs of americana trade bibliographies and union catalogs of library holdings the bibliographies seldom purported to include all of the materials published in the united states much less those published by americans elsewhere or those written about the united states and published abroad lists emerged of copyright deposits divided into sections according to the type of material of works in english published in the united states canada or britain of government publications of periodical and serial publications and of works acquired for american library collections more recently there have appeared extensive indexes of periodical articles lists of films and filmstrips catalogs of disc and tape recordings and bibliographies of manuscript collections and microforms during the s and s an international consciousness of the need for  probably the most dramatic presentation of the varieties of the american bibliographic tem occurs in   this three part scope of a national bibliography is traditionally accepted as valid although various other features may be included for a discussion of this question see  esp sew  j  the fragmentation of american national bibliography has been noted by many scholars for a useful summary of the relation between copyright depcit and national bibliography see 
 doralyn j hickey and value of national bibliographies has become more evident a movement called universal bibliographic control a somewhat grandiose but appealing scheme for encouraging the creation or development of national bibliographic structures has focused the attention of a number of americans upon the fragmentation of bibliography in the united states although there may be hope for improvement through the coordinating efforts of such groups as the national commission on libraries and information science the governmental structure and political system of the united states militate against any coerced bibliographic production thus neither the library tradition nor the bibliographic heritage seems able to direct uninterrupted attention toward the creation of a thoroughgoing national bibliography most of the necessary parts are already in existence but the sheer energy required to blend them cooperatively into a national system seems still to be lacking the problems which face bibliographic efforts in the united states are in sum largely associated with the generally laissez faire approach to the control of knowledge and materials characteristic of the american way of life sponsorship of effort is divided between public and private agencies time lags and incomplete coverage of the available literature are the rule rather than the exception formats arrangements and entry style and fullness all follow the inclinations and experiences of individual bibliographers few of the services are directly responsive to user reaction though some attempt to assess their value through consumer surveys and analysis of profitloss statements associated with the sale of a particular service merging the dual systems the varying patterns in bibliographic organization and control in the united states have not contributed significantly to the development of more effective library catalogs although there was a time when librarians might have looked to the national bibliography as the model for local cataloging the transfer of responsibility from the trade publishers to the library of congress after the american library association proved unable to handle the task assured that american national bibliography would be based either upon the work of the copyright office or upon the procedures of lc own cataloging units it is interesting to trace the history of the national bibliographic effort for it shows unmistakably that the speedy creation of cataloging records has regularly taken priority over the development of a comprehensive bibliographic structure perhaps if the library of congress had not become a na intermittent attention has been paid to the problem of the lack of a true american national bibliography at the international level however the desirability of national planning for an integrated bibliographic structure has been recognized by a number of organizations notably the international federation of library associations the international federation for documentation and unesco for an indication of the complexity of the problem see

theory of bibliographic control  new one which places the responsibility for bibliographic efforts squarely upon library personnel if this new theory is to be properly served then it is quite appropriate to de emphasize the pseudo bibliographic devices so often incorporated in the local library catalog diverting this effort to the production of more effective national devices for the identification and exploitation of resources which are currently unexplored or underexplored librarians must lose their monograph fixation so that they can accept full responsibility for revealing the rich contents for example of archival and manuscript collections maps periodicals audiovisual media and machine readable data bases what skills and knowledge should be expected of the user of bibliographic systems currently the theory of bibliographic control presupposes that users of library materials can exploit the collections effectively if the users possess two characteristics an ability to read and a stubborn persistence in the face of difficulty each of these characteristics is in its own way ineffective for an ability to read does not insure an understanding of complex and often inconsistent catalogs nor does persistence always eventuate in success in finding desired resources the library user cannot regularly be typified as the renaissance scholar or even as a dedicated student the user comes in all sizes shapes colors and levels of maturity further even though the user may be quite secure in one field of learning that same person may lack maturity in another area of investigation users arrive with hearsay information erroneous citations carefully copied from seemingly reliable publications or half remembered data gleaned from some brief encounter with an item in the dim past they want to get ahead in their jobs win a lottery settle a bet encounter a new idea or be entertained in most cases however they do not wish to become mired in the techniques of finding the materials they simply want to get to them as quickly and painlessly as possible contemporary students of theories of bibliographic control ought then to take seriously the wide varieties of uses which their clientele have in mind for a library collections deal effectively with these needs by developing bibliographies to match the projected uses and furnish all the guidance and expertise necessary to make the bibliographic system work this type of approach may however be viewed as an attempt to restrict freedom of access to information in one sense perhaps that judgment is valid but it need not be so what is needed is not the identification of a single least common denominator of library users but a psychologically and sociologically sophisticated analysis of user requirements which can provide a greater freedom of choice than is now possible materials may be hidden in two ways by removing them from the catalog or by burying them among hundreds or thousands of similar items in the catalog neither option maximizes the freedom of the user to choose relevant sources
 doralyn j hickey what kinds of access points and arrangements will facilitate catalog use the anglo european tradition has emphasized the author as the starting point for bibliographic control if an author cannot be identified as the prime entry point then an author substitute must be selected as varieties of media have proliferated the inadequacy of holding the theory that all materials should be entered under an author has become apparent further technological advances have obviated the need for single dimensional catalogs in which the official entry offers the only secure access point a contemporary bibliographic theory should be able to dispose quickly of irrelevant arguments about main entry and should concentrate instead upon discovering the types of entry needed to make the material most accessible categorization of entries into author title and subject fails to deal with the question of other types of approaches which may be helpful as either primary or secondary characteristics of selection in machine based systems provision can be made for retrieving by language date geographic origin publisher and salient features of a work such as its format bibliographic theory should concentrate upon devising a way to anticipate the most common form of inquiry by users and establish effective systems to supply appropriate answers the format and arrangement of bibliographic control devices should be equally user oriented a reasonable approach here would be to offer choices of format and arrangement tailored as nearly as possible to fit the needs of the projected user this requires a sophisticated understanding of the user expectations what depth of bibliographic control should be provided for more than a century librarians have insisted upon dealing primarily with the description of physical objects books a run of periodical volumes a record album a film as the basis of the cataloging despite their provision of analytics few catalogers were eager to attempt to assess the quality of library materials though this analysis presumably could legitimately take place before the materials were added to the collection this reluctance to judge materials by means of the cataloging process has unfortunately resulted in placing sometimes literally hundreds of bibliographic records under a single name or subject term the user must then forge through the file item by item to select potentially appropriate sources why is it that librarians steadfastly refuse to provide qualitative judgments about the potential strengths and weaknesses of certain materials for particular types of uses a recent conference involving catalog librarians addressed the question of how to break up unreasonably long files which have developed under certain general subject headings in card catalogs although the utility of such files was recognized as minimal there was an almost unanimous rejection of the application of value judgments to the arrangement of the entries they could be sequenced by publication date though it was admitted that the worth of
theory of bibliographic control  the material was not always determined by its age and perhaps by language but not by the material level of treatment of the topic and not by recognized characteristics of bias in the items described is it not possible for catalogers to help users select appropriate materials without running the danger of infringing upon their intellectual freedom one question concerning depth of bibliographic analysis has not yet been addressed is there need for a single comprehensive bibliographic listing of everything ever written or published or released dealing with a given topic certainly one aspect of bibliographic control of library materials has been the effort to collocate references to all information which the library has on a subject yet it has been demonstrated repeatedly that the effort is futile especially since library catalogs do not normally index periodical literature with machine techniques however it is at least technically possible to create a comprehensive bibliographical listing of references to a given topic this in turn raises a further question does anyone want such a list to this question there is no firm answer but there is clearly some doubt as to whether those who ask for a comprehensive list actually want one bibliographic theory needs to deal directly with this question with the object of either laying it to rest or rephrasing it in a much more sophisticated manner how long should a bibliographic record cumulate american bibliographers have long recognized that indefinite cumulation of any list eventually occasions severe problems possibly the weakest aspect of current theories of bibliographic control is their failure to deal systematically with the problems of subdividing the record so that necessary structural adjustments can be made without destroying the credibility of the service if librarians have been derelict in any area of cataloging it is in their unwillingness to face the fact that files cannot be permitted to grow indefinitely although superimposition of unlike entries and bibliographic descriptions is physically possible its toll upon the library user may be high one of the unfortunate facts of library life is the user tendency to walk away from a catalog when it appears not to have performed well no complaints no objections just an acceptance of defeat in view of the user common reluctance to verbalize bibliographic problems coupled with the librarian expectations that the catalog is a self service tool the responsibility falls to the designers of bibliographic systems to analyze and prescribe a cure for the difficulties created by accretion in the catalog surely there are more innovative solutions than merely closing the file every century or so prolegomena to a theory of bibliographic control at this juncture in american library history quite appropriately at the end of american librarians first  years of self conscious professionalism it
 doralyn j hickey must be concluded that although theories of bibliographic control have abounded in this country these theories have sometimes reflected outmoded traditions inadequate understanding of user needs and narrow perceptions of economic constraints rather than end this analysis on such a negative note however it may be useful to highlight some of the fragments of a coherent theory of bibliographic control which seem to be emerging  systems for bibliographic control are best designed and carried out in the library context but they must represent the cooperative effort of librarians in order to cover all of the materials available to the user  in a pluralistic society dedicated to the preservation of individual liberty as well as civil obedience bibliographic systems must also be pluralistic that is they must be designed to provide a wide range of information without predicating anything more than a desire on the part of the user to have that information the system should be capable of being understood in its general structure but it need not be a self service operation from the user standpoint  the concept of main entry and author entry versus secondary entries should give way to a sophisticated analysis of desirable access points to the bibliographic record common inquiry patterns of users should be investigated in order to design systems which will respond to those inquiries effectively  the depth of analysis represented in the bibliographic record should be such that the user may enter the system at a level appropriate to the requirements of the inquiry artificial divisions of the bibliographic record solely on the basis of the physical format of the material should give way to an articulated sequence of bibliographic aids differentiated on the basis of the user intensity of interest in the topic evaluative judgments about the potential utility of the material for various purposes should become a part of the bibliographic apparatus but these judgments should not be used to prevent access to the material itself  interruptions in the bibliographic record should be introduced in order to permit structural adjustments in the system as warranted by changes in american society and in world situations artificial breaks associated merely with the desire to clear the record of debris should be eliminated in favor of planned breaks which can be interpreted readily to the user postscript this analysis of the theory of bibliographic control has avoided any discussion of international patterns of bibliography and cataloging such an omission was deliberate to attempt to construct bibliographic patterns in the united states simply as a means of facilitating international exchange of data is futile a case in point is the repeated failure of americans to develop a respectable comprehensive national bibliography all the necessary elements for the creation of the national bibliography are currently available ameri
