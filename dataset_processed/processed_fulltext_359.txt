public library service in the middle west g flint purdy tibrarians have long recognized the prevalence of extreme inequality in library service among different areas they have deplored a condition in which fortyfive million americans are without access to any sort of local public library while other millions are but meagerly served they are firmly convinced that greater equality in access to books is an end worthy of strenuous individual and collective effort they believe that this end may be more conveniently and economically furthered through the medium of the public library than by any other apparent means it is not the purpose of the present analysis to examine the validity of the convictions thus stated although some evidence which bears upon their reasonableness will be presented nor is it assumed that the convictions are necessarily correct the investigation upon which the present article is based represents an objective analysis of variations in public library facilities support and use among  counties of seven middle western states its purposes are i to describe variations in public library resources and service among the  counties  to ascertain some of the causes of the variations thus described and to measure their relative and combined importance  to measure the degree to which public library development is spatially associated with the distribution of reading materials from other sources  to measure the association between library development and the distribution of radios telephones automobiles and the status of secondary education and  to interpret in terms of their social and library implications the facts thus described it is hoped that the considerations dei part of unpublished doctor thesis graduate library school university of chicago

 the librdry tudrterly public libraries in the seven middle western states were summarized by county second the library data were converted into per capita or percentage figures using the entire population of each couinty as the base thus i and  were expressed as per cents of the total population while the other three factors were stated in per capita terms third the status of each county with respect to each of the five factors representing library resources and service was expressed as an index number in the form of the percentage which the given figure for the county was of the corresponding figure for the seven states considered as a unit thus the per capita public library expenditure of each county was divided by and expressed as a percentage of the per capita public library expenditure of the region as a whole fourth the five index numbers were combined in various ways in an attempt to secure a useful composite index of library service that finally accepted as reasonably satisfactory is a composite of four of the factors enumerated above per cent of population served being omitted fifth a study was made of the spatial association between public library development as measured by the county compilation of library data and the distribution of general magazines farm journals daily newspapers weekly newspapers radio receiving sets residence telephones passenger automobiles school enrolment urbanization and wealth for this purpose a sample of i counties was used  selected at random from each state this sample will be subsequently referred to as the general sample the relative status of the various counties with respect to library development was compared with their status according to each of the other variables by means of conventional techniques of statistical correlation sixth two samples of ioo counties each were selected for further study one consisted of counties in which more than so per cent of the residents resided in incorporated places of  population or more in  this group will be referred to  see p  for more complete explanation of the indices

public library service in the middle west  the relative importance of wealth and urbanization as causes of variation in library development there can be little doubt that urbanization is a potent factor particularly when its total influence direct and indirect is considered the statistical analysis has suggested however that rural areas lack library service not primarily because of difficulties involved in establishing contacts between books and rural readers but because the rural areas generally lack economic resources for the support of libraries other studies have shown that farm incomes average considerably lower than those of city dwellers thus leaving a rn index  roe  index i index    index  or over  ic fig economic status of each county in seven middle western states according to an index of economic ability

public library service in the middle west  twice as many library books are loaned in counties which have bookstores as in counties without them the facts summarized above furnish evidence that the provision of the facilities for education and recreation which were considered tend to follow the same pattern a county of low library status is usually also relatively lacking in general reading materials radios and telephones and has a comparatively small proportion of its residents in the   year age group enrolled in school these facts suggestthat public library service is at least no less desirable in the areas now ranking low in library development than in those which rank high if the equalization of opportunity to read is socially desirable in cleveland it seems reasonable to assume that it is equally desirable in johnson county illinois this assumption however necessitates two previous premises namely i that the equalization of reading opportunity is a legitimate social function and  that the public library is the most effective and economical means of achieving that end obviously the evidence examined in this study neither proves nor disproves these premises the librarian by the very nature of his position accepts them as valid a broad social consideration of the question however would necessitate an attempt to view the place and cost of public library service in perspective much study is needed before the librarian can avoid basing his philosophy upon unproved assumptions the present study contributes toward an ultimate solution i evidence that other agencies of recreation and education do not in general supplement public library service among the counties of the middle west and  suggestions as to causal factors which must be considered in any plan proposing to render public library service more equitable the analysis of the relationships of selected quantitative factors to public library service confirms the importance of urbanization as a conditioner of cultural development including the development of public libraries it suggests however that urbanization is more important as a cause of variation in wealth than as a direct cause of inequality in library service the interrelations among the data examined suggest wealth
 the library quarterly as the most important condition of community access to public library service it is thus pertinent to ask how well the factor of wealth represents the total group of conditions both measurable and unmeasurable which may be expected to encourage communities to establish and support libraries the data analyzed in the foregoing pages suggest that wealth is not only one of the most tangible and measurable of the conditions examined but a factor of major importance in itself the values with which the american community at least in the middle west is most concerned are largely associated with financial prosperity wealth is regarded not merely as a token of vocational success but as combining important benefits in social prestige security and opportunities for wider horizons cultivation of the arts and the like the services offered by the public library represent the latter type of use of money the enrichment of personal and community life wealth is almost invariably first cultivation after although experience has shown that the principle is not immutable its application to services which society deems essential to the common good has been greatly modified formal education being regarded as a matter of social concern is subsidized by county state and federal governments thus in effect wealth is confiscated from areas of greater economic ability for the support of schools in poorer communities the same principle applied to the protection of health the construction of highways etc has materially modified spatial inequalities in such facilities the growth of public library service under a traditional system of local autonomy has resulted in the wide disparity exemplified by the distribution of library facilities among the counties of the middle west this study has suggested the probability that any plan of equalization must aim at control of the principal causal factor which can be in some measure controlled namely inequality in wealth the possibility of predicting library development from the economic index alone within a relatively small error of estimate and nearly as accurately as from four factors combined suggests the potential
public library service in the middle west i value of economic data as a convenient and tangible basis for distributing subsidies the influence of wealth upon library service emphasizes the importance of adequate areas of support thousands of towns townships and even counties lack the wealth necessary to support effective library service in many areas the unit could be adjusted to permit a workable balance between an adequate basis of support and a practicable area of service in others no adjustment of local units can provide adequate support while wealth appears in general to be the most important direct condition of library development it accounts for only a little more than half of the variation among the  counties in library service there is need for studies of the influence of other factors particularly of nonquantitative factors under specific conditions undoubtedly economic resources have been relatively unimportant in some counties while historical and personal factors have played a vital part in many in some communities topography is a primary consideration in others local government or politics legislation plays an important role particularly in some states units of service are of vital importance in many areas witness the influence of the town organization in new england and of the adoption of the county unit for library service in california and new jersey the availability of reading materials from other sources affects the need for public library service in specific localities clubs churches traditions conventions and leadership all have been and will continue to be influential in determining the degree of library service maintained in given communities careful scrutiny of the action and interaction of these influences could hardly fail to yield much information of practical value to planners of future library development problems suggested for further investigation numerous questions some of which are amenable to fruitful investigation have been raised in the course of the study here summarized among those most closely related to this study the following are perhaps worthy of enumeration
 the library quarterly i the application of techniques of statistical correlation analysis to the local units of other relatively homogeneous regions is suggested probably no region is quite as well suited to county analysis as is the middle west no other equally homogeneous area combines reasonably complete quantitative records a sufficient number of counties and a minimum of counties entirely without public library service for this reason the use of other units particularly of library districts and municipalities offers promise of more fruitful study in other regions similar analyses of samples random and selected of counties library districts and cities from the country as a whole should yield valuable information a similar study of counties served by county libraries would be useful in defining the factors associated with varying degrees of county library service and should yield highly important information on minimal population economic and other requirements of satisfactory county library service  careful and detailed historical studies planned to define and evaluate the historical factors which have significantly influenced the development of library service in the country as a whole and in various states and regions are needed  intensive case studies of selected communities combining the historical approach with statistical and other techniques in an attempt to define factors of causation are suggested  fundamental to an ultimate library philosophy which places public library service in its proper social relationships are studies of the status of reading as a social means of transmitting ideas of providing recreation and of promoting social stability in the same category fall studies of the relative cost and effectiveness of supplying society with reading materials from different sources and by means of different agencies there is definite need of more extensive and intensive study of the accessibility of reading materials in various areas and under different sets of conditions such studies may well approach the question from the point of view of the various sources and also from that of the reader intensive analyses of relatively limited areas combining the two points of view appear to offer particular promise
