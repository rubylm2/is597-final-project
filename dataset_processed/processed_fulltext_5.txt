 journal of education for library and information science of increasingly diverse user communities these efforts normally fall under the broad discourse of diversity and multiculturalism although these two terms indirectly relate to this study the focus of this inquiry is preparing culturally competent lis professionals through lis education cultural competence is typically seen as a sub genre of scholarship on diversity and multicultural issues as such the literature review in the following section begins by exploring diversity and multicultural discourses within lis the subsequent section examines the more specific literature on cultural competence in lis diversity and multicultural scholarship in lis the demographic composition of the us population is changing rapidly and as a result there has been a steady stream of diversity and multicultural scholarship and outreach initiatives launched in the lis field and beyond balderrama  in the broad context of lis the focus of these initiatives centers on better preparing workers to serve in culturally diverse library communities in the specific context of lis schools there is a burgeoning body of work that touts the value and importance of integrating diversity and multicultural issues into the lis curriculum see eg abdullahi  henninger  hurlbert  kim  sin  this body of work reflects a basic understanding that having a more balanced representation of students from diverse cultural backgrounds will increase the likelihood that future librarians will provide services that reflect deeper cultural linguistic and racial understanding gorman  winston  walstad  demographically speaking there is a cultural mismatch between the lis student body and professional workforce and the wider us population the majority of lis students and professionals are middle aged white english speaking females meanwhile the nation communities have become increasingly non white and multilingual lance s as a result a default goal for many diversity initiatives in lis educational scholarship is to help the majority white lis student and professional communities to build cultural sensibilities and to develop strategies for serving minority communities overall  ironically whiteness as a racial and cultural signifier with its own privileged assumptions worldviews and lived experiences rarely enters into diversity discourses in education haviland  it would seem that the study of whiteness would be an integral facet of diversity scholarship in lis given the racial demographics of the workforce however discussions of whiteness and institutional racism are virtually absent in lis literature to help understand why this is so honma  interrogates the epistemological foundations of lis and articulates two significant issues which he describes as unacknowledged whiteness and the superficiality of celebratory multiculturalism p  in the first case honma draws reference to the public library role in the americanization project and its complicity in assimilating a variety of ethnic groups into citizenship the irony about this moment in library history is that this americanization project did not extend to people of color who could not reasonably be considered white in spite of this proactive role in the shaping of a white citizenry p  the field of lis according to honma has refused to keep up with ongoing discussions of race choosing instead to substitute the less controversial discourses of diversity and multiculturalism which inadequately represent the racial discrepancies within the field p  this call for the acknowledgment of whiteness and the normativity it implies is echoed by pawley  in her exposition on race and multiculturalism in the lis curriculum she contends that the use of the term multiculturalism in lis facilitated a systematic avoidance of the r word which remains not only understudied but
are we there yet   also poorly understood p   pawley further states few lis classes include race in their titles and while some researchers  especially library historians  have indeed put race and ethnicity at the center of their research agendas they are generally small in number a search for race in the titles indexed in the online database library literature and information science confirms the suspicion that the lis community avoids overt discussion of race while embracing multiculturalism and diversity p  in order to avoid the kind of benign pluralistic approach to diversity that honma  and pawley  warn against it is essential to articulate the conceptual underpinnings and goals of various diversity research initiatives to that end jaeger and franklin  presentation of the virtuous circle provided a conceptual framework that illustrated the positive effect increased faculty and student diversity would likely have on creating more inclusive library services additionally overall  provides a conceptual overview of what cultural competence entails in the context of lis research and practice the next section looks more closely at overall work which informed the design of the survey instrument used in this study cultural competence and lis scholarship overall has produced the most recent and in depth scholarship on cultural competence in the context of lis overall  describes cultural competence in relation to lis as the ability to recognize the significance of culture in one own life and in the lives of others and to come to know and respect diverse cultural backgrounds and characteristics through interaction with individuals from diverse linguistic cultural and socioeconomic groups and to fully integrate the culture of diverse groups into services work and institutions in order to enhance the lives of both those being served by the library profession and those engaged in service p  in the article competence is defined as abilities rather than behaviors developed over time which demonstrate a high degree of knowledge and understanding overall offers a three part framework for understanding cultural competence which include self awareness education and interaction self awareness has to do with recognizing the significance of culture in one own life and in the lives of others education has to do with fully integrating the culture of diverse groups into services work and institutions in order to enhance the lives of both those being served by the library profession and those engaged in service finally interaction deals with knowing and respecting diverse cultural backgrounds and characteristics through interaction with individuals from diverse linguistic cultural and socioeconomic groups the author points to low library usage across historically underrepresented communities as one of the core reasons for needing cultural competence among lis professionals however she goes beyond citing low usage statistics and begins to critique the way knowledge itself if constructed in the lis field as problematic for some minority communities the author argues that because the lis field is grounded in objectivist notions of knowledge and behaviorist notions of learning that it can inadvertently overlook or marginalize the epistemologies embodied in some minority communities this critique has also been levied by other lis scholars who have argued that information literacy  which is the heart of library and information curricula  is rooted in a positivist view of learning that divorces information problems from their social and political context kapitzke  furthermore kumasi johnson
 journal of education for library and information science  used the context of in school library instruction to illustrate the problems with mainstream approaches to information literacy instruction in the school library context stating that a student may identify a seemingly mundane noncritical information problem such as ow to build a garden and never be challenged to investigate important social issues such as who can build a garden and who cannot p  in general lis literature has made significant strides towards including marginalized perspectives on diversity and to articulate what it means to be culturally competent the time is ripe to expand the conversation even further and to conduct empirical studies that capture various elements of culturally sensitive library service and teaching practices this study is one small effort toward this end and will potentially help bridge the divide between theory and practice that often stagnates diversity discourses in lis methods instrumentation the researchers developed a web based survey instrument that was designed to collect information about the extent to which lis students felt that their programs have prepared them to effectively serve library patrons from a variety of cultural backgrounds prior to distributing the survey the researchers pre tested the survey on students and colleagues at their universities the questionnaires were approved by the institutional review boards at both universities and contained informed consent and language that allowed participants to end their survey participation the survey instrument itself was modeled after libqual which is an instrument designed to measure library service qualify libqual h itself was modeled after servqual a pioneer instrument used frequently in the private sector to measure customer satisfaction crossno et al  whereas the libqual survey asks users to reflect on the quality of library service this study asks students to reflect on the levels of education they receive in terms of cultural competence preparation although other studies have implemented cultural competence instruments to evaluate students cultural knowledge and abilities these studies did not measure the kinds of learning outcomes and abilities that correlate to lis practice see eg brathwaite  majumdar  what attracted us to the design of the libqual instrument was its ability to utilize the gap analysis technique to interpret the results a gap analysis involves using surveys to help detect discrepancies between customer expectations of an organization and that organizations ability to deliver on those expectations eldridge  at its core are two questions where are we and where do we want to be in the context of libraries the gap analysis has been used to help libraries answer the questions what are the service qualify issues identified by our users as most important and which of these services are in need of most attention cook heath  thompson  similarly the gap analysis technique can be translated into the context of lis education to help answer the questions what aspects of cultural competence do students identify as being most important to learn in their lis coursework and to what extent do students feel that the important concepts to learn are being taught we found the gap measurement model to be intuitively appealing because the scores on a given item are interpreted using different ratings of the same item for example in the  item libqual h participants respond to the  service criteria by rating each criterion with regard to  the minimum level of service that is deemed acceptable  the perceived level of service seen as being offered  the desired level of service thompson cook  heath  p

 journal of education for library and information science edge gaps for the education section of the questionnaire this section of the survey includes eight items that contain statements which students rated according to their prior knowledge the importance of learning the concept presented and the knowledge they gained about the concept through their courses the knowledge gaps in the area of education had a range of variance in examining the knowledge gaps for education students rated their prior knowledge of the concepts in the education section between low a score of  to moderate a score of  on the likert scale these relatively low to average self ratings are understandable when one considers that the respondents were all matriculating in lis programs in which they presumably enrolled in order to become introduced to or better educated about library issues to further explain the knowledge gaps in this section it is helpful to group the scores and examine them by the statements in each item no or low knowledge gain the one item that resulted in the majority of respondents rating their prior knowledge as superior to what they were taught was item  this item instructed participants to reflect on their knowledge of the cultural differences among ethnic populations in the us even though the majority of students n   rated their prior knowledge as moderate a score of  they rated what they learned in their courses as slightly less than moderate a score of  resulting in a gap score of  in this instance students did not have exposure to this particular concept to the extent that it increased their knowledge level the items with statements for which the majority of respondents indicated that they had the same amount of knowledge before and after entering an lis program were items   and  respectively  understanding of the term iteracy including cognitive and socio cultural perspectives  recognition of barriers to information access and use that may exist for individuals from various cultures and  recognition of the role libraries play in providing outreach and specialized services to various cultural groups in the us in all three items the majority of students n    and  respectively rated themselves as having a moderate level of prior knowledge a score of  and also determined that they had exactly the same level of knowledge following the coursework they had completed at the time they participated in the survey resulting in a knowledge gap score of  knowledge increase two items  and  called for respondents to consider their level of knowledge about  collection development strategies that reflect the information wants and needs of individuals from various cultures and  considering the impact that recruiting library professionals from various cultural backgrounds has on library service for these items respondents n   and  most frequently rated their prior knowledge level as low a score of   and the knowledge they gained as just above moderate a score of  items  and  which asked respondents to rate their  familiarity with the history of library service to individuals from various cultures  recognition of how individuals from various cultures access information students most frequently rated their prior knowledge level for item  as low a score of   and the knowledge they gained as moderate a score of  resulting in gap

 journal of education for library and information science there is a need to better infuse cultural competence learning objectives into the lis curriculum while students reported experiencing some minimal increases in their knowledge about various areas of cultural competence this study clearly showed faculty and students would benefit from having a more deliberate and streamlined set of cultural competence curriculum standards so that student learning outcomes can improve and be measured more concretely a beginning step toward this end might be for lis faculty and administration to have preliminary conversations about how well they think their programs are currently teaching the cultural competence concepts presented in this study such conversations can lead to the kind of strategic planning and curriculum alignment that would help push cultural competence education beyond rhetoric and into action acknowledgements the authors wish to thank scout calvert delicia greene marcele haddix paul jaeger william walker and dian walster for their assistance and thoughtful critique a special thank also goes to john henrichs and paul beavers for their guidance in helping with the statistical and conceptual aspects of the gap analysis technique that was employed in this study references abdullahi i  diversity and intercultural issues in library and information science lis education new library world  x   balderrama s s r  this trend called diversity library trends     brathwaite ac  majumdar b  evaluation of a cultural competence educational programme journal of advanced nursing    crossno je berkins b gotcher n hill jl mcconoughey m  walters m  assessment of customer service in academic health care libraries acsahl an instrument for measuring customer service bull med libr assoc     cook c heath f  thompson b  the search for new measures the arl libqual project preliminary report libraries and the academy l   eldredge j  inventory of research methods for librarianship and informatics journal of the medical library association    gorman m  what ails library education journal of academic librarianship   haviland v  things get glossed over rearticulating the silencing power of whiteness in education journal of teacher education    henninger e  hurlbert j m  using the seven principles for good practices in undergraduate education a framework for teaching cultural diversity in a management course journal of business  finance librarianship    honma t  trippin over the color line the invisibility of race in library and information studies interactions ucla journal of education and information studies    jaeger p  franklin r  the virtuous circle increasing diversity in library faculties to create more inclusive library services and outreach education libraries      kapitzke c  information literacy a positivist epistemology and a politics of outformation educational theory    kim k  sin s  increasing ethnic diversity in lis strategies suggested by librarians of color library quarterly    lance k c  racial and ethnic diversity of us library workers american libraries    overall pm  the effect of service learning on lis students understanding of diversity issues related to equity of access journal of education for library and information science    overall pm  cultural competence a conceptual framework for library and information science professionals library quarterly    pawley c  unequal legacies race and multiculturalism in the lis curriculum library quarterly    thompson b cook c  heath f  the libqual gap measurement model the bad the ugly and the good of gap measurement performance measurement and metrics    winston m  walstad k  recruitment and diversity a research study of bilingualism and library services library  information science research
