profiles of constituent groups indicators of effectiveness of schools of library and information studies rebecca watson boone and darlene e weingand this article is the first in a series of reports on the indicators and dimensions of effectiveness that constituents of american library association alaaccredited programs of library and information studies lis believe are useful for evaluating the host schools members of the four constituent groups were surveyed senior academic administrators ala committee on accreditation co a employers of alums and alums the distinct nature of each constituent group is profiled by focusing on the preference each gives to the placement of seventy effectiveness indicators in addition brief description is given of twenty four indicators upon which the constituent groups exhibit their greatest agreement slis programs do not exist because they independently decide to do so gatekeepers of various kinds determine the existence of both the schools and their programs when senior academic administrators decide that a school is not essential to the mission of the institution then employer alum and professional association agitation may not be sufficient to reverse the decision further when coa ascertains that a program does not meet accreditation standards the school may suffer enrollment and placement declines  jeopardizing its continuation this may also be the case when employers or prospective students come to believe that a school does not adequately prepare graduates for work or careers or that it no longer interacts effectively with the practitioner field even though one might suspect that academic administrators and employers rely on different criteria or standards to assess the effectiveness of lis schools no empirical research has been carried out on this question the criteria used by academic administrators and coa in initiating and conducting program reviews and in deciding issues of program continuance have not been compared  yet these two groups are major gatekeepers and although employers and alums may differ somewhat on the value of the education received published comment by these groups may not relay all the criteria on which they base their opinions of schools   volume  number

 journal of education for library and information science project objectives the objectives of this  alise supported project have been the following  to identify indicators and dimensions of effectiveness that are descriptive of ala accredited lis programs and that are believed by the schools constituents to be useful in evaluating the schools effectiveness  to ascertain the similarities and differences in the concepts and indicators underlying lis school evaluations across the constituencies   to see if the results suggest avenues for strengthening current schools as well as for viewing the future of schools of library and information studies methodology the childersvan house effectiveness research model  was adapted to serve the objectives of this study the fundamental research question was what are the indicators and dimensions of effectiveness that are descriptive of schools with ala accredited lis programs and that are believed by their constituents to be useful in evaluating the schools effectiveness literature review an extensive review was conducted of the literature focusing on lis schools and programs sources included eric lisa accreditation standards bibliographies research reports and texts a comprehensive list of six hundred descriptive words and phrases was developed based on the same assumption that guided childers and van house that such a comprehensive list derived from prior work should diminish the imposition of criteria by investigators and the reflection of their own definition of effectiveness and preferences for dimensions and indicators from the initial indicators the list was collapsed into progressively smaller more general sets using the constant comparative method the final set consisted of seventy statements these statements were formatted into a four page questionnaire and were arranged alphabetically in order to deter the clustering of related statements questionnaire design the questionnaire was pretested by representatives of the constituent groups the question that served as introduction to the seventy statements was in describing the effectiveness of a school of library  information studies to a person in a position comparable to yours emphasis in original how important would it be for you to know each of the following about that school a five point likert scale was provided ranging from  not important to know to  essential to know a no opinion option was given each participant was asked to rate each of the indicator statements by circling the number that reflects your opinion additional comments were invited participants were instructed that they were not rating a particular slis and they were urged not to delegate their response to others eligible programs the fifty nine ala accredited programs comprised the population programs were then excluded if one or more of the following conditions pertained  the school had been slated to close and the program discontinued volume  number

  journal of education for library and information science indicators related to resources are equally split between the important and the not important categories only one merits high importance ratio of faculty to students low important to know other than the ratio of faculty to students all resource related indicators are found here or in the employers bottom  this constituent group does not concern itself with the availability of scholarship and fellowship funds or the relationship between the school budget and its academic program needs or with how the school manages its currently available resources in line with this employers have little interest in the recruitment or enrollment of students  or in what kinds of students apply regarding faculty this group believes there is little value in knowing about the filling of faculty vacancies and whether faculty are satisfied with the school remaining faculty issues ranked here are demographic in nature  diversity of faculty backgrounds eg ethnicity gender area of specialization degrees  size of the school faculty  extent of interdisciplinarity in faculty teaching and research  use of adjunct faculty guest lecturers three administrative issues are put here with employers evidencing low interest in the ability of the deandirector to represent the school to institutional administrators or in his or her visibilityinvolvement on campus and within the profession information on the school assessment programs is of limited value the extent of interdisciplinarity within the master program and the availability of programs via distance education are of small concern to employers along with both continuing education indicators the availability of ceus and format variety not important to know employers rank more indicators in this category than any other constituent group although physical facilities of the school is given little importance by all four groups only employers place it in their not important category a number of resource indicators are found in the employers bottom   school ability to engage in external fund raising  external funding received by the faculty  salary comparability of deandirector and faculty to counterparts on campus and in other lis schools  number and type of support personnel employers do not want to know about the relationship between the school mission and the mission of its institution nor are they concerned about the organizational location of the school or with faculty involvement in governance two curricular indicators are also in their bottom  the availability of small group activities and the duplication of course content within school or with other academic units on campus the single faculty indicator in this category concerns the involvement of faculty from other departments in thesis committees within the school coa and alums also place this indicator under not important to know finally employers consider two alum and student indicators to be unimportant for assessing a school they give enrollment trends over the past five years a slight edge above the bottom  ranking they give to alums involvement with the school volume  number 
profiles of constituent groups    summary although employers and alums agree on many of the indicators in the important to know category they differ more substantially in the essential and not important categories employers agree with coa that all recruitment issues fall into the important category employers are in close agreement with administrators on the split of faculty issues between essential and important categories of all four constituent groups employers are the most willing to say an indicator is not important in evaluating a school conclusion when asked to identify indicators that are most useful in evaluating the effectiveness of a lis school all four constituent groups place accreditation status faculty awareness of new developments in the field the reputation of the school and how employers view the school graduates among their top  first septile indicators they also focus on the goals and objectives of the school the reputation of its faculty and the direction the school provides to professional practice beyond these each constituent group prefers a slightly different set of indicators coa focuses on administrative and alumemployment issues and secondarily on those related to faculty the curriculum and resources administrators initially emphasize administrative and certain recruitment issues following with ones related to the curriculum faculty students and resources alums believe that curricular issues are as important as administrative ones they consider continuing education students recruitment and faculty concerns to be secondary finally employers place alumemployment and administrative topics first and curricular continuing education recruitment and faculty issues second this article has profiled each constituent group in order to gain a clearer sense of the standards used by each additional analysis will be undertaken to identify the areas of agreement and disagreement between pairs of constituent groups references  marion fans library bcnool closings four case studies metuchen nj scarecrow   maurice p marchant and nathan m smith the research library director view of library education college  research libraries     patricia m battin developing university and research library professionals a director perspective american libraries     william r eshelman the erosion of library education library journal     maurice p marchant and nathan m smith the public library director view of library education paper presented at  alise conference chicago  herbert s white and marion paris employer preferences and the library education curriculum library quarterly      herbert s white perceptions by educators and administrators of the ranking of library school programs college  research libraries     herbert s white perceptions by educators and administrators of the ranking of library school programs an update and analysis library quarterly      herbert s white and sarah l mort the accredited library education program as preparation for professional library work library quarterly     george walter whitbeck the influence of librarians in liberal arts colleges as demonstrated by their role in selected areas of decision making phd diss rutgers university school of library service  m kathy cook rank spring
