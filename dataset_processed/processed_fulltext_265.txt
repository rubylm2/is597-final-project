 the library quarterly and tallahassee and out of these came several important products and at least one significant by product at the second atlanta conference the southern association school library standards were revised and strengthened the nashville conference held at peabody was devoted entirely to the content of the curriculum for the education of the teacher librarian and the school librarian from the beginning the south had been confronted with the problem of articulating short courses in teachertraining institutions with ala accredited programs in library schools unable to secure any assistance on the national level since the other regions maintained steadily that the problem did not exist in any significant proportions for the library schools of the east west and midwest before the war the south decided to attack the problem regionally in nashville representatives of all kinds of library educational agencies sat down together there were teachers of teacher librarians who offered twelve semester hours or less of professional library education there were heads of departments of library science with offerings up to thirty hours in professional courses and there were of course the directors of the south ala accredited library schools the problem was to articulate not only these three types of programs but the individual courses that comprised them in such a way that students moving from one institution to another would not be penalized by repetition a monumental piece of work resulted including syllabi for core courses and standardization of transfers the tallahassee conference introduced the workshop as a technique and launched a series of workshops the following summer in most of the southeastern states for the improvement of school librarianship general education board funds supplemented state and personal budgets and made possible wide participation mimeographed reports of these state workshops describe dramatically the postwar stimulus given to school librarianship by these state workshops and regional conferences the by product was a fifth regional conference in atlanta sponsored by the southeastern library association and financed by the general education board this time college and university public and special librarians as well as school librarians and library school teachers were brought together to explore the common aspects of education for librarianship in all kinds of libraries this atlanta conference was unique in the history of professional library gatherings it helped school librarians and university librarians to cite the two kinds of librarians who most often contend they have professionally comparatively little in common discover that there is a unity in librarianship after a week of exploration it became evident that there is a core of professional content and method necessary for the adequate performance of librarianship in any type of library interstate movements the second significant influence on regional library thinking and planning in the southeast are the strong interstate  summary of third southern library planning conference on training for school librarianship november    nashville tennessee peabody college southern association quarterly xi march    library leadership work conference march    tallahassee florida state university library journal lxxii february     nora beust and w h shaw report of library workshops for the general education board november   typescript  southeastern conference on library education february  march   atlanta georgia southeastern library association 
library co operation in the southeast  movements in many areas of human endeavor in agriculture and industry in labor and interracial relations in numerous economic and cultural efforts planning and working have cut across state boundaries more frequently in the southeast than perhaps in any other region in the united states inevitably these interstate inclinations have manifested themselves in education and in libraries among the most powerful of the interstate influences is that exerted by the regional accrediting agency the southern association of colleges and secondary schools which includes two states in the southwestern as well as the nine in the southeastern library association through its library standards for schools and its library education standards for colleges and universities it has had a powerful effect on strengthening the regional library association as early as  therefore the southeastern library association was in a position to recommend personnel and principles for evaluating and standardizing libraries and library education through the southern association commission on higher education the southeastern library association was able to exert its professional influence in developing standardized lists of periodicals and reference books for college and university libraries other interstate educational associations and agencies like those of the graduate schools and of various subject areas such as modern languages offer an opportunity for and an incentive to a regional library association to assume leadership and speak up for professional librarianship in the southeast but of all the interstate educational agencies in the southeast none has had greater impact or more dramatic appeal than the southern regional education board it was created by the action of thirteen state legislatures in the south in june  to promote regional educational development this action marked the first time in the history of the united states that states had entered into a compact for inter state cooperation in education the mission of the board is well summarized in these words the full development of leadership cannot be done by each state as a self contained unit industry agriculture and public services are no respecters of state lines flood control interterritorial freight rates soil erosion crop regions forest areas marketing regions housing problems health deficiencies are a few of the problems held in common by many or all states in the south no single state nor institution can develop within its own borders the technical facilities for leadership training in all fields of human knowledge under these circumstances the board representing all the states has undertaken to plan with the universities areas of specialization and concentration to date three major fields have been developed human medicine dentistry and veterinary medicine additional fields are under consideration under the terms of the compact states without training facilities in these areas pay at the rate of  per year for each medical and dental student and  for each veterinary medicine student toward the support of institutions in other states these examples are sufficient to indicate the trend of regional planning in the south for higher education this kind of regional educational planning inevitably has some immensely important implications for libraries but in order for libraries to avail themselves of  additional states have entered the agreement or are about to enter  john e ivey jr some recent developments in regional education southeastern librarian i fall   n ibid
 the library quarterly these opportunities they cannot plan and function on an isolated individual basis while the institutions they serve move ever closer to a regional plan it is obvious that libraries too must plan regionally if for no other reason than that regional educational voices may speak with regional library voices federal agencies the third potent interstate influence emanates from the increasing number of federal agencies that have chosen the southeast for their activities first and foremost among these has been the tennessee valley authority the tva region which first included only the states in the tennessee valley has so extended its good work and services that all the nine southeastern states willingly entered the regional library survey which it sponsored but the tva interest did not end with this vast stock taking of the library opportunities in the southeast shortly after it offered the southeastern library association generous support for the dissemination through libraries of information about the region although economies in the federal budget prevented the consummation of this provocative regional undertaking at least one co operative project was completed and the southeastern library association was further stimulated to strengthen its organization for additional undertakings nor is the tva the only federal agency that has found its way into the southeast since world war  an increasing number of military and related governmental agencies have chosen the southeast for headquarters and in their wake has followed considerable private industry among the most important of these agencies are the air university the naval research laboratory the institute of nuclear research and the air proving ground since the work of these institutions is being related to the graduate and professional programs of the universities of the region library responsibility can be assumed only on a regional basis and under a co ordinated library plan southeastern library association because of these three interstate forces philanthropic foundations educational and other cultural movements and federal agencies and the necessity of dealing with them on a regional basis librarians of the southeast have steadily tended to strengthen their interstate associations as a necessary connecting link between their state and national associations in november  the librarians of the nine southeastern states formed the southeastern library association for nearly thirty years this association functioned as a confederation of state library associations it met biennially charged no dues published no journal and had no authority to contract or act officially for the librarians or libraries of the region but as the three interstate forces acted ever more powerfully on the resources of the region librarians became increasingly aware of the fact that unless one articulate voice for librarianship were found in the southeast these forces would either act on library matters without the consent of librarians or neglect libraries altogether certainly regional policy conferences to which all other professional and cultural movements sent single delegates could hardly welcome nine delegates from the area of librarianship at the first postwar meeting of the southeastern library association in  wilson and milczewski op cit p
