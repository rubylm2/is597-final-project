subsoil of peace henry m wriston it is one of the good fortunes of mankind that actualities do not accord with descriptions for men are prone to extravagant expressions which if they represented reality would defeat all our hopes and dreams characteristic of this tendency to overstatement is a current phrase worn smooth in the stream of conversation and official utterance total war has been used so often and so widely that it is taken for granted and becomes a barrier rather than a guide to understanding the struggle in some connotations and with proper technical reservations the expression is useful it indicates the profoundly dislocating effect of war in a world as delicately intermeshed as ours social and economic dislocations spread in ever widening circles in several respects however the phrase tends to confuse rather than clarify our ideas in the first place this cliche carries an underlying assumption that total war is a new phenomenon in human history earlier experience is made to seem invalid and the concept of a fundamental historical discontinuity is promoted the assumption and the inferences it stimulates are incorrect and misleading it is true that mechanized warfare requires the labor of many more workmen for every combat soldier than in earlier times but the difference is relative it is true also that modern care of casualties necessitates an elaboration of organization which did not previously exist but the engrossment of the energies of a large section of the populace for the civilian support of the fighting man is no new thing under the sun in the days of the french revolution for example there was a people army and everyone was expected to perform some function the decree read in the convention on august   ran as follows all citizens must discharge their debt to liberty some will give their labor others their wealth some their counsel others their strength all will give it the blood that flows in their veins thus all frenchmen all sexes all ages are called  to defend liberty from this moment until  the enemies shall have been driven from the

 the library quarterly the discovery of america was an incident to a profound dislocation of a vital interdependence that is a familiar and dramatic instance but we should remember that it is far from unique interdependence is old and the more history is studied the older and more powerful its influences are seen to be in yet another manner the phrase total war is misleading it is so magnificently inclusive as to give the impression that all aspects of life are dominated by the war that is an underestimation of mankind human nature has both a profundity and a resiliency which that assumption disregards the mind of man is so various so rich and so powerful that it simultaneously takes into account a wide variety of activities and except for moments of overwhelming drama it participates in many parallel and simultaneous activities which may be lost to sight while subconsciously pursued the power of recovery moreover is so great that the waters of life can close over a long history of tragedy and display soon afterward an unbroken calm one has but to read the poetry and memoirs of soldiers or become familiar with their humor to see that even in the midst of the shattering sensations of battle itself there is an intellectual and moral and social life upon a wholly different emotional plane contrasting with and complementing the dreadful experiences of carnage indeed sanity depends upon ability to hold onto the elements of normal life total war however tends to conceal the substantial reality that the economic and social and moral tragedy through which we are now passing is not absolute it tends also to intimate that there is complete absorption in strife yet the realities are quite different from those inferences with all its brutalities and terrors there are vital forces not only within individual human lives but also within national and even international life which war does not wholly dominate if the phrase total war were to be taken in its full and literal sense then the concept of peace would cease to exist yet it is the essence of war as a political instrument that it is a brief and violent means to ends quite different there must be room outside its false totality therefore not only for some other idea but indeed for the major idea otherwise we are forced to adopt the nazi concept of war as the normal state and peace as only an abnormal interlude at a time when it seems as though all the ties which bind men in unity have dissolved when so much emphasis is put upon the forces that divide us and when nation is pitted against nation as though for
