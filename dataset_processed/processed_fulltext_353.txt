the library quarterly volume  july  number  founding mothers the contribution of women organizations to public library development in the united states paula d watson the work of women voluntary associations in support of free public libraries in the united states in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is examined in this article this review addresses work at the local level by individual clubs as well as activities of state federations and of the national coordinating body the general federation of women clubs activities studied include widespread club support of traveling libraries clubwomen work for library legislation especially to establish state library extension agencies and local efforts to found libraries the cooperation of organized women groups with the american library association state library associations and state library commissions is explored as well as early support to library education findings are placed in the context of library historical writing to suggest that a substantial contribution to american public library development has thus far received insufficient attention introduction after the civil war associations of women began to spring up all over the united states in large cities small towns and even in frontier outposts these clubs had antecedents as anne firor scott has recently  this research was supported in part by a grant from the university of illinois research board i am grateful to anne firor scott w k boyd professor of history emerita at duke university for encouraging this research in its initial stages and for providing helpful advice thanks are also due to donald w krummel graduate school of library and information science university of illinois at urbana champaign and wayne a wiegand school of library and information studies at the university of wisconsin madison for reading the manuscript and providing substantive comments  university of illinois library university of illinois at urbana champaign  west gregory drive urbana illinois  library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved     
 the library quarterly shown in ladies benevolent societies civil war soldiers aid churchrelated groups and other organizations formed for the purpose of moral reform earlier in the nineteenth century  the availability of factory made household goods and low cost domestic labor began to produce leisure time in the lives of women of the developing middle class that they used to pursue what was commonly called self culture women who already had higher educational attainments were interested in continued learning and broadened intellectual horizons those with less formal schooling sought a means to educate themselves to accomplish these ends bands of women began to gather together all over the country to form study clubs and reading circles these proliferated according to scott as if some very contagious virus was loose in the female population  p  while this widespread and unplanned phenomenon was taking place a more systematic and intentional development was occurring in the east that eventually led to the formation of the general federation of women clubs gfwc a national organization that was to embrace a wide variety of political and social causes in the years to come this federation would in time embrace many of the little clubs forming everywhere nationwide and give focus and drive to their individual efforts the history of the gfwc began with the formation by jane c croly of a club in new york called sorosis croly a successful newspaperwoman was moved to form sorosis as a professional women club when she was denied access to a lecture by the touring charles dickens at the press club of new york croly decided that it was time women had their own associations and sorosis was born when after twenty one years the club was about to celebrate the anniversary of its majority croly conceived the idea of inviting other prominent eastern women clubs to join in commemorating the event at this meeting in  the assembled clubs agreed to form themselves into a federation the general federation of women clubs held its first biennial meeting in   many of these causes are readily identifiable as women issues the gfwc took an early interest in the betterment of public education from kindergarten to the university also placing an emphasis on adult education and university extension a focus on improving the lives of women and children addressed conditions of work for females and child workers the study of home economics and support of higher education for women related areas of interest included postal savings banks for small wage earners civil service reform uniform labor laws and various aspects of public health branching out from this base the gfwc interested itself in a whole range of environmental issues including civic improvement conservation and reclamation and the protection of natural resource treasures such as the palisades the california redwoods the appalachian and white mountains and the everglades add to these concerns clean air and water wildlife preservation prison reform native american welfare the americanization of immigrants and occupational health and safety issues and the foregoing is still only a partial list of causes supported by the gfwc
founding mothers  by the third biennial in  the federation was beginning to move from a focus on its own structure and procedures to an action agenda for improvements in society libraries were an early and prominent item on this agenda meanwhile the same evolution from a focus on self improvement to civic improvement was occurring at the local level as scott observed the clubs seemed to share some inner dynamic leading them to feel at some point that they had done enough for themselves and now owed something to the larger community  p  libraries were among the very earliest objects of club interest in community development clubs frequently collected libraries for their members use in connection with their study and discussion activities and members were imbued with the idea of the importance of books in improving the quality of life early on they often shared their libraries with women in other clubs or with others in the community before long they became interested in sharing books on a broader scale sending libraries to remote areas where access to reading material of any kind particularly for women and children was severely limited individual clubs and later state federations of clubs organized traveling libraries for the benefit of those for whom books were an almost unknown luxury at the same time that women were organizing traveling libraries they often became interested in the establishment of libraries for use by the citizens in their own towns in fact a number of women clubs were formed with this express purpose in mind the period under consideration here roughly  to  was a period of very rapid growth in the number of free public libraries in the united states women clubs contributed in a very tangible way to the spread of the public library idea and to the foundation of numerous libraries in cities and towns across the country mrs charles a perkins writing in june  on library extension work in the federation bulletin the official organ of the gfwc asserted that clubs had established  free public libraries  p  in  the executive secretary of the american library association g b utley speaking at the federation biennial program on libraries stated that fully one half the libraries in the country had been established through the influence of american women  p  in  sophonisba breckenridge writing as a contributor to a presidential commission report on social trends in the united states reported that the american library association then credited women clubs with the responsibility for initiating seventy five percent of the public libraries now in existence in the united states  p   breckinridge gives no specific source for ala report on the number of libraries formed by women the figure has been quoted since without attribution or with breckinridge as the source utley report of a figure consistent with the later breckinridge statement implies that ala was in fact keeping track but the actual ala record has
 the library quarterly when clubwomen conceived the idea of founding a public library they set about raising money this they did in the way that women have always done and to some extent continue to do through bake sales entertainments tag days and other small scale fund raising events books were donated by members or other townspeople or purchased from funds earned by the club often they were cataloged by club members libraries might start housed in clubhouses or even in private homes or in donated storefront space in some towns the clubs organized stock companies sold shares identified sites hired architects and saw buildings built they often continued to provide financial support to libraries once they were established or provided gifts of books or furniture in addition to their personal philanthropy which in some cases was substantial women clubs made the case in many communities for carnegie gifts of library buildings library interests involved clubs in advocacy for various forms of legislation in some states laws were needed to enable municipalities to provide tax support to libraries as a natural outgrowth of their interest in traveling libraries clubs lobbied in favor of state support to library extension activities especially through the formation of state library commissions clubwomen acted often as the first librarians in the libraries they established and they recognized early on the importance of appropriate training sometimes they arranged this for themselves on a local basis but more often their experiences convinced them of the need for a paid librarian and of the value of formal professional education for library workers in many states federated women played an advocacy role for library education similarly in states such as texas and oklahoma the state federations were the driving force behind the formation of state librarians associations clubwomen were sometimes members some took formal library training and a few became professionals conversely many prominent library leaders of the time such as lutie stearns clara baldwin and gratia countryman were also active clubwomen turn of the century librarians were fulsome in their praise of the work of women clubs in  for example phineas windsor then librarian at the university of texas wrote as in most of the thus far remained elusive although the founding body is listed in federal government statistical compilations of the period it is not always possible to tell when a library association is listed as founder or whether the group was a women or a men group or a general association of townspeople  fannie rawson for example chaired the kentucky federation traveling library committee the federation worked hard for legislation to establish a state library commission and rawson became its secretary after completing work for a degree in library science
founding mothers  newer states the movement in our own state for the establishment of libraries free to all the people is largely in the hands of club women and the initial progress of this form of educational activity must be largely attributed to their zealous and persistent work  p  the story of women club contributions to the public library movement has many strands and its chapters are found in multiple sources published and unpublished published sources include city histories library histories the histories and other published records of state federations of women clubs and the general federation histories of individual clubs library literature contemporary with the movement and later reports unpublished sources include the archival records of individual clubs the state federations and the gfwc personal papers of prominent clubwomen and related documents such as the carnegie library correspondence library historians have thus far provided only a minimal record of the substantial contribution of women organizations to public library development an omission to which scott drew attention in   the older standard texts include only brief mention of the role of women groups sydney ditzion in arsenals of a democratic culture takes a paragraph to evaluate the thesis that clubs were a major factor in the spread of libraries particularly in the midwest and rejects the notion that their contribution was of any importance  p  in carnegie libraries george bobinski does not identify women clubs as having any special place as the driving force for carnegie grants in many communities he spends a paragraph or two describing petitioners who might seem to have made themselves somewhat ridiculous in the arguments they chose to include in their applications to carnegie and he includes a few anecdotes about clubs in this context at least calling attention to the fact that it was the women club in many towns that undertook to contact carnegie  p  a few studies of state library development highlight the role of women clubs in his review of texas public library development donald davis amply demonstrates the central role played by the texas federation of women clubs  ray held in his history of the beginnings of public libraries in california identifies some early ladies libraries and marks a growing involvement of women clubs that was to manifest itself in the years beyond the scope of his study in the last quarter of the nineteenth century  women library work in california is also explored by victoria musmann  mary anders thesis on library development in the southeastern states reviews the substantial contributions of women clubs in this region beginning in the s with an intense interest in support of traveling libraries  david taylor provides an account of a local club founding and maintaining of a library in arkansas  and in
 the library quarterly a recent article joanne passet mentions club support to traveling libraries  no comprehensive systematic documentation exists however of what appears to have been a massive nationwide influence on the growth of one of our most important public institutions especially outside of the urban areas of the northeast it is the purpose of this article to provide an introduction to and overview of this significant and complex contribution of women to the social and intellectual fabric of american life spreading the library idea traveling libraries and state library commissions libraries very soon attracted the interest of women clubs as they began to turn outward organizing themselves to work for the public good a morning session of the  biennial meeting of the general federation was entirely devoted to libraries in the report of the proceedings of that session the chair summarized the widespread efforts for libraries already underway a very large percentage of the clubs belonging to this federation are actively engaged in library work indeed it seems to be common ground on which we all meet  p  as state federations began to be formed library work was often given the highest priority for example the first business resolution of the indiana union of literary clubs in  advanced the idea that the general assembly commemorate the state centennial by a liberal appropriation and a wise law authorizing the establishment and perpetual maintenance of libraries accessible to the whole state  p  similarly in texas mrs j c terrell proposed libraries as the initial work of the association and in  rather audaciously issued a call for the state superintendent of education the president of the state university and three other gentlemen to form an advisory board to the federation library committee to aid their work in building public sentiment in favor of libraries  p  quite independently and in some cases long before work for libraries became the focus of the state and national organizations women all over the united states were forming groups for the express  records in the gfwc archives of the programs of early biennials are sparse making it necessary to rely on the published proceedings for information on activities and on the federation magazine of the time period the federation organ changed publishers and tides frequently during these years especially before   the resolution addressed the provision permitting towns to levy taxes only in support of libraries valued at at least one thousand dollars which discouraged the formation of small libraries
founding mothers  purpose of founding free public libraries in their own communities these efforts some of which began immediately after the civil war are described in more detail in a later section of this article at the same time that women were organizing to advocate for libraries the states began to assume a responsibility for the growth of public libraries akin to the responsibility they had taken in the development of a system of free public education massachusetts was the first state to create an agency to foster the spread of libraries with legislation in  establishing the first state library commission the commission idea took hold rapidly in the northeast several new england states established agencies within a few years using the massachusetts legislation as a model new york too created a body to oversee library development as a part of the university of the state of new york melvil dewey who was then state librarian at albany and director of the home education department of the university conceived a new means for spreading the knowledge of books and libraries an idea that came to be integrated into the programs of library commissions in many other states in  dewey established a system of traveling libraries onehundred volume collections of popular books that could be sent out to areas of the state where citizens had no access to a library twenty five taxpayers could request such a collection upon payment of a five dollar fee for transportation and a guaranty of security for the books dewey the originator of the early motto of the american library association the best reading at the least cost for the greatest number put his thinking into large scale practice with the creation of the traveling library system in new york state during the first full year of its operation  volumes were sent out and the idea of traveling libraries spread rapidly from state to state in another of the parallel developments that seem to characterize this period of public library history women clubs in several states were maintaining traveling library systems on their own long before library commissions had been formed in their states or state associations of librarians had been organized or taken up the idea  p    p  in delaware for example the general assembly was induced to provide an annual appropriation of one hundred dollars directly to the delaware federation of women clubs to aid their traveling library work in  by  when a library commission was established several traveling libraries had been assembled by the clubs with state support in addition to the twenty two that were created entirely from individual club resources these fifteen hundred volumes were passed on by the federation to the commission upon its establishment  p  similarly in maryland women clubs went into the traveling library business before the state did the first traveling library in maryland
 the library quarterly consisted of books donated in  by the hytheham club of port deposit subsequently a federation committee was formed to draw up a bill to legalize traveling libraries and obtain a four thousand dollar appropriation for them this bill which also established a state library commission was passed in   p  in vermont too the state commission began its work by taking over the traveling libraries of the vermont federation in  dewey assembled an overview of the origins and progress of the traveling library concept he had initiated eight years earlier entitled field and future of traveling libraries  a lengthy section on activities in thirty four other states was included the fact that some states are represented by only short paragraphs referring to library journal or public libraries makes clear that the compiler was attempting to be quite comprehensive in the review and had supplemented information obtained in more direct ways with research in the contemporary literature in these summaries the activities of women clubs in support of traveling libraries are given a prominent place in state after state usually a section of their own federations of women clubs in a large number of states are given credit for obtaining passage of legislation supporting appropriations to traveling library programs or establishing library commissions dewey attention to women club work for traveling libraries is representative of a growing recognition on the part of the infant library profession of the debt owed to the clubs by librarians and the general public alike women clubs appeared to have an immediate and deep affinity for the idea of traveling libraries as has been mentioned earlier they often began by developing libraries to share with other clubs to support the wide ranging topical study that was their earliest purpose when systematic support of traveling libraries in some states began clubs were among the heaviest users of available services their lively appreciation for the role of books in their own lives however filled clubwomen with a desire to share the fruits of reading with others like the librarians of the period they saw the traveling library as a natural adjunct of the public school and as a major force for general public education they hoped that traveling libraries would awaken the desire for a free public library wherever there was none more than this they saw these hundred volume collections as a means for improving the lives of ordinary people living in harsh and relatively deprived conditions the traveling library work of massachusetts clubwomen is representa in view of the formative role of clubwomen in relation to public libraries in many states a study of what they read and what books they wished to put in the hands of others might yield important results for a clearer understanding of the public library as a cultural institution
founding mothers  tive of this missionary zeal library committee chairwomen in other states frequently cite massachusetts as the ideal of library service they were striving to achieve when other states were only beginning to pass library legislation and to establish large numbers of public libraries massachusetts could boast a free library in practically every one of its towns despite this happy situation massachusetts clubwomen still found ways to work for the spread of libraries a report of the education committee of the massachusetts federation of women clubs describes an impulse in  to reach beyond state borders our hearts turned to the race of anglo saxons in the southern mountains a race of people eager for knowledge and books but cut off by a formation of the country from many advantages  p  the federation had already worked cooperatively with georgia women to establish the massachusetts model school in georgia and now asked its membership to supply books for traveling libraries to be sent to parts of the carolinas tennessee kentucky and georgia word of this activity spread to women in other states and appeals came also from oklahoma florida and the dakotas massachusetts clubs responded with thousands of books and these were sent to be distributed in a systematic way by clubwomen in the recipient states with these books went also the cordial good fellowship the sympathy and friendship of every massachusetts woman to her far away kinswoman in many another state  p   even in new york where the modern traveling library had its origin and where the system had substantial state support from the outset clubwomen still played an important role dewey reported that a federation committee was appointed to work closely with the state library the plan of work of this committee was to be duplicated by state library committees of federated clubs and in localities all over the country the committee undertook to work for the establishment of free libraries where none existed to encourage small libraries already in existence to convert subscription libraries to free libraries to promote traveling libraries to raise the standard of school library books and to cooperate with the state library in preparing reading lists to accomplish these goals the committee proposed to form a network of workers each assigned to a specific district of the state each worker could choose what she believed to be the most effective method to promote library interests spreading the word through correspondence newspaper articles or by visits to localities all would be responsible to organize meetings within their districts inviting librarians especially those from small li may alden ward mentions the sending of over twelve thousand books to various places in the west and the south  p 
 the library quarterly braries and all members of the public interested in books and reading in practice these meetings would be ia section meeting of the new york library association except that the subjects under discussion shall be popular rather than technical  pp   activities such as those outlined in this federation work plan as tasks for clubwomen later became the assigned responsibilities of librarians hired by state library commissions as organizers in some of the midwestern states where state support of library extension activities took longer to establish clubwomen maintained extensive traveling library circuits supported for years entirely from their own resources of time energy and practical benevolence in illinois clubwomen maintained three hundred traveling libraries from  to  that were turned over to the state once legislation for a library commission was finally passed mrs charles a perkins in the article cited above reported that thirty four states with federations belonging to the gfwc had among them  traveling libraries with a total of  volumes and that in  clubs still controlled  of these with  volumes  the earliest states to establish library commissions after massachusetts included new hampshire connecticut vermont and wisconsin women clubs were already supporting traveling libraries in all these states women were also playing an active role in library work in ohio and georgia the next two states to create commissions in many states where commissions were founded subsequently the state federation played a primary role in securing the relevant legislation federations also worked for appropriations in support of traveling library and other commission programs mrs perkins noted that club work had procured  in state appropriations for traveling libraries  p  in indiana the idea of a state library commission was suggested and promoted by merica hoagland who was president of the indiana union of literary clubs in  after visits to libraries and attendance at library association meetings to gain an understanding of the need a federation committee drafted legislation clubwomen lobbied hard for the bill writing letters to their assemblymen and the newspapers obtaining candidates pledges of support in election campaigns and testifying at hearings on the bill which passed in   indiana women efforts to secure legislation in support of library commissions and related library extension efforts were duplicated in many other states during the first decade of the century perhaps the most charmingly recounted history of a female campaign for a state library commission and the most generally illuminating is the story of the two hundred women of the columbian club of boise idaho the account is provided in a talk by mrs e j dockery to a roundtable
founding mothers  meeting of the american library association in  published in library journal  aside from some verbal excesses in regard to the generally uplifting role of women in society mrs dockery speaks clearly and modestly but not without a certain coyness especially in relation to the stronger sex the program she describes to mobilize support for library legislation however had impact comprehensiveness and sophistication worthy of a modern day political action committee campaign the women of the columbian club experienced an evolution in the development of their thinking about libraries that was typical for a women club of the time they began by accumulating sufficient resources to inaugurate a system of fifteen traveling libraries totaling eight hundred volumes they promoted their work in the press and stressed the importance of traveling libraries to idaho teachers at their state association meeting as it became more difficult to satisfy the demand they themselves had created they began to think in terms of lobbying for state support to library extension they targeted each of the seventyfive newspapers in idaho with press releases and formed an effective alliance with educators trading their support of a bill supporting school libraries for teacher support of public library legislation they campaigned for candidates who declared themselves on the right side identified a highly visible sponsor for their two bills testified before the relevant legislative committees and buttonholed every legislator but one before the bill came to the floor on the day for final action in the legislature the two hundred clubwomen appeared en masse mrs dockery describes how the senators had a little joke at the expense of the ladies indicative of their rather paternalistic attitude imagine our consternation when the question was submitted to an aye or nay vote at not a voice being raised in its favor save senator donnelly the bill sponsor for a few moments silence so profound it was almost palpable prevailed when presently senator kincaid who was in the chair without calling for the nays solemnly announced he ayes have it and delight supplanted our agonized distress as the pleasantry at senator donnelly expense and ours dawned upon us  p  in passing the bill the senators wished it expressly understood that they did so because intimidated by the presence of the columbian club in the lower house only the member who had not been buttonholed by a clubwoman voted against the measure he too played the tease saying his protest vote was the result of being neglected it was clearly a gallant occasion and the best of spirits prevailed deference to the ladies was maintained when the bill was put before the governor for signature elaborately prepared and adorned with the club colors by attaches of the legislature  p 
 the library quarterly for all the levity and amused paternal benevolence on the part of the legislators it is obvious that the women of boise got what they wanted and in a most effective way the commission law as passed specified that at least two of the five members be women the first idaho commission had in fact four female appointees all of whom were clubwomen with two from boise mrs dockery was well aware of the role played by idaho women access to the ballot the most powerful and bloodless offensive and defensive weapon on earth  p  the well orchestrated and concerted campaign mounted by the columbian club in favor of a cause in which they believed represents a changing sense of themselves experienced by women of this era the ladies of boise still knew their place but were finding their voice and beginning to feel their power there is little doubt that the state federations of women clubs can claim credit for the passage of legislation in many states to establish library commissions although in some states it took longer for success to crown their efforts than in others fourteen years in illinois for example where commissions were slow in coming the state federations frequently took on the functions typically performed by these agencies in  in kentucky for example the first work of the newly formed committee on library extension was to perform a survey of library conditions statewide in its second year of existence the maine state library commission did exactly the same thing the kentucky federa this demonstration of the organizational capabilities and political acumen of women club members is very different from the portrait of diffidence and timidity presented by ring in a recent analysis of the failure of carnegie initiatives in seven midwestern towns  the sweeping indictment implied by the title of his piece is completely unsupported by the evidence he presents and is dangerously misleading ring characterization of women club culture is based entirely on a fictional source helen santmyer novel  and ladies of the club his argument assigning carnegie failures to the defects of club culture rests primarily on events in three towns burr oak and grand ledge michigan and chardon ohio in burr oak he accuses the women of alienating the public by their smug and condescending attitude in claiming credit for the work they did for a municipal library but he is not really able to show why the tax levy for a carnegie library failed ring appears to tax the women of grand ledge with sins of omission rather than commission implying that since they were able to mount a successful campaign in  after the carnegie offer had been withdrawn they should have been able to do so earlier in chardon no one assumed a leadership role various actors worked at cross purposes confusion arose over architect plans disputes developed over the site and basically the city council was unable to meet carnegie standard financial requirements chardon presents a typical example of a town that could not get itself organized behind the idea of a carnegie library for reasons that remain obscure however ring holds the women club ultimately responsible for its failure even in this his best example the tie ring posits between a women club culture short on political sophistication and long on moral superiority is appallingly tenuous
founding mothers  tion also established a fund in that same year to pay for a librarian to supervise its traveling libraries program again much as a state library commission would do  p  georgia was among the earliest states to pass legislation establishing a library commission in  but no funds were actually appropriated to support the work of the agency until  georgia clubwomen like their counterparts in other states rushed in to fill the void they organized a system of traveling libraries both to support club study and to meet the needs of the ordinary citizens in remote areas mrs j k ottley of atlanta is quoted by dewey on traveling library work in georgia as follows each club secures by every means possible all the books and magazines it can and distributes them by hand as loan libraries in remote districts through its own country this saves carriage and gives the women of each club a personal interest which they could not feel if all the work emanated from one central head  pp   mrs ottley goes on to describe the somewhat unique approach to library organizing practiced by georgia women their plan was to target communities where there were rural schools as future homes for public libraries clubwomen from atlanta for instance worked to establish neighborhood library associations in each of the fifty six towns with schools in fulton county these associations were planned to include both men and women potentially interested in founding a library once the group was established the women clubs lent a small book collection to the association as an incentive to work toward establishing a town library cooperation of teachers and state and county education officials was easily obtained federations that had worked for the foundation of state commissions felt a continuing responsibility to support their work and in turn the commissions often looked upon the federations as their strongest allies whether or not they owed their existence to women work even after fourteen years of unceasing labor to obtain a library commission in illinois clubwomen did not rest for a moment upon their laurels the state federation of clubs is responsible for the establishment of the library commission and it should do everything in its power to promote the commissions sic interest through cooperation at every point  p  in  in indiana the federation pledged to assist the state commission six years after its founding in organizing public libraries in the  towns and cities where none yet existed  the library commissioners of maine readily acknowledged that the agency owed its existence to the state federation and turned immediately to women clubs for help in its initial work of founding an effective system of traveling libraries the commission deemed it a privilege to be able to consult with a prominent officer of the federation in the matter
 the library quarterly of selecting books for inclusion in the libraries and issued a call to the clubs to defray the five dollar fee for placing libraries in the towns most needing them but least able to afford them it is to the club women of maine that the commission most confidently looks for assistance through them it hopes to come into touch with communities that are ready for the traveling library it is relying on them to create interest in the traveling library in places where at present there is no interest  p  the response was general and generous and the commission was clearly grateful for whatever success has been achieved for whatever good has been done for whatever more may result from the seed now sown full credit must be given to the women of the state  pp   although wisconsin clubwomen were quite active in library work the state library commission did not owe its existence to their efforts but rather to those of f a hutchins who became commissioner and senator j h stout who had himself set up a circuit of traveling libraries in his own county and given personal financial support to summer schools for librarians in madison nevertheless hutchins who was generally regarded as one of the most able of state library commissioners maintained the most cordial relations with women clubs for example mrs dockery of boise formerly of wisconsin in the speech described above thanks hutchins for providing advice and literature for the idaho campaign hutchins attitude toward the value of club work is typified by a speech to the annual meeting of the wisconsin state federation of women clubs in madison in  his purpose was to lay out projects in library extension for the federation to pursue jointly with the commission he urges support of three programs upon the assembly improvement of home libraries increasing training opportunities for librarians and extending library services to the farm population in connection with the latter two he asks the federation to appoint committees to study the issues formally and report their findings so as to arouse public opinion in favor of legislative action in a parting shot he reminds clubwomen that five hundred more traveling libraries are needed and clearly implies that he is depending on them for a substantial fundraising effort  p  lutie stearns chair of the general federation library extension committee chief of the traveling library department of the wisconsin state library commission and an early library leader summarized the progress of library commission work and cooperative relations between clubs and commissions in her report to the eleventh gfwc biennial conference in  she observed that fifteen states did not yet have library commissions and eight did not yet have library associations suggesting that the best work for clubs in these states was to remedy these

founding mothers  no carnegie gifts as ditzion puts it the free library had started on a firm foundation in new england and doubtless would in time have embedded itself in the public consciousness of the entire nation  p  it seems clear however that the natural self propagation of the library idea posited by ditzion and bobinski was aided by strenuous efforts to open the public mind to it both in new england and in other regions of the country the awakening of public sentiment in favor of libraries was the chosen work of state federations of women clubs and individual clubs all over the united states a thorough valuation of their contribution that also considers the work of other organizations men groups for example and takes into account the work of library commissions and state associations of librarians and club support of these efforts remains to be done a more detailed examination is required of the character of the social libraries women established after the civil war comparing them with their male founded predecessors more study is needed too of the differential spread of libraries in the various parts of the country exploring the factors that retarded or accelerated development from region to region the early close cooperation between clubs and librarians at the national state and local levels needs further investigation as does the influence of the values of clubwomen on library services for example services to children detailed study leading to an overall assessment of the role of women organizations in public library development may also contribute to the understanding of nineteenth century feminism a topic of continuing interest for social historians women activities in support of libraries represent the kind of institution building and assertion of power through influence that gerda lerner identified as important topics for study in the women in history approach she advocated for the emerging field of women history in the s lerner in fact included the clubwoman along with the working woman and the trade union activist among the anonymous women whose lives she thought should be studied more closely in order to establish the origins of the feminist consciousness   one school of feminist and social historical thought argues that the cult of true womanhood the set of victorian ideals of piety purity domesticity and submissiveness that barbara welter argued victimized and circumscribed women  was actually used to advantage by some late nineteenth century women to move their activities from the private to the public sphere this line of reasoning holds that since women were assigned the role of guardians of culture and upholders of moral values by their society they subtly shifted their focus as their domestic burdens diminished from inside the home to the world at large this shift it is argued allowed them to become powerful social reformers
 the library quarterly and to move into what were becoming the feminized professions for example teaching social work and librarianship julie matthaei among others notes this phenomenon and assigns the term social housekeeping to the activities in the public sector assumed by women of this period  pp   social historians who point to the importance of these developments align themselves with lerner and scott who argued early on that feminism and new self concepts for women did not arise solely from the fight for suffrage others are more skeptical of the true progress of ordinary women toward a radical revision in their understanding of the patriarchal concepts defining their place in society during this period these writers maintain that welter woman as victim model remains a valid one for the nineteenth century  in her detailed study of the women club movement the clubwoman as feminist karen blair asserts that clubwomen were representatives of what she chooses to call domestic feminism  in her view they manipulated their accepted role in society as upholders of cultural and moral values to escape from women accepted domestic sphere they gained strength from association and a shared vision of societal improvement and found ways to influence events they had never known before in her review of blair book however patricia palmieri concludes that the author contrary to her intent ends by validating the view that the prescriptive myth of womanhood really did constitute the reality and that in fact only a small number of clubwomen were truly feminists  blair does not spend a significant amount of time discussing club work for libraries but her book and the criticism of it by feminist scholars illustrates well why a comprehensive study of the library interests of organized women is likely to provide important insight not only into the history of american library development as discussed above but also into the origins of modern feminism blair portrait of club culture in part supports the widespread view that it was a white middle class phenomenon aimed primarily at advancing middle class values she notes for example the failure of the efforts of the boston women educational and industrial union to achieve meaningful benefits for working class women and claims no more enlightenment for clubwomen on racial issues than the society of which they were a part catherine clinton another writer on nineteenth century women pro for example jill conway concludes that even jane addams one of the most dynamic social reformers of the period remained imprisoned in traditional concepts of femininity 
founding mothers  vides a different perspective on the success of women clubs in crossing class lines in her brief portrait of the chicago women club cwc and its several successful projects on behalf of working class women she also points out that cwc interests in education were broad enough to embrace support of an industrial school for boys moreover clinton uses the chicago case to advance views similar to blair on clubwomen as feminists pointing out that by  two thirds of club members were involved in its more activist committees and that cwc women also founded a variety of other reform movements in chicago as she puts it the women of this organization were decidedly activist and many if not most were feminists  p  in one of her early essays on how feminist values were spread through a women network scott addresses the question of the nineteenthcentury woman as victim or feminist by observing quite reasonably that there was surely a continuum of thinking along which women arrayed themselves sometimes with a great deal of ambivalence  further study of clubwomen devotion to the spread of libraries should help to illuminate the stages on this continuum some women may have seen libraries as wood suggests as a means to achieve the triumph of conventional values others saw them as providing opportunities for truly improving the quality of life of others less fortunate than themselves some thought it beyond their place to contact andrew carnegie and asked male friends or husbands to do it others wrote directly or sought appointments some buttonholed legislators in idaho others undoubtedly sat quietly in the gallery waiting for the vote as with the history of libraries little detailed work has yet been done on clubs outside major cities where the evils of a burgeoning lower class were less evident also little has been done to differentiate among clubwomen and the motivations they may have had based on education marital status age or other possibly salient factors such as place of birth and in a westward moving society residence history detailed examination of club work for libraries also has excellent potential for adding to our understanding of an awakening feminine political consciousness since it involved women in such a high degree of organized political advocacy and ultimately resulted in fairly large scale female participation in appointive political office on library boards and commissions despite the work of scott blair and others there is still much to learn about the  theodora penny martin  has also written a book on women clubs that stresses the self culture aspect of the associations with a detailed portrait of the decatur art class some writers on the role of women in the profession of librarianship advocate the application of the various models of women history to this type of research and illustrate the difficulties in regard to sources in connection with this work
