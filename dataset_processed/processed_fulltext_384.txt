volume  october  number paper deacidification a preliminary report richard daniel smith introduction qo ne of the critical problems facing librarians in their efforts to preserve recorded knowledge is the deterioration of paper the basic material of communication a major cause of paper deterioration over prolonged periods is identified as the acid catalyzed hydrolysis of the cellulose in paper fibers it is estimated that  per cent of the books published from  to  will be unusable for general library purposes within thirty five years if protective measures to reduce the rate of hydrolysis are not taken the deacidification of paper is known to reduce the rate of this deterioration and it is believed that a deacidification treatment would extend the useful life of such library materials by several times although deacidification processes are applied to preserve rare and valuable paper records there appears to be no practical process for librarians to use in the deacidification of ordinary books the purpose of this paper is to develop an approach to a practical treatment for the wet deacidification of paper in books stored in libraries the paper deterioration originating from lack of durability may be contrasted to the deterioration which derives from lack of permanence a fragile bible paper may be highly permanent but not durable sandpaper is durable but is not required to be highly permanent durability is the degree to which a paper retains its original qualities under continual usage permanence is that property ascribed to a material which under specified conditions resists changes with the passage of time the permanence of paper refers to the retention of significant use properties particularly folding endurance and color over prolonged periods it is affected by temperature humidity light and the presence of chemical agents see american pulp and paper association  pp    and the discussion of clapp  for an exhaustive discussion of the mechanisms of cellulose degradation see ott spurlin and grafflin  pp  for specific references to questions see jarrell hankins and veitch  shearon  and barrow and sproull  aper presented at the annual meeting of the international institute for conservation of historic and artistic works american group at the art institute of chicago june   it is a preliminary report of work being done on the author phd dissertation at the graduate library school university of chicago ee r w church  pp   if the books then  to  years old would fall into a less frequently used category however they might withstand infrequent though not general library use see fussler and simon  particularly appendix h distribution of books by the frequency of their use pp h h  barrow a pp   
 thie library quarterly methodology for this search will consist of  summarizing the current wet processes for deacidifying paper  considering certain improvements in practice which appear desirable and  postulating based on preliminary findings how these improvements might be attained limitations this discussion will focus upon the degradation of the cellulose in paper fibers which is caused by acid catalyzed hydrolysis it will not consider other causes of paper deterioration unless a very direct relationship with acid hydrolysis is involved nor will it concern itself with the sources of the acidity this investigation assumes that the primary cause of the lack of permanence exhibited by book papers in libraries is the acid catalyzed hydrolysis of cellulose when the ph of an aqueous paper extract is below  or perhaps  generally a paper with a nearly neutral or mildly alkaline ph as measured by an aqueous extract is found to deteriorate more slowly during extended storage than a similar paper with a significantly lower ph the rate of paper deterioration usually increases as the ph decreases therefore this report considers that the permanence of an acidic paper is improved if a significant shift in the hydrogen ion content ph results from a deacidification treatment the reader should remember that other causes of paper deterioration can be and frequently are more significant than acid catalyzed hydrolysis of cellulose several familiar examples come immediately to mind  the wear and tear caused by patron use  the effect on paper of light of heat and of humidity variation and  the results of bacteria fungi and insect and rodent attack in general this presentation will consider that the cellulose in paper fibers or the paper fibers themselves are in an idealized condition this means that all of the paper fibers in the paper substrate are construed to contain a uniform quality of cellulose or more broadly stated this report will neglect the differences in the rate of paper deterioration caused by variation in fiber source manufacturing procedure secondary accessory paper making materials and environmental conditions of use and storage except insofar as these involve acids acid degradation of paper fibers cellulose the primary constituent of paper fibers is a linear polysaccharide   glucan of high molecular weight it is the main solid constituent of woody plants and occurs widely elsewhere in the vegetable kingdom cellulose from the point of view of the pulp and paper industry approaches the above ideal paper fibers are not pure cellulose but never quite reaches  two methods are used for preparing paper samples for ph measurement hot or cold water extraction the results may be approximately the same on some papers on others the hot extraction may give up to  or more ph units lower results than the cold extraction the or perhaps  ph value specified refers to results obtained by the hot extraction procedure the proposed investigation plans to report the ph value of both hot and cold methods because a difference of opinion exists about which method gives the best ph value for estimating the permanence of paper the procedure for these tests is given by the technical association of the pulp and paper industry t    see byrne and weiner  and kantrowitz spencer and simmons  i w j barrow research laboratory  fig

paper deacidification  accessible this terminology complicates the problem because the percentage of crystalline cellulose does not always correspond to the percentage of non accessible cellulose when both are measured by appropriate methods the fact that some cellulose in a paper fiber is non accessible for acid degradation is demonstrated by studies which show that the average dp rarely falls below  this remains true in cases of severe acid hydrolysis hence one reason that some papers are more resistant to acid catalyzed hydrolysis than other papers is because the amount of non accessible cellulose varies from one type of fiber furnish to another literature survey the major purpose of this paper is to propose an approach to a practical treatment for paper deacidification in libraries various commentators indicate that a workable solution has not been fully developed the most useful list of studies is the annotated bibliography by byrne and weiner  although this largely duplicates and extends the  kantrowitz annotated bibliography the latter yields additional information because different abstractors prepared many of the annotations bibliographies on other aspects of paper technology are published by the institute of paper chemistry and the technical association of the pulp and paper industry tappi other guides to the literature are apca abstracts abstract bulletin abstracts    on archaeology and the fine arts environmental effects on materials and equipment section a preservation from deterioration a bstracts and of course biological abstracts and chemical abstracts barrow  a b belenaya  j a church  grove  hansen  kathpalia  a b  pravilova  spinner  and yabrova  are contributors of interesting review and summary articles the books by britt  casey  greathouse and wessel  libby  ott spurlin and grafflin  and plenderleith  are suggested for background on cellulose conservation and deterioration and paper technology the appa dictionary of paper  is recommended for clarification of paper terminology richardson recently contributed an annotated bibliography on air and water pollution most of the contributions on paper durability and permanence in the literature of library science are non technical these works deal with such questions as defining the problem speculating as to the culprit and formulating plans to find a solution or reporting on the efforts made the technical and fundamental literature is largely contributed by practicing scientists their articles are usually found in the industrial and professional journals of the paper and textile fields although much about paper deterioration is imperfectly understood the impression received from these information sources is that existing knowledge is not fully applied to improve the permanence of paper in books stored in libraries  ibid  see break for bibliophiles  clapp  and williams   institute of paper chemistry  to present and technical association of the pulp and paper industry  to present  for bibliographical citations to works and authors mentioned in this paragraph see the appended bibliography
 the library quarterly specifications of an ideal wet deacidification process it will be useful to define an ideal wet deacidification process for use  as a yardstick in analyzing the present wet deacidification processes and  as a guide to desirable improvements in practice the following five specifications provide one route toward these goals  the treatment should reduce the active acidity ph to a level where other causes of paper deterioration define the limit of useful life  the treatment should deposit a protective residue in the paper substrate to act as a buffering and stabilizing agent  the treatment should not be harmful to paper and other book components or to book users  the treatment procedure should be simple and within the capabilities of non professional people working with restricted facilities  the treatment procedure should be fast cheap and lend itself to hand or mechanized application specification  is aimed at insuring that unit costs are minimized for example it seems wasteful to promote maximum resistance to hydrolysis in a book whose useful life is determined by something else specification  derives from the accepted practice of precipitating a benign buffering agent for example calcium carbonate in the deacidified paper other benefits might result by an extension of this procedure czepiel  pp   found evidence that the brightness reversion of paper is accelerated by the presence of cupric ferrous and ferric ions studies by hudson grant and hockey  on the sulfur dioxide pickup from air by paper indicate that enough sulfur dioxide may be adsorbed into the margins of the leaves to cause deterioration their work supports langwell  p  contention that the activity of metal ions in catalyzing sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide should be inhibited perhaps the activity of these ions would be reduced as a natural consequence of deacidification the available copper and iron when in ionic form might precipitate under alkaline conditions as the respective hydroxides therefore specification  is interpreted as implying also the desirability of inhibiting the activity of the cupric ferrous and ferric ions specification  treats the problems of reversibility harmful or dangerous ingredients and reaction products and physical or chemical damage to the brightness as commonly used in the paper industry the reflectivity of a sheet of pulp paper or paperboard for specified light measured under standardized conditions on a particular instrument designed and calibrated for the purpose strictly speaking brightness is not a colorimetric quality brightness reversion a term applied to pulps especially bleached market pulps and also to hite papers and paperboards to indicate loss of brightness american pulp and paper association  pp    the terms absorption adsorption and sorption are used to describe certain phenomena by which materials may enter remain in and leave paper these terms are defined by van nostrand scientific encyclopedia  pp     interview with dr leon stock  support for the theory that a small quantity of calcium carbonate which is buffering the development of acidity will also inhibit the brightness reversion of paper at the margin of a book leaves may have been provided by hansen the margins of leaves from the  imprint studied darken progressively at the edges in contact with the atmosphere as the quantity of calcium carbonate in these leaves decreases see hansen  figs   pp  a hansen also implied that this small quantity of calcium carbonate minimum in good leaves was  per cent caco by weight might be the factor which gave the good leaves exceptional resistance to accelerated light aging hansen  p 
paper deacidification  book or its components these problems indicate that deacidification treatments should deposit benign residues whose ingredients are known to promote permanence over extended time periods the paper should retain as much of its strength as possible during treatment so as to minimize the possibility of damage from handling specification  aims toward the development of simple rules to determine the suitability of a given paper or book for treatment the latitude for error in following the treatment specifications should tolerate considerable abuse and still provide satisfactory results specification  is included because any acceptable deacidification treatment must be both economical and practical unit costs and production schedules which librarians would find acceptable are not available at this time analysis of current wet deacidification practices the concept of introducing an alkaline earth stabilizing agent into paper to increase its resistance to the deterioration caused by acid catalyzed hydrolysis appears to have developed initially at the ontario research foundation in the early  schierholtz  who assigned his patent rights to the foundation claimed a process whereby it paper is rendered non tarnishing to metals such as silver bronze etc with which it is brought into contact and inert with respect to inks and colors etc applied to the paper and more durable with age he states as a result of the treatment the paper is left substantially unchanged excepting with respect to its durability with age and tarnishing properties aqueous solutions of barium or calcium or strontium etc as their respective bicarbonates or together with their carbonates in suspension were impregnated into paper by immersion or spraying the timing of this treatment followed the other steps of paper manufacture schierholtz  also claimed that paper could be impregnated with an alkaline earth hydroxide and then treated with carbon dioxide either in gaseous form or in solution so as to form the alkaline earth stabilizing compound that is carbonate kathpalia  reviewed five wet and two dry methods of paper deacidification in  he reports that calcium hydroxide and calcium bicarbonate or magnesium bicarbonate in an aqueous solution normally form the active ingredients of wet deacidification processes kathpalia also provides useful details for the conservator as he apparently explains how the barrow immersion process is practiced at the national archives of india all of the wet deacidification processes presented appear to be chemically speaking closely related hence this paper proposes to limit its discussion to the best known wet deacidification processes only one method of paper deacidification has proved itself through general acceptance and remained in use over  reversibility in conservation terminology is defined as the ability of the conservator to remove any residue introduced into the paper by a preservation treatment a conservator wants in case of need the power to return a treated document to its condition just prior to treatment  see grant  p   schierholtz  p  and ontario research foundation  p   kathpalia  pp   ibid pp  
 the library quarterly twenty five years summarizing this wet deacidification process barrow states as developed in my laboratory this process consists of placing the document to be treated between sections of special bronze wire cloth to prevent injury and passing it through two water solutions allowing it to remain for about twenty minutes in each the first is a water solution of  per cent calcium hydroxide which effectively neutralizes the acid and the second is a water solution of approximately  per cent calcium bicarbonate which carbonates the excess hydroxide and precipitates calcium carbonate into the fibers of the paper after treatment the bronze wire cloth and document are air dried in a rack constructed for the purpose the precipitated calcium carbonate not only has a stabilizing effect upon the cellulose fiber but also acts as a buffer against the absorption of any acid at a later time barrow explains that his procedure will shift the ph of a document from the   range to the   ph range and that this treatment will theoretically extend the life expectancy of a document by a factor of from  to  times such treated documents are not believed to retain any dangerous or harmful chemicals the calcium carbonate deposited in the paper is well known to have existed side by side with cellulose fibers for hundreds of years in short if the need for a deacidification treatment is imperative the barrow procedure is the process to use despite its success in reducing acidity the barrow process has significant shortcomings which prohibit its general application to the paper in books most papers retain about  per cent of their dry strength when wet by water a wet and weak document requires very careful handling only single sheets not bound volumes can be treated the expansion and contraction of paper on wetting and drying might break the book spine andor cause cockling of the leaves and warping of the boards the leaves might be bonded together on drying by the soluble components of the paper the problems of drying large numbers of books wet by water are not resolved the alternative of dismantling the book deacidifying the leaves and rebinding costs more than libraries can afford to invest in the conservation of ordinary books barrow developed spray deacidification as a possible solution to these problems the active ingredient magnesium bicarbonate is prepared by bubbling carbon dioxide through an aqueous suspension of magnesium carbonate for two hours an addition of  per cent ethyl alcohol is made to the magnesium bicarbonate solution to facilitate handling and to reduce the tendency of the wetted paper to cockle on drying librarians apparently believe that this cheaper process as contrasted to dismantling the book treating the leaves and then rebinding is also beyond their means the literature indicates that no other organization has taken up barrow recommendation for a pilot plant study a picture of the present state of paper deacidification processes may be obtained by analyzing the two barrow treatments against the five ideal specifiarrow b pp   arrow a pp    libby    barrow research laboratory  pp  and barrow research laboratory   barrow research laboratory  p  williams  does imply that spray deacidification is practical but this writer was unable to verify through the literature that the process has been used outside of the barrow research laboratory
paper deacidification  cations the barrow treatments pass or exceed specification  and definitely deposit some quantity of a benign residue to buffer the development of further acidity no information was found as to whether this residue inhibits the activity of the cupric ferrous and ferric ions the possibility that a magnesium or calcium carbonate residue might inhibit the brightness reversion does not seem to have been evaluated consequently some reservation must be retained as to whether the barrow treatments pass specification  the barrow process that is single sheet immersion would fail specification  unless the book were dismantled and rebound otherwise both schemes could be interpreted as passing specifications  and  both barrow treatments fail specification  because the processes are slow and costly potentially useful materials in paper deacidification barrow uses precisely the chemicals known to be associated with the longterm permanence of paper the steps in aqueous deacidification processes which most increase cost are related to the effect of water on paper various investigators theorize that a deacidification solution containing organic solvents might provide a remedy for these water caused difficulties their line of thinking suggests that a remedy for the deacidification dilemma might be found by seeking the answers to three questions  are other chemicals known which have been used to promote the permanence of cellulosic fibers  are there chemicals which might be introduced into paper and therein allowed to react and form chemicals which are known to promote the permanence of paper  if such chemicals exist are there solvents available which do not have the undesirable properties of water conservators commonly use acetone benzene ethyl alcohol white gasoline hexane methyl alcohol naphtha pyridine toluene and trichlorethelene as cleaning solvents the problems which concern conservators who use organic solvents are related to inks or secondary paper making materials and not to the paper fiber itself see n  spinner  discusses brightness reversion for example yellowing of paper on aging jarrell et al  p  hansen  and barrow a p  langwell  pp   kathpalia  p  and barrow research laboratory  pp    additional questions which might suggest other approaches to paper deacidification or stabilization are  are there chemicals and processes known which could be combined to deacidify and stabilize paper effectively without the necessity of wetting the paper being treated this question asks if permanence might be improved when the deacidifying agent was introduced as a gas perhaps cyclohexylamine carbonate suggested in langwell  vapor phase deacidification process would be useful  are there deacidification or stabilization treatments known or possible which might be shown experimentally to promote the long term permanence of paper this query is related to question  text but differs in that the requirement for long term exposure of paper specification  to the deacidifying andor stabilizing agent is dropped some possibilities or springboards for further development are use of a soaps or alkaline earth tanates as implied by holden and maguire  b aromatic and aliphatic amines as per speel  p  c alkali metal borates and phosphates as reported by istrubtsina and pravilova  d polymers of cyanamides or their methyol compounds as suggested by sergeeva  e dicyanamides and dicyanoguanadines as invented by studney pollard and landes   f acid binding salts as invented by langwell  and g alkali salts of organic polyacids as eg sodium carboxymethylcellulose by raff herrick and adams  sinterview with paul n banks  asibid

paper deacidification  the treatment that is the ph values which are reported below should not be taken to indicate literally the ph value which would be obtained if a water extract were made the leaves of a  dutch imprint were cut apart and half of each leaf immersed for periods of approximately  seconds to eighty minutes in a solution containing  per cent magnesium acetate  per cent diethylene glycol  per cent water and  per cent ethyl alcohol the ph shift was from about  on the untreated sheets to about  or  on the treated sheets the time of immersion did not appear significant the diethylene glycol was included to act as a plasticizer no definite conclusion was reached as to whether it reduced paper brittleness the same solution was used to treat a variety of books selected from discards of the university of chicago library each book was split down the spine and one section totally immersed boards and all in the treatment solution for thirty minutes no effort was made to insure that all parts of the book would be wetted that is circulating the solution splaying the leaves or moving the book about the section was then removed and pressed by hand against a flat surface to squeeze out as much of the solution as possible the wet section was either  set on end with its leaves splayed or  laid on its side board down with every second or third signature turned over and tucked into the spine to facilitate airflow and then allowed to air dry overnight in each case the untreated section was retained to act as the control it took several days for the ph of the treated sections to stabilize due to the evolution of acetic acid the location of the ph test was at the center of a leaf in the middle of each section the ph shift depended upon the original ph of the paper in the book being treated averages were from a ph of  before treatment to a ph of  after treatment and similarly from  to  or  the spines and the boards were not tested but only checked to insure that they had been wetted these results were encouraging in that the acidity of the paper undergoing treatment was reduced it is my opinion that the treatment reached the innermost parts of the book the boards and leaves of the treated sections showed essentially no cockling or warping on drying the treated sections were entirely usable the ink and dyes from the type images of a few foreign imprints did bleed and run however these foreign imprints remained entirely legible although they were aesthetically unpleasant the dyes from the speckle fore edge and from the cloth bindings of a number of domestic and foreign imprints were leached sufficiently to color the treatment solution although this solution did darken the color tone of the leaves of these sections or those sections subsequently treated librarians who inspected the results judged the bluing in those cases to be inconsequential preliminary experiments with a  per cent by weight solution of magnesium methoxide solution in methyl alcohol were limited to treating single sheets the procedure was simple the test sheets were dipped into the solution moved about for a few seconds until wetted and then removed and hung up arrow research laboratory  p   the  per cent water derives from the water of crystallization of magnesium acetate tetrahydrate chcoomg   h the source of the  per cent magnesium acetate
 tihe library quarterly to dry the ph shift was from about  to  although more cockling occurred than with ethyl alcohol the amount of cockling was significantly less than when another sheet of this same paper was wet with water and dried it appears then that the use of aliphatic alcohols as the solvent for and carrier of a basic formate or an acetate or alkoxide may offer a practical deacidification treatment for paper it also seems likely that substantially greater quantities of these stabilizing agents may be introduced into paper because of their greater solubility in alcohol as contrasted to the solubility of conventional stabilizing agents calcium hydroxide calcium bicarbonate and magnesium bicarbonate in water it is my belief that some combination of these materials will provide at least one route toward a major breakthrough in the wet deacidification of single sheets it is too early to predict the ultimate outcome of this investigation with regard to treating books there are too many unsolved problems in efficiently treating a variable mass of leaves held immobile along one edge as in a book the goal of the proposed study is to set the stage for a mechanized pilot plant operation wherein whole books are deacidified some probability of success is indicated by  the latin american practice of thoroughly wetting whole books with gasoline and  the non aqueous deacidification treatment developed by baynes cope british museum research laboratory if this study does develop an efficient laboratory method of deacidifying whole books there will remain formidable problems in expanding these results to processing the quantity and variety of books in a research library on a production line basis proposed laboratory investigation the laboratory investigation in which the above treatments and perhaps others may be studied might be subdivided into three stages the initial set of experiments could evaluate the effect of different treatments upon several kinds of book papers the book papers themselves might be selected to act as constants with the treatments being evaluated as variables the second series of experiments could extend and support these initial results by evaluating effective treatments on book papers selected to represent the varieties of paper found in books in libraries in this series the treatments would be  in an interview with harold w tribolet october   he asserted the feasibility of treating books in organic solvents based upon the latin american practice of soaking books in gasoline to prevent insect and rodent attack paper when wet by hydrocarbon solvents like gasoline does not lose strength or expand the normal british museum practice is to use the barrow immersion process as their routine method of paper deacidification a d baynescope british museum research laboratory developed a non aqueous deacidification process for documents which cannot be treated with water the criteria for selection of paper for this special treatment are  the nature of the ink ie if the ink is likely to be susceptible to water damage and  the actual fragile nature of the paper ie if the paper would become dangerously weak if wetted by water the treatment solution is prepared by dissolving  gms of barium hydroxide octahydrate baoh   h in  ml of methyl alcohol to form a  per cent by weight volume solution of barium hydroxide baoh this deacidification solution is applied  by an immersion treatment or  by brushing or spraying when the paper is very fragile the treated document is hung for air drying so that any residue of barium hydroxide might react with carbon dioxide from the surrounding air to form barium carbonate sensible precautions should be taken in applying this process because  barium and most of its compounds are toxic  methyl alcohol fumes are both explosive and toxic and  many colored inks eg ballpoint pen inks are soluble in methyl alcohol werner 
paper deacidification  considered as constants and the papers as variables a final set of experiments might attempt to expand efficient treatments to the deacidification of whole books the utility of the deacidification treatments could be evaluated using the standardized tests established by the technical association of the pulp and paper industry or by more rigorous procedures designed by authorities on paper to improve the consistency of the tappi tests problems in deacidifying books certain problems in the wet deacidification of whole books and sometimes single sheets deserve further discussion although cellulose is a relatively inert material paper fibers are necessarily surface active such activity might adsorb some of the deacidification agent out of solution as the treatment is penetrating into a closed book or as the book is drying the deacidification agent might be carried out to the book surface and deposited near the point where the solvent evaporates it is evident that these actions must occur to some degree and to the extent that additional protection is required at the periphery of the book these actions are desirable how can the handling problems of impregnating and drying books be mechanized will vacuum processing techniques facilitate processing at ordinary temperatures or will it prove desirable to dry books using dielectric heating whereby the book can be warmed uniformly would a centrifuging stage provide assistance by reducing the amount of solvent to be removed by drying what methods of solution treatment will be desirable so that recycling as necessary in a continuous process can occur obviously filtering will remove particulate matter but what of the colorants leached from the book by the organic solvent would these dissolved materials be adsorbed by a surfaceactive filtrant or will another method such as distillation be indicated if a given treatment is applicable to a certain kind of paper or book or condition of paper or book will the treatment be applicable for all kinds of papers and books will formic and acetic acids completely volatilize out of the paper and are these acids and their parent compounds for example the alkali metal and alkaline earth formates and acetates benign to paper and book materials as some of the literature indicates what is likely to occur with different inks and their colorants and media fortunately most book printing inks utilize carbon black pigments and the boiled linseed or tung oil type media these materials tolerate both alcohols and shifts in ph range however the small quantities of blue black dyestuffs incorporated by present day practice into printing inks do bleed in alcohols the result technically speaking would be a grayer paper and a slightly browner type image actually the treated paper might appear whiter to the human eye because the dyestuff will tend to neutralize the yellowish hue of the paper the problem of colored illustrations is considerably more serious as a very great variety of dyes and pigments are used some dyes and pigments are understood to be unstable in alkaline conditions and they or other ink components might be soluble in alcohol although verification is necessary it is believed that most inks used in printing and illustrating books will tolerate the
 thie library quarterly sort of treatment this discussion has proposed the secondary paper making materials such as fillers starch coatings and alum resin size should not be detrimentally affected by this treatment likewise cotton and linen cords or cloth and boards which are cellulosic in nature and comparable to paper should not be affected animal glues and starch pastes should be unaffected however the pyroxylin clothbound books may create a problem the pyroxylin that is cellulose nitrate is soluble in alcohols it is probable that leather bookbindings should not be immersed into or wetted by the treatment solution because the alkaline solution might detan the leather and the alcoholic solvent might tend to dry and harden the binding some leather colorants are soluble in alcohol and could stain the book leaves it may be possible to evade this problem through a hand treatment for leather bound books the leaves could be immersed while holding the boards up out of the solution a special rack would be necessary to support the book and hold the boards away from the leaves during drying a conditioning treatment might be required to protect the flexibility of the book spine or hinges summary this paper has  superficially sketched the mechanism and effect of the acid catalyzed hydrolysis of cellulose on paper fibers  briefly reviewed current wet deacidification practices as an aid in suggesting desirable improvements in practice  introduced several new approaches to the problems of paper deacidification in books stored in libraries  described a few of the preliminary experiments indicating probable success of the proposed investigation  cited a number of problems on which more information is needed and  outlined a plan by which these ideas on paper deacidification could be investigated acknowledgmentsthis study was made possible through encouragement and guidance from the institute of paper chemistry appleton wisconsin and from the department of chemistry and the graduate library school university of chicago the author appreciates the assistance received from paul n banks conservator newberry library chicago forrest f carhart jr director library technology program american library association chicago and a e werner keeper british museum research laboratory london the author is particularly indebted to b l browning chairman organic chemistry section institute of paper chemistry appleton wisconsin marvin c rogers director chicago paper testing laboratory and executive director photoengraving research institute chicago leon stock department of chemistry university of chicago and harold w tribolet manager extra bindery r r donnelley and sons co chicago for background on the nature of cellulose paper and books thanks are also due to herman h fussler director university of chicago library george w troyan assistant district sales manager allied chemical corporation general chemical division chicago and james d innes assistant to the director of marketing stauffer chemical company new york city for gifts of books magnesium acetate and sodium and magnesium methylate methoxide rogers april   oddy
