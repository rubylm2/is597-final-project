during the progressive era in the united states roughly  murals created for the public sphere participated in a broad cultural construction of social cohesion and national identity and acted as an analgesic for neutralizing the striking heterogeneity that characterized america at the turn of the twentieth century as if to counteract the centrifugal forces of a radically diverse population and to diminish the impact of dislocations and transformations brought about by vigorous immigration industrialization the rise of corporate capitalism shifting roles of women economic instability urbanization and labor disputes among other things murals articulated an idealized view and were designed to give tangible form to such vaguely defined but profoundly resonant concepts as citizenship patriotism democracy progress nationalism and unity paralleling the progressive eras mandate for social reform optimistic belief in change through democratic cooperation and often soaring rhetoric of civic idealism murals from the period were considered as playwright and pageant organizer percy mackaye noted in  agents of civilization  although marked by profound and defining transformations the progressive era embraced the notion of what benedict anderson has called an imagined community in which racial cultural religious and ideological among other differences were neutralized and reconstructed as the very fabric in which american identity was woven  on a cultural level the assumption of an imagined community called for the construction of public memory that would diminish discordant interests of diverse social groups and unite them into a conceptually cohesive body politic whose devotion to nation would prevail over familial local regional ethnic or class concerns emphasizing national consolidation and social cohesion over pluralism and competing vernacular interests public performances of many kindsfrom international exhibitions to may day celebrations to mural cycleswere staged during the progressive era in which the topography and boundaries of public memory and the national body were inscribed and debated this essay examines two mural cycles at the library of congress the evolution of the book by john white alexander and the evolution of civilization by edwin blashfield as case studies of the public performance of this imagined community as a nexus of intersecting discourses and assumptions about labor masculinity progress and national identity as expressive of the ideals of the american renaissance that selfconfidently celebrated america as the rightful heir to the sum of human knowledge and accomplishments and as coordinates for critical debates about the nature and function of municipal art in america the male body was the subject of each cycle and addressed the idea of labor in transformative terms functioning as a stabilizing rather than disruptive force paralleling the pedagogic imperative of the national public libraryto transform to civilize to americanizethe male body served as the map upon which the trajectory of current assumptions anxieties and debates about national identity was inscribed it is not surprising that the library of congress would be defined by contemporary critic royal cortissoz as our national monument of art given the scale of the project its federal sponsorship its posture as a public library with access to all americans and its national profile  p  paralleling the assumption of the library of congress as not merely a building for housing books but a ritualistic center of civilization  p  and ascribing to the ideals of the american renaissance the grand and ambitious iconographic program celebrated western civilization and in particular the evolution of culture through knowledge as with other progressive era civic and reform initiatives that subscribed to evolutionary logic and social darwinian discourse to define the role of culture the public library movement of the late nineteenth century believed in the transformative power of education and its pedagogic function as a civilizing and nationalizing agent given the posture of the library of congress as both our national monument of art and our national libraryas a powerful cultural technology of nationing  p it is no wonder that the murals in general constituted monumental tableaux of the hierarchical and evolutionary progress of culture situating america as the true and rightful heir of the expansive sum of human knowledge moreover paralleling the educational and reform imperatives that defined the early decades of the public library movement the muralists at the library of congress ascribed to the pedagogical tenets of municipal art to enlighten educate and promote culture as a cohesive force edwin blashfield effectively summarized the striking parallel between the civilizing potential indeed obligation of municipal art and the contemporary public library movement when he declared public art is the greatest educational force in the world from the time the sun of history begins to throw its light on the progress of mans culture we know there have always been men who recognized this fact and made the artist a schoolmaster with the public building as his academy  p  john white alexanders selection of the theme the evolution of the book may have been inspired in part by its location in the east corridor of the first floor leading directly to the main reading room and as such its proximity to blashfields evolutionary cycle inside the rotunda books were of course the principal occupants of the national library and served as potent vehicles of transformation indeed one could imagine the parades of national readers who would walk through the east corridor and see the dress rehearsal as it were of the pageant of civilization and knowledge that awaited them in the main reading room and the subject of gutenbergs invention of the printing press the final lunette of alexanders sixpart series was a particularly apt one for a national library whose mission was to make knowledge widely accessible indeed the theme of alexanders cycle resonated with the ambitious iconographic program of the library of congress as a whole that celebrated the evolution of culture through knowledge more important alexander defined this evolution within the context of masculinity and labor and as such offered a prelude albeit on a modest scale to the far more ambitious performance of progress and civilization in blashfields mural in which the principal actor is the male laborerengineer america alexander imposes an evolutionary logic on the development of the printed book the trajectory of intellectual and cultural progress outlined in the six lunettesthe cairn oral tradition egyptian hieroglyphics picture writing the manuscript book and the printing pressis paralleled in the decorative disposition of the scenes themselves which grow increasingly complex threedimensional and filled with visual incident as they approach the pinnacle of accomplishment with gutenbergs invention of the printing press in the final lunette alexander eschewed allegory in his lunettes in favor of historical accuracy and narrative clarity paralleling the pictorial strategies he had developed as an illustrator in the s this illustrative approach may be attributed to alexanders lack of experience with mural painting the library of congress commission represented his first excursion into largescale municipal work contemporary chronicler of american mural painting pauline king drew a parallel between alexanders style and inexperience calling it a quite excusable limitation of a first endeavor  p  alexanders historical approach moreover was the one of the three different modes proposed by alexander that the library committee selected the other two modes were the ideal and the realistic  p  finally alexanders selection of both the subject and the historical approach may be attributed to the influence of the contemporaneous mural cycle by fernand cormon at the hôtel de ville paris one with which alexander was surely familiar the cairn located at the south end of the east corridor is the first lunette in alexanders series a group of men whose primitive nature is suggested by their animal skin loincloths and rugged features are assembling a mound of stones at the seashore the cairn may be a memorial of some kind or perhaps a geographical marker within the context of alexanders evolutionary narrative this crude monument created by a community of men imbues the geography with public meaning and marks a first step toward the creation of public knowledge and a vehicle for its dissemination in oral tradition a robed and hooded darkskinned storyteller stands before a semicircular group of seated men and gestures dramatically as he relates a tale the landscape rises beyond the group of seated men creating a visual barrier and suggesting an encampment however rudimentary the subject of this lunette parallels that of olin levi warners bronze tradition which is located on the north door of the librarys main entrance in which a seated mother and child are flanked by as thomas somma has noted representatives from four premodern races whose histories were maintained and disseminated through their oral traditions  p  a scaffold slung before the portal of an egyptian temple occupies the foreground of the third lunette egyptian hieroglyphics in the far distance is a single pyramid an egyptian workman is seated on the scaffold with his back to the viewer and is cutting a hieroglyphic inscription his muscular body is youthful and taut as he raises his hammer to the chisel seated beside him is a young woman nude as is the male worker except for a loincloth her gaze is not returned by the young man who is engaged in his labor this episode in evolution of the book is the first to feature written records in this case inscribed in a public space blashfields collar decoration likewise underscored egypts defining contribution of written records as the first of twelve figures in his mural cycle and strategically placed at the eastern cardinal point of the decorative cycle blashfields egypt is associated with written records in a more complex manner than is alexanders figure and geographically and symbolically locates the east as the cradle of civilization the former holds a tablet inscribed with hieroglyphics and is seated beside a case filled with papyrus manuscript rolls  p  moving to the north end of alexanders east corridor lunettes picture writing fig  employs a similar narrative strategy to the preceding one and features a young nude manhere a native americanseen from the rear engaged in the process of written expression the low bowl of red paint rests next to the smoothed animal hide on which he is painting a picture story reclining behind him is a nude young woman whose gaze is turned to the pictorial narrative in spite of the clear national resonance the subject of the native american was quite exceptional in the library of congress decorationsit appeared in warners bronze entry door panel tradition in which the native american was one of four premodern figures associated with oral traditionsperhaps due to the cosmopolitan orientation of the muralists and their selected themes in contrast to the thirtythree ethnological heads on the first story pavilion of the main facade which selfconsciously meld current ethnological assumptions with decorative considerations and which feature two native americansa pueblo and a plains indianalexanders native americans express the american renaissance assumption that modern civilized institutions are rooted in the cultures of aboriginal peoples and that the entire human family has contributed to the general progress of civilization  p  fig  john white alexander picture writing  oil on canvas one of six lunettes from the evolution of the book east corridor first floor library of congress washington dc courtesy of library of congress the manuscript book physically and ideologically moves alexanders evolutionary narrative from premodern contributionsthe nude native americans are embedded within a vaguely defined landscapeto the interior of a monastery cell where three monks are engaged in the illumination and examination of manuscript books in the foreground a young monk is seated beside a small window which provides light for the illumination of a page of a grand folio on which he labors two older men at the far rear of the darkened chamber examine a folio the movement of the folio quite literally from foreground to rear ground implies a hierarchy of labor and skill while proposing an enclosed finite arena within which the knowledge contained by the manuscripts can circulate the printing press fig  the final lunette in alexanders series can be read as both a quasirealistic depiction of gutenberg inspecting a proof sheet and as an allegory of labor in which alexander narrates work ethic assumptions of transformation and selfimprovement the three men who fill the workroom suggest upward mobility and progress in relation to work the youngest man to the right dressed in a workers apron labors at the press harnessing his physical vigor and strength to transform the vernacular into the cosmopolitan in service ultimately of public culture and education the slightly older worker to the left bowing in subservient expectation serves as the mediator between the physical laborer and the elderly gutenberg the latters clothing identifies him as the privileged elite whose labor is strictly cerebral and whose cultural hegemony is unquestioned gutenberg the inventor examines the proof sheet visually recalling evidence of his invention and underscoring his possession of literacy fig  john white alexander the printing press  oil on canvas one of six lunettes from the evolution of the book east corridor first floor library of congress washington dc courtesy of library of congress paralleling the assumptions of progressive era reformists and cultural philanthropists of all kinds alexanders cycle can be read as positing public culture as a tonic for social problems of all kinds and offering a case study of how exposure to western culture could serve as a selfregulating impetus to individual and civic improvement acquisition of english language skills and assimilation and as such function as a stabilizing force among the masses of immigrant laborers the mediating figure between the young pressman and the elderly gutenberg becomes the newly civilized reader through exposure to texts made accessible and meaningful to a broad public by gutenbergs invention much like the national readers who would assemble under blashfields collar decoration in the publics reading room in the words of librarian of congress a r spofford  p  of the library of congress to gain access the wealth of knowledge therein contained gutenbergs invention of the printing press transformed knowledge into a technology of social meaning and proposed a vital connection between knowledge progress and social evolution that the public library was originally conceived as a cultural institution for urban reform makes alexanders cycle all the more resonant with such progressiveera assumptions cultural historian alan trachtenberg has addressed the ameliorative function of cultural and reform enterprises at the turn of the twentieth century noting the prevailing assumption that culture could disarm potential revolution and embrace all classes  p  trachtenbergs observations parallel the words of selfstyled cultural and public library philanthropist andrew carnegie who noted in  the result of knowledge gleaned from libraries is to make men not violent revolutionaries but cautious evolutionists not destroyers but careful improvers  p  far more ambitious and complex an allegory of labor is edwin blashfields collar decoration for the main reading room the sheer scale of the decoration is matched by the iconographic ambition and ideological assumptions of the work the evolution of civilization fig  narrates the american renaissance ideal of america as the culmination of history and the heir of the sum total of human knowledge achievements and culture positioning america as the twelfth and final figure in this chronological and evolutionary trajectory of progress paralleling the mapping of civilizations march from east to west in the court of honor at the worlds columbian exposition in  blashfields figures assume an evolutionary logic and directional flow of civilization the first figure egypt is associated with the east america fig  the final figure is aligned with the west the decorative rhythm and continuity of motifs and poses throughout the collar decoration offer a striking visual continuity that reinforces the cycles narrative implication of the inevitability of progress fig  edwin blashfield the evolution of civilization  oil on canvas collar mural interior of dome reading room library of congress washington dc courtesy of library of congress fig  edwin blashfield detail america egypt judea from the evolution of civilization see fig  the alignment of america with progress and the west served as a virtual history lesson of the nineteenth century in which westward expansion and its simultaneous industrialization would have been readily understood as evidence of national progress and social evolution as historian david nye notes these narratives of evolution and progress were played out through sheer force of rugged individualsthe physical conquest of space as directed by men  p and the assumption of national exceptionality and inevitable advancement given that blashfields america was painted in an era of industrialization and pervasive technology when the autonomy of the individual was increasingly curtailed and the inevitability of expansion was circumscribed by the closing of the frontier this evolution of progress was as much concerned with the perpetuation of national myths as the declaration of america as the rightful heir to the promise of civilization if blashfields america placed at the western edge of human history and progress looked to the past for national memories and cosmopolitan validation it also glanced to the future of a nation poised to embark upon a geopolitical shift from continental expansion to overseas empire as if to relieve the deep anxieties due to the closing of the frontier the impending spanishamerican war and its promise of imperial expansion offered as historian amy kaplan argues a new frontier where the essential american man could be reconstituted  p  frederick jackson turner himself proposed overseas expansion as a solution to the problem of the west as he called it invoking bishop berkeleys oftenrepeated declaration westward the course of empire takes its wayof the s as a foundational staple of american selfconception by this time turner wrote for nearly threehundred years the dominant fact in american life has been expansion with the settlement of the pacific coast and the occupation of freelands this movement has come to a check that these energies of expansion will no longer operate would be a rash prediction and the demands of a vigorous foreign policy for an oceanic canal for a revival of our power upon the seas and for the extension of american influence to outlying islands and adjoining countries are indications that the movement will come  p  blashfields america then posits masculinity and by extension nationhood freed from national boundaries america as a nation is both embodied in the robust masculinity of america and disembodied as a winged figure with the promise of extracontinental territorial expansion although science is inscribed as the contribution of america the figure is dressed in workmans clothesthe garb of the machineshop according to chronicler of the library of congress herbert small  p and he sits with an electric dynamo between his legs he is brawny and muscular one whose physical prowess suggests power masculinity and as contemporary critic charles caffin noted the strenuous determination of the young giant america  p  at the same time the figure is transformed into an engineer his intellect is embedded in the book he grasps in one hand and alluded to by his posture of meditation as if lost in thought regarding the potential of technology represented by the dynamo this conflation of workerengineer acts as a visual performance of the transformative power of education and knowledgeworker becomes engineerand privileges technology as the source of and site for american progress and national identity moreover this liminal figure accommodates the physical prowess and strength of the worker with the intellect and abstract thinking of the engineer effectively stabilizing the potential conflict between the working and dominant classes given the  depression and the labor unrest of the past two decades blashfields america can be read as a soothing analgesic to assuage widespread fears of class warfare labor violence and economic collapse the progression from laborer to engineer may be understood as well within the evolutionary paradigm articulated by spencer in which culture functions as a civilizing agent the laborer is civilizededucatedand transformed into an engineer a modern hero whose rapport with technology and its assumed corollary of increasing efficiency ensure sustained progressive improvement and indeed unfettered optimism as cultural historian cecilia tichi argues the engineer is the representational man of the late nineteenth century a symbol of efficiency stability functionalism and power in the imaginative literature of industrialized america he figures as a new hero who enacts the values of civilization he is at once visionary and pragmatic  p  much as america the laborercumengineer civilizes the machine and offers an analgesic to assuage current uncertainties due to rapid change he functions as social engineer rehearsing the efficiency amelioration and stabilizing influence of social control as understood by the library movement and many progressive era reform initiatives at the turn of the twentieth century all national readers in the library of congress were encouraged effectively to become their own engineers and to redeem themselves as part of the national body and the new social order through personal and social transformation the library of congress artists themselves functioned as workerscumengineers whose artistic labors were transformed into publicly meaningful narratives of evolution and progress as contemporary critic william a coffin noted the artists like the workmen were in overalls and the atmosphere of the place seemed impregnated with the spirit of art and labor  p  artist and critic will low noted that it was only with the completion of the library of congress decorations that the american artist was finally accorded the status of the civil engineer and understood as a useful member of our social fabric  p  that the chief supervisor of decorations at the library of congress edward pearce casey was trained as a civil engineer and architect underscores the current conflation between public art pedagogy and national progress the dynamo itself functioned as a multivalent symbol representing american progress and technological ingenuity it was the literal engine of change that generated the industrial revolution of the late nineteenth century and it was the source of power for the electric lightssome  of them p  ventilating fans elevators and modern bookcarrying equipment that made the library of congress a model of efficiency and accessibility indeed the librarys emphasis on efficiency and accessibility paralleled both the conceptual shift in the late nineteenth century of the role of libraries from what john cole has called storehouses to workhouses and a technological utopia espoused by reformers who believed machines were humanitarian devices that would relieve the burdens of labor raise the standard of living for all and promote harmony between labor and capital effectively returning america to the imagined harmony of the preindustrial era indeed blashfields fusion of seemingly opposite visual codescontemporary subject matter the dynamo and the worker with principles of classical art evoking a timeless past the heroically scaled winged bodyconstructs a reassuring narrative of continuity with the past in a period of rapid social change removed from the exigencies of contemporary workers lives and the uncertainties of modernity blashfields winged america is both progressive and nostalgic in its social and aesthetic aims the wings fix the memory of the individual body into a collective timeless past endowing the figure with as art historian janet marstine has noted the moral weight of an ancient god  p  and serve as an antidote to the disruptive potential of the laboring body moreover based on the aesthetics of beauty order and harmony america embodies the cultural and reform agenda of the contemporary city beautiful movement that was designed to improve urban existence and thereby inculcate citizens and immigrants with moral values and civic pride  p  blashfields metanarrative of national progress reassures viewers of the efficacy of civic reformimmigrant laborer becomes patriotic member of the national bodyas it urges all citizens of america to complete the ritual of civilization through the process of selfregulation assimilation and desire for ascendancy blashfields america locates national progress and accomplishment within the contested sphere of masculinity during the decades that bracketed the turn of the twentieth century the definition of manhood experienced profound shifts in response to what was understood as threats to angloamerican male authority and power from among others the working class immigrants and freedomseeking women moreover neurasthenia the scourge of the civilized threatened to emasculate an entire generation of american men first identified in  by new york neurologist george beard neurasthenia was defined as a disease of the most evolved societiesthat is angloamericanwhose vast accumulation of wealth and privilege had stripped them of vital nerve force as beard called it  by the s such disruptive and diverse social phenomena as labor uprisings the precipitous decline of urban angloamerican birthrates in contrast to that of immigrants the seemingly increasing number of emasculated men and their dreaded counterpart masculinized women and the moral disintegration of the middle and upper classes were attributed in part to the degrading social effects of the disease as such blashfields manly yet contemplative america serves as both a model for a working class that is transformed and subdued by the work ethic and for the invigoration and masculinization of the embattled anglo elite within the context of the growing mistrust of the socalled feminization of american culture as discussed by historian t j jackson lears america offered a reassuring and clearcut definition of masculinity  p  moreover contemporary audiences would have readily understood americas physical strengthhis manlinessas expressive of his revitalized social authority rather than simply as his manual labor theodore roosevelts contemporaneous discourse of the strenuous life as he called it implicated masculinity and imperialism in the service of continued national progress and indeed the progress of civilization not unlike blashfields evolution of civilization cultural historian gail bederman notes as he roosevelt saw it the united states was engaged in a millennial drama of manly racial advancement in which american men enacted their superior manhood by asserting in imperialistic control over races of inferior manhood to prove their virility as a race and a nation american men needed to take up the strenuous life and strive to advance civilization through imperialistic warfare and racial violence if necessary  p  only two years after blashfield completed his evolution of civilization roosevelt and his entourage of rough riders carried out an assault on san juan hill in cuba driven by the tripartite alignment of nationalism imperialism and manliness considered within a pedagogic context blashfields evolution of civilization in general and america in particular can be read as a visual lesson in assimilation and as a pictorial paean to the socalled melting pot theory resonating with contemporary assumptions about immigration and its impact on american national identity america embodies the classical paradigm of assimilation that proposed a linear trajectory along which pluralistic immigrant culture and ethnic identitythat is the eleven epochs andor nations that precede america in this evolutionary paradigmare profoundly transformed  what was a polyglot assemblage of immigrants with sundry local identities become a unified national body of american citizens who share a cohesive memory and a homogenous system of cultural and social practices and values that this system was articulated by and constructed to validate and protect dominant angloamerican norms went without saying the issue of national identity and the role of public art in its articulation dominated critical discussions of the murals at the library of congress although the valuation of american arts cosmopolitanism ranged widely blashfield spoke for his generation of europeantrained artists who defined nationalism within a cosmopolitan and historical context although the underlying issue of national expression in american art remained a primary concern the concept of an art free from the taint of european influence was irrelevant if not meaningless indeed following blashfields argument american arts very universality which by definition denied any local grammar or topical reference was unquestionable testimony of americas national achievements cosmopolitan profile and confirmation of its cultural coming of age  blashfields the evolution of civilization is an example of his adept mingling of allegory and realismin his words the modern and american  p while locating and legitimizing americas contributions within the international evolutionary flow of culture kenyon coxs activities as a muralist and writer were second only to blashfields in the s and the turn of the twentieth century central to coxs critical agenda and pictorial practice was the adherence to tradition and the classic spirit as he called it which emphasized permanence continuity selfcontrol and the search for the essential and eternal rather than the transient as a critic cox gave high praise to the library of congress muralistsblashfield vedder and himself among otherswho depicted lofty and distinctly atemporal subjects unentangled by nationalist rhetoric by contrast he rejected the treatment of historically specific and nationally relevant themes as at best parochial and imperfectly decorative cox concluded unfortunately our history is short our modern costumes formless and ugly and american historical subjects particularly unfitted for pictorial treatment  true monumental decoration  is always symbolical rather than real in its treatment of history  p  nationalist discourse defined the series of articles on the decorative work in progress at the library of congress for harpers weekly by young draftsman turned art critic royal cortissoz guided by the assumption that the library of congress represented a national undertaking and stood at the very core of our national life  cortissoz argued that the buildings greatest asset was its demonstration of the fertile relationship between artistic work and civic and national progress  p  unlike muralistcritic will low who characterized the cosmopolitan nature of the library of congress murals as devoid of national expression  p  cortissoz found the librarys decorative cycles a nationalist tonic in the evolution of american art he argued the american school of mural decoration  is still in process of formation yet more than in any other form of art we have escaped the trammels of convention we have developed our own ideas without that constant allusion to alien examples which have so often vitiated our painters of easel pictures from the start there seems to have been a healthy refusal to meddle with old precedents  p  cortissozs celebratory discourse of american arts vigor and healthy progress as testified by the muralists at the library of congress has striking parallels to roosevelts invocation of millennial drama with the spanishamerican war indeed cortissoz concluded that the library of congress opens auspiciously as the century comes to a close and it promises immeasurable progress for when art takes hold of public buildings it enters into the very lifeblood of the nation  would the result seem very unlike the millennium itself  p  other critics likewise invoked the rhetoric of the march of progress in their discussions including william a coffin who insisted that the vitality of library of congress decorations step in the onward march of art in the united states must be conceded without discussion  p  charles caffin shared with cortissoz the assumption of national relevance in municipal art and argued that the intelligent mingling of allegory and historical specificity would invigorate american mural painting and distinguish it as monumental national and democratic looking back at the decorations at the library of congress a decade after their completion caffin found much to praise and condemn  p  he concluded that the library of congress represented an auspicious opportunity for the articulation of a distinctly american school of mural painting but that regrettably few of the artists had risen to the opportunity resorting instead to an allegorical style that eschewed national identity and the realities of modern life what was mild disdain on the part of caffin became virulent rejection on the part of charles m shean of the national society of mural painters in reviewing the progress of american mural painting from the s to the turn of the century shean regretted both the general lack of monumental decoration in public buildings throughout the united states and when present its failure to find inspiration in american themes endeavors and achievements insisting on mural paintings public and therefore democratic nature shean bluntly dismissed the validity of allegorical contrivances whose subject matter and significance was neither contemporary nor widely accessible and he urged muralists to seek inspiration in the history and tradition of their own land  moreover shean bitterly regretted the lost opportunity to articulate an american iconography at the library of congress and could not forgive its foreign accent and its unwillingness to serve as an incentive to patriotism  p  critic ada cone likewise found american muralists foreign accent regrettable and argued our art to be truly ours to be truly great must be born out of the labor of the people  p  the library of congress muralsin particular the cycles by blashfield and alexanderand the critical discussion they engendered were positioned within and mediated by contested contemporary debates regarding national identity progress labor and masculinity both artists assumed knowledge progress and civilization to be evolutionary and used the male body as a scaffolding to sustain and stabilize these conflicting discourses through a focused attention on the body of laboring men these murals invoked gendered discourse of physical and national fitness the frontier and labor and were designed pedagogically to serve as models to improve urban existence and to inculcate citizens and immigrants with national values and civic pride in short to act as agents of civilization library of congress muralists and critics alike participated in the construction of public memory and a common meaningan imagined communitythat could fix the precariously unstable boundaries of the national body at the turn of the twentieth century and provide rich evidence of the compelling and contested relationship between municipal art and national life   gutenberg appeared
