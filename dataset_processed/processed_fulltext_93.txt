readjustments by the librarian herman h fussler in this paper an effort wil be made to try to relate some of the current concerns and operating problems of the larger research library to aspects of the basic intellectual world of which the library is a part in approaching this task we shall try to emphasize some of those situations that now seem likely to require major attention or solution in the next ten to twenty years the librarian is accustomed to trying to peer into the future in order to provide the kinds of materials that he thinks or hopes will be needed he also tries to look backward to evaluate and account for elements of strength and weakness in his collections and what sometimes appear to be the successes and the errors of his predecessors let us begin with a very brief examination of one or two general aspects of the scholarly library it is not an institution of marked fluidity it cannot overnight mobilize great strength in a subject or a particular form of literature barring a fortunate block purchase this usually takes time more time than it should perhaps and in the future possibly less time than we now like to think is necessary but it takes time nonetheless the library and scholarly methods of organizing the matenral at hand are increasingly baffling in their complexity and cost yet very little concrete information is available on the effectiveness of these organizational devices the use of a scholarly library would present an alarming picture to any modern industrialist in his terms the investment in the inventory is fantastically high yet only a very small proportion of the inventory is in use at any one time and much of the more expensive and perhaps most valuable parts of the inventory are never or almost never used on the basis of conventional industrial economics such an organization should long since have been dedared bankrupt and liquidated or completely reorganized under more enlightened management yet scholarly libraries are economically poor and relative to most trends they are becoming poorer rather than richer despite the fact that in the light of the concepts by which they operate they are not inefficient the situation faced by the modem research library is so complex that to hazard a relatively brief discussion of its problems inevitably risks fairly detailed treatment of only one or two more obvious matters or superficial discussion of a larger area of the obvious it will be the major theme of this paper that many though not all of the principal current problems of the scholarly library go back in one way or another to the growth of knowledge and the mediums of communication interestingly enough this preoccupation is not a new one for librarians the intellectuals of ancient rome were worried about it too while the basic problem may not be new the problem has new dimensions that require us to reconsider the nature of the scholarly library and its methods of operation this in turn requires that we also consider the needs and methods of the present and 
readjustments by the librarian  future scholars who depend upon the library in this discussion i shall try merely to outline some of the problems with here and there an indication of the direction solutions may take rather than attempt to descnrbe the solutions themselves it is important that we recognize in this context that the librarian is not a completely free agent he can adjust and readjust as the title of this paper implies but only within real and sometimes quite narrow limits the need for readjustment as well as the nature of the readjustments has its origins in factors of greater generality than those controlled by the librarian alone while the librarian undoubtedly needs readjustment from time to time like a fine watch the library which he administers and the constituency which he serves may also be in occasional need of readjustment either the ideal or the actual scholarly library is affected by four different kinds of influences first it is affected by the desires needs and customs of society and particularly of that part of society which forms the library constituency second the resources of the library in money and manpower and manpower must include capability as well as quantity have a major bearing upon operations third the extent and basic characteristics of the materials from which libraries assemble their collections are very critical factors finally the state of our knowledge or of our understanding of the operations of libraries and the needs of readers must certainly influence our behavior and our operations an initial consideration of the kinds of readjustments to which librarians are likely to be subjected reveals that the factors listed above are not convenient rubrics for the discussion of change or readjustment primarily because many of the probable changes or readjustments are related to more than one factor since the four pnrncipal forces which affect scholarly libraries are not convenient devices under which to organize a discussion i submit the following six major categories under which readjustments might with reasonable convenience be discussed  the state of our basic knowledge of libraries and the library profession  characteristics of print and scholarship  co operation among libraries and librarians  financial problems  problems of personnel and staffing and  machines and technological developments there is only a vague element of cohesiveness among these topics and many others could be added to the list the justification of this list grows essentially out of the existence of major contemporary problems in these areas and out of contemporary problems change is most likely to arise basic knowledge we may dispose of our first major category that of the basic knowledge of libraries and the library profession vety quickly by saying that the scholarly library has almost no basic principles or basic knowledge on which to operate the deficiency in this area is fundamental and critical if we are to plan sensibly for the future the research library has been built largely upon a tradition of librarianship and scholarship that has many of its origins far in the past as librarians we do not know nearly enough about the devices by which scholars are led to particular forms of print or from one area of print to another the uses which they actually make of print or libraries and their actual needs for books and print we know for example that the demands of scholarship are extremely broad we sense that librarians may tend
 the library quarterly to define scholarly demands as being broader than they actually are but they are urged to this course by scholars themselves it is said for example that scholarship has no limits in its need or potential future need for print and therefore libraries taken collectively may have no limits either as i shall try to show in later sections of this paper the sound operation of scholarly libraries may be jeopardized if this premise is correct and we lack convincing evidence that it is correct the underlying question is whether the traditions of scholarly librarianship will support and sustain its future operations successfully change if change is to come ought to be based upon a genuine understanding of the fundamental processes and principles that are involved in the absence of such knowledge change may be imposed through economic or intellectual collapse and may be anything but constructive in nature we would hope therefore that in the next ten to twenty years major research efforts could be directed toward an improved understanding of the processes of communication in scholarship only from such studies may the scholarly library successfully and soundly plot its future operations and development characteristics of print and scholarship under our second topic characteristics of print and scholarship we have loosely associated a series of partially related matters to the extent that there are general empirical concepts underlying the scholarly library these have most of the virtues of age some of them certainly go back to the medieval university yet there are fundamental differences in the situation of the scholarly library today from that of its predecessors of only a few generations ago and the virtues of age may not be far from the discouragements of senility the medieval scholarly libraries were principally devoted to theology and the humanities the literature of the physical biological and especially the social sciences with the exception of certain professional literatures is a recent almost a contemporary phenomenon the medieval users of print were an elite the problems of communication among scholars were elementary and perhaps not even very important production of new texts was infrequent by any comparative standard at least and as a consequence the growth of literature has not been a serious factor until recent times the major physical growth in scholarly libraries in this country has occurred within one century and the bulk of that growth has been contained within the last fifty years in contrast to its predecessors the future scholarly library will be confronted with a situation of entirely different magnitudes it is widely recognized that knowledge is growing along roughly exponential lines and barring a major cataclysm will probably continue to do so for some time to come the growth of knowledge is probably reflected in an even greater growth of print since print has become a common device for facilitating all sorts of communication and record keeping and no one would now seriously assert that all printed matterwith print broadly interpreted to include manuscripts near print etcrepresents contributions to knowledge intellectual experience or even necessary reflections of our time the growth in the number of users of scholarly print has been substantial and is likely to continue not only have the users increased quantitatively but they have increased the difficulty
readjustments by the librarian  and the scope of their demands and the complexity in the patterns of their uses of print all these closely interrelated factors present the general scholarly library with serious and fundamental difficulties in maintaining its traditions of autonomous coverage and organization of material it has become apparent to some librarians that they can no longer expect to retain general coverage of print and near print materials in any substantial number of scholarly fields along the lines of traditional concepts when coverage must be based upon an enormously expanded outflow of print from an enormously complex variety of sources even if the librarians were able to maintain comprehensiveness in broad subject coverage there are questions as to whether they could organize the material along traditional lines and still have it useful it has been apparent for some time to the librarian and is becoming apparent to many scholars that the use of this enormously increased mass of materials is presenting its own special array of difficulties in indexing listing subject dassifying cataloging in short in the entire field of bibliographical organization which presupposes subsequent constructive scholarly use one may ask whether the resources of existing libraries inadequate as librarians know them to be are being utilized effectively by scholars as librarians we know how inadequate our bibliographical organization is and we have a fair impression of the inadequacies of our coverage we also know of the enormous diversification in the value and importance of different kinds of pnrnt from an increasing variety of sources scholars are more and more frequently recognizing these problems of use in i think at least three different directions the first direction is that of staying reasonably abreast and aware of current information and work in a field i have the general impression that as yet most scholars are not as seriously alarmed about this aspect of their literature as are librarians the second problem of scholarship is that of identifying and securing access to the body of literature both current and retrospective related to any particular topic here both scholars and librarians are increasingly concerned and aware of the major obstacles to efficient operations the third problem is that of scholarly digestion and use of literature after it has been identified and access secured this today is almost exclusively the concern of the scholar but scholars are beginning to worry more and more about the difficulty of handling this task well in the time available to them the current aspect of all these things that i have been describing when taken together seems to me to require a basic shift in the orientation of the scholarly library in part this shift is one of outlook and philosophy and may not initially be apparent in the day to day operations of the library it would require a shift away from an exclusive preoccupation with the building organization and servicing of a series of autonomous book collections each as comprehensive as possible to a preoccupation with one or more fields of knowledge in their entirety recognizing at the outset that a particular library resources with respect to most fields of knowledge will usually be incomplete to put this latter point bluntly i am not convinced that scholarship either requires or can afford exhaustive or inclusive coverage of all the world literature either in one library or in the libraries of this country taken as a whole i am sure that we need the best of the world literature that much of this
 the library quarterly will have to be distributed among a series of libraries and that only in some fields usually sharply defined will particular libraries want and scholarship require substantially all the literature that exists on a particular topic this view is contrary to another rather widely held attitude which admits that it is now possible that no one library can indusively cover more than a few subject areas but proposes for the libranres of the country the goal of comprehensive inclusive coverage of domestic and foreign publications of all kinds including the purely local and mediocre i am inclined to question our ability to attain such a goal and the necessity for doing so i believe that the goal we seek may be attained only if we are prepared to recognize the need for high standards in the selection of materials acting collectively as well as individually the underlying premise here is that scholarship now and in the future does not require access to more than a fraction of the total output of print that as time goes on this fraction may be a diminishing one and that the fraction now being collected may be inadequate but how seriously inadequate is not known this premise requires the most careful and critical examination if we are to build up and maintain useful research libraries finer appraisals on the part of both librarians and scholars of what is really required are essential if we are to avoid the inconclusive dissipation of our limited resources i take it that the major objective of the scholarly library is to secure organize and service for a scholarly constituency however defined the materials really required for scholarly study and investigation the question before librarians and scholars is whether or not the traditional methods of scholarly library collecting organizing and servicing provide the necessary facilities in the most efficient way considering the resources of the scholarly world as a whole the needs of the scholarly world and the needs of individual scholars and institutions money and time are relevant coordinates in all these matters one of the great difficulties of course of scholarly libraries is that they can appraise the value of their services only very approximately just as scholars can appraise the value of research and investigation only intangibly the final outcome of exploration in these fields would seem to me still obscure but it is my feeling that libraries inevitably must not only become more selective in their acquisition policies than they are now the libraries parent institutions may also have to become increasingly critical of certain kinds of scholarship and of the geographical distribution of certain kinds of scholarship library resources may force institutions to undertake research only where the institution can in a meaningful sense afford the facilities for that kind of research for libraries in the national interest are going to have to increase the specialization in their collections scholars will thus find it necessary to describe in rather specific terms what their goals are or ought to be with reference to acquisition and library service in particular fields and scholars thus far have been reluctant to do this out of more rigid selection co operative acquisition regional deposit libraries for less used materials and related developments one might hope that individual scholarly libraries could in the future more nearly stabilize their size there must be for a particular point in time and a particular institution an optimum size of collection if one goes beyond this optimum size the institution supporting
readjustments by the librarian  the library is diverting a higher proportion than necessary of its resources into library support as against other and more direct scholarly enterprises if the library is too small the resulting limitations upon the scholarship of the institution represent a waste of its resources because of the inadequate facilities the difficulty of course with setting up a limitation on the size of a particular library is that as long as knowledge is still increasing the literature reflecting the increase of knowledge will in turn expand as a consequence storage libraries specialized acquisition among libraries and even microprint and microfilm may not completely stabilize the size of the library yet within broad and perhaps gradually shifting limits the setting of optimum sizes may be possible the librarian of harvard has said that his library is too large for the current needs of harvard many other university libraries are clearly too small can the definitions for a mean be found if the book resources of individual institutions become more limited in relation to the totality of print as now seems likely the importance of bibliography in a variety of forms wil increase since elaborate institutionalized bibliography which is extremely expensive is also likely to be curtailed the development of good international national form and subject bibliography must be encouraged bibliographical facilities need to be sufficiently complete for scholarship to learn of relevant literature so that adequate decisions as to its usefulness may be made and to provide for its quick and efficient location for scholars wherever they may be libraries and scholars must look more critically at the facilities and controlling factors governing communication among scholars the question of whether for example the scholarly journal is not technologically obsolete is only one of many similar important problems while most scholars and virtually all journal editors will today dismiss the idea as pure fantasy there is an increasing body of evidence pointing toward the inefficiency of the scholarly journal as a device for the current communication of scholarly information and its permanent recording in libraries the direct distribution of individual scholarly papers accompanied by a self organizing bibliographical apparatus has been suggested as a possible step forward in the communication of current information especially in technology and the natural sciences this so called self organization of current literature with direct distribution to scholars independently of libraries or journals is already occurring on a limited scale for example with government distribution to investigators of much of the classified and unclassified literature associated with government research contracts with greatly improved bibliographical apparatus and distributive mechanisms it offers a pattern that is capable of application to other subject areas and kinds of scholarship possibly with important benefits to the efficiency of scholarly and library processes without a bibliographical organization of such material as an integral part of the plan such distribution of knowledge tends toward chaos rather than simplification finally perhaps a word should be said about the variety in the forms of material which scholarly libraries must in the future obtain we need only to recognize that printed books in stiff covers no longer constitute adequate collections for research nor have they for many years while the traditional library has been designed around the printed book in stiff

readjustments by the librarian  the major scholarly libranres of this country the farmington plan is devoted to the co operative acquisition of certain foreign publications there are a number of interesting even critical questions with reference to this plan one relates to whether coverage of the plan will remain consistent with the coverage needs of the co operating institutions if the plan results in obtaining substantial amounts of marginal material over and beyond the needs of the majority of co operating institutions it unquestionably will be in jeopardy of failure on the other hand if through the plan adequate coverage is not attained it may fail even more quickly as a consequence a very delicate balance must be maintained in such endeavors which will reflect not only the assumed needs of the co operating institutions but as time goes on an increasingly precise and accurate reflection of the real needs of scholarship other aspects of scholarly library cooperation are so widely known as to require little or no discussion in this paper the emergence of the regional storage library the reliance upon cataloging by the library of congress and so forth have been widely treated in the professional literature of librarianship and we shall not discuss them further except to predict the future extension of such activities financial support since the financial support of scholarly libranres is the subject of a separate paper in this conference we shall touch only upon one or two aspects of this extremely important matter the resources devoted to scholarly libraries in this country are minuscule in relation to the expenditures for horse race betting tobacco television sets or alcoholic beverages library expenditures are larger than they were ten or fifteen years ago but in relation to increased costs needs and the expenditures of the parent institutions library costs remain modest the financal resources of the scholarly library have never been adequate it is unlikely that if librarians remain reasonably alert they ever will be yet at the moment there appears little probability of a vast increase in the funds available for scholarly libraries we should particularly note the position at the present time of many of the scholarly libraries of privately supported institutions the purchasing value of endowment income has so greatly diminished in recent years as to present senrous financial problems to the endowed institutions this matter is important for the private institutions have been the pioneers in the bulding up of most of the great scholarly libraries of the country the libraries of harvard yale columbia the university of chicago the reference department of the new york public library and so forth have all been created with private funds gifts and bequests the possibilities of income for private institutions from a few individuals of great wealth seem to be vanishing except in texas many private institutions are broadening the public base of support and are already only quasiprivate but it has not yet been demonstrated that the public is willing to take over all of this burden business and industrial organizations are also assisting in the support of independent teaching and research despite such efforts the current growth in size and resources of the tax supported libraries of the state universities and of the federal government leads to the condusion that they are likely to supplant in considerable measure in the next generation or two the pre eminent position in size and gross
 the library quarterly support heretofore held by the libraries of the great private institutions this shift in gross support and gross size is not necessarily altogether bad for the private institutions for excellence depends as it always has on what goes to make up the bulk if the private institutions can find the financial resources and sound intellectual bases for the careful and selective building of good research collections and can rely upon the resources of the tax supported libraries for much of the modern ephemera and marginalia which are expensive to organize house and preserve they may suffer no real loss in scholarly efficiency and may actually gain both the public and the private library must look in the future as they have in the past to the support of individual book collectors and other interested persons for rare books manuscripts distinguished special collections and most particularly for the endowed funds to collect intensively in restricted fields from a general point of view the absence of a balance sheetwhich will reflect the efficiency of a library operations may shield and protect the library for some time to come under these conditions it is important that librarians recognize that the investment in the acquisition organization and storage of relatively unused materials represents the major costs of the scholarly library alternative solutions which would make such material available with greater efficiency and with less cost require careful consideration and exploration librarians are already aware that the investment in duplicate cataloging operations in a large number of institutions represents a major waste of potential resources and will almost certainly be able in the future to reduce such operations even further than they already have now i do not wish to imply for an instant that the scholarly library can or should try to apply conventional business economics to its operations i do believe however that the scholarly library cannot be indifferent to efficiency in its operations in general the library lacks and should construct reasonable standards of such efficiency always relating them to the ends to be served standards of efficiency that are not so related are meaningless it is here that the difficulty arises for in business the general end to be served is that of making a monetary profit the scholarly library serves ends much more difficult to evaluate and criteria other than money are essential personnel and staffing the training qualifications status and aspirations of library personnel cannot help influencing the future change and development of the scholarly library the librarians in the scholarly library until only a few generations ago occupied relatively unimportant posts the librarians were usually custodians sometimes they were in addition scholars occasionally of great distinction the library was a quiet place in which to pursue an investigation relatively free of interruptions and distractions the stipend was modest but so were the duties this situation has now changed at least the duties have there is still a partially nostalgic desire for scholarly librarians to be if not scholarly at least what we have loosely come to call bookmen i am not always sure of the precise definition of a bookman in this context but i am sure that scholarly libraries require personnel who have a great variety of capabilities some of which at least are not commonly thought of as the general attributes of
readjustments by the librarian  a bookman library staff members certainly must have a svmpathy for books they must know a good deal about them the more the better they must know and understand the methods and purposes of a variety of kinds of scholarly research and investigation and the literature of these disciplines that they should also know something of management finance personnel bibliography the purposes and methods of teaching and the internal technical processes of libraries may surprise the scholars but not the librarians there may be a question at the present time as to whether enough good people are being recruited for librarianship are we able to attract personnel with sufficient intellectual attainments with the imagination the vigor and the subject backgrounds necessary for the proper advancement of the scholarly library now and in the future this is a matter that is partly associated with the construction of library school curriculums and the time when one commonly elects to enter the profession of librarianship the profession is at best emerging and still lacks prestige and a subject content akin to that of law medicine or engineering the recruitment of the best possible people is as critical a matter to the health and vigor of the library profession as it is for any other profession it is perfectly obvious that if we are to recruit the best people we must educate them efficiently for the tasks to which they will go and we must be sure that the tasks to which they go in libranres are so organized as to utilize their intellectual and professional abilities it is my feeling that in the future the scholarly libraries will require a greater number of skilled subject specialists on their staffs able and skilled subject specialists will i believe if they have attained the master or doctorate level in a subject discipline be impatient with much of the traditional training of the library schools and perhaps with cause it may be that the library schools will have to recognize sharper distinctions in the kind of training to be offered to different kinds of prospective personnel for the scholarly libraries the profession if it is to meet the demands upon it in the future must provide a variety of responsible wellpaying specialized positions outside the field of general administration to which competent people may aspire as permanent careers thus far the number of such positions is far too small and the attractions of general administration are thus falsely enhanced machines and technology we turn our attention now to the place of machines and technological development in the library of the future the most obvious requirement along these lines seems to us to be an adequate communication network for handling the very rapid transmission of large quantities of textual materials from one library to another thus it should be possible for a reader in texas to secure from a library in chicago the complete copy of a book periodical article or a series of newspaper pages in a matter of a few minutes and at a very low cost such a rapid communication system would have a sharp impact upon the economics of publishing and the antiquanran book market and its relationship to copyright is obscure but these difficulties should not blind us to the advantages of such a network that such technical possibilities are on the horizon is altogether evident a few years ago a transmission system referred to as ultrafax conferred even greater distinction upon the complete text of gone with the wind by transmitting it
 the library quarterly from washington to new york within a few minutes the atomic energy commission at oak ridge has now installed a facsimile system for transmitting periodical articles from a central library to various laboratory installations a number of miles away ultrafax required that the text to be sent be first reduced to microfilm form the aec method is still relatively slow requiring about one minute to scan a conventional journal page such slow transmission cannot meet our longrange needs and probably preliminary conversion into microfilm is not a satisfactory technical prospect what is required here is a machine with a reliable automatic page turner which would transmit hundreds of pages perhaps in a few minutes while such innovations may have a welisian sound the technical knowledge is largely available the difficulty of course is that knowledge of how to accomplish an end does not mean that the end can be attained in common practice the cost may be too great or the need may be exaggerated or the technique may be too imperfect yet widespread quick and easy access to books is badly needed and would if attained have a profound effect upon our acquisition policies the communication network would also provide facilities for assistance in the location and identification of textual materials so that a scholar might readily learn of the existence of particular works anywhere in the country and secure them promptly and easily even more intriguing but probably more remote is the possibility of continuous access to a master union catalog of some sort which would be continuously monitored with the results of the monitoring transmitted by some sort of network to at least the major research libraries of the country a sufficiently good system of monitoring might even make it possible for such libranres to discontinue the maintenance of parts of their own elaborate catalogs while this is all quite nebulous note that there is a growing amount of transmission of facsimile information throughout the country for commercial purposes that utility companies are maintaining continuous radio networks simply for the purpose of locating power line breaks instantly and automatically that there are continuous broadcasts of time and almost continuous broadcasts of weather information the library literature has made it abundantly clear that machines for storing information and for selecting information are on the nearer honrzon of the library and the intellectual world a machine which is capable of housing the present library of congress catalog in roughly two and one half cubic feet and which can sort and analyze bibliographical material in some considerable detail and reproduce copies of desired items has been constructed and is operating it is unreasonable to assume that the devices embodied in this instrument the shaw rapid selector have reached a final stage of perfection and that machines cannot be more extensively applied to the bibliographical problems of libraries at the same time we should not for the moment at least abandon our card catalogs for they are not altogether inefficient particularly for the location of single works by known authors nor can we ignore the obvious fact that one can extract from a bibliographical machine only what has been put into it and putting information into a machine is still a slow and difficult intellectual process for many of the recording searching and repetitive jobs of libraries mechanization seems to promise a great deal once we ascertain how to mechanize the
readjustments by the librarian  compilation of catalogs and lists the recording of serials and so forth are operations involving enormous amounts of detailed record keeping much of it repetitive which are cumbersome and expensive the application of punch cards and other machine techniques to these necessary and essential recording operations seems imminent and highly desirable they will extend the possible bibliographical operations of libraries and scholarship widely once we find ourselves able to handle the material caution must again be urged however the existence of interesting machines is not sufficient to justify their use a job must need doing it must be of a nature to require machine operation and there must be a machine appropriate for the job scholarly libraries and scholars must accustom themselves to the handling of textual materials which require some sort of machine or projector for consultation we have become modestly familiar with this in microfilm microcard and microprint and we should anticipate a further extension of microtechniques in the preservation and dissemination of textual materials these activities may well include the initial and only distribution of increasing amounts of scholarly information the high costs of conventional scholarly publishing are eliminating increasing quantities of material of importance for which there is only a limited audience conversion of such matenral into microcard microfilm microprint or variants yet to be seen offers the prospects of reasonably efficient distribution once we overcome our prejudices against these kinds of devices and their continuing technical limitations microfilm and microcards are still imperfect for the needs of institutions as well as individuals microfilm in flat sheets for certain applications is an emerging technical possibility a variant of this strip microfilm mounted in transparent envelopesis being actively explored at present we must not try to channel all forms of photographic or textual reproduction in microsizes into one particular format the variety of demands requires a diversity and flexibility greater than that offered by any one technique now in use perhaps this is an appropriate time to point out that we are exploiting these newer techniques thus far in a very limited and traditional manner they already offer more than we have accepted for example considerable sums of money have been devoted to the microfilm copying of long runs of material in one library in order to have the microfilm or a copy of it in a neighboring library much of this material is very rarely used and some may never be consulted thus one of the great advantages offered by microfilm that of ordering copies tailored to meet an actual definite need has been lost microfilm teletype and possible future facsimile transmission offer us the opportunity of using one another resources to meet some needs as they arise rather than endeavoring to anticipate all needs in advance we must find ways of capitalizing upon such techniques where we can that these procedures would affect scholarly habits cannot be denied but that scholarly habits are now all correct efficient and immutable requires more convincing proof than it has had one of the most promising of the newer photographic techniques on the horizon is very high speed lost cost reproduction in either full or reduced sizes if the scholarly reference and university libraries for example found it possible to copy in microfilm or some other form texts and especially periodical artides in a matter of a few minutes or seconds and hand the copy in a form convenient
 the library quarterly to use to the scholar in lieu of circulation of the original it would make a very great contribution to the efficiency of scholarly research and would greatly increase the accessibility of library materials such technical possibilities are again within sight if not yet in practice sumary in summary what differences will one see in the library or in the librarian ten or twenty years hence the importance of teaching research study and investigation of sound wellsupported and well managed scholarly libraries will be far more widely understood the bases of support for libraries will be broadened but we are unlikely to be rich or perhaps even well supported the role of the library as an auxiliary to teaching research and study will continue to be complex it is likely that some officers and faculty members of institutions of higher education will still not have a thorough grasp of the relation of the library to the objectives of the university the bases for collecting research materials will have undergone perceptible change there will be greater access to general collections but the competition between and duplication of efforts among contemporary libraries for rare and recondite materials of lesser value for current investigations will be diminished by co operative acquisition and related measures in a variety of directions together with greatly improved co operative access to materials wherever held the participation of the state the federal government and business and industry both directly and indirectly in building scholarly libraries will be conspicuous the library will continue to be subject to local needs and pressures but much of the day to day responsibility or initiative for building collections will have shifted from members of faculties in academic institutions to competent members of the library staff who will be able to devote to this task the time it requires time which faculty members are increasingly reluctant to give the faculty advice in universities will continue to be vital but much of the detail will shift to the library librarians will continue to increase their services to investigators and scholars and if the bibliographical organization of literature continues to increase in complexity will become indispensable to scholars in aiding them in finding needed information or literature acquisitions are more likely to follow longer term plans than the whims of individuals in order to maintain important strength once it has been created and to avoid dispersion of funds on short range projects this in turn may force academic institutions to look more closely and critically at their research and teaching programs they may be less likely to enter entirely new fields if there are substantial literature requirements especially if these requirements have been met by a neighboring institution yet the scholarly libraries as a group must find ways of providing the materials required by an individual investigator for the individual is still critical to scholarship planning must extend resources not stifle research and initiative books in stiff covers will still be available but they will be found in convenient association with other books and other forms of communication libraries will be busy places in which two structural differences will be conspicuous the readers direct access to books will be comfortable and convenient with a minimum of barriers and more readers will be housed with some degree of privacy than are readers today vast reading rooms
readjustments by the librarian  are unlikely to be built in the future nor are libranres going to lend themselves to beaux arts traditional exercises in architecture there may also be space in which to accommodate the library staff with efficiency but this may be only wishful thinking one quotes either aristotle or plato with some hesitancy these days but one of aristotle statements seems so fitting a conclusion to these speculative remarks that i cannot resist the temptation in practical matters the end is not mere speculative knowledge of what is to be done but rather the doing of it it is not enough to know about virtue then but we must endeavor to possess it and to use it or to take any other steps that may make us good aristotle nicomachean ethks x
