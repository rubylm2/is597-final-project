iv a feminist standpoint for library and information science education jane anne hannigan this paper was presented as the keynote address at alise february   the basic premises upon which librarianship and information science have been built are structured on white middle class male paradigms that have systematically if unconsciously silenced and excluded women we must work just as systematically to hear the voices of all those who have been silenced not just because it is right and just to do so but because it is inaccurate scholarship not to do so my task is to use a feminist standpoint to begin to correct that inaccuracy in curricula pedagogy and research in library and information science it is difficult to separate these three aspects of our work because they are in my view totally connected i have however for the purposes of this paper attempted to deal with them independently although from time to time my instinct to web ideas and information together overtakes me i am not suggesting that we ignore or eliminate more than one hundred years of accomplishments in our field but rather that we re examine our history and the basic premises both of that history and of current theory and practice to include ideas people and practices that have been excluded it is essential to begin any revision with a study of the epistemologies of feminism as a profession we have demonstrated concern for the advancement of women and for pay equity now is the time to explore the theoretical structures of feminist philosophy and thought curricula new pluralistic curricula in library and information science education that are intellectually valid and restructured to include multiple perspectives of race gender culture class religion sexual orientation and national origin may well in their diversity and connectedness to a variety of human experiences offer a positive and exciting future to our profession the design and implementation of such inclusive curricula is already taking place in many disciplines and is desperately needed in our own the effort to develop inclusive curricula in a profession that primarily consists of females must begin with gender let me make clear that i am using the word gender not in a biological sense but rather in an experiential way that is as a social construction it is simplistic to suggest that we revise the curriculum to include a few citations to books or articles by and about women i fall  
 journal of education for library and information science about the author fane anne hannigan is professor emerita columbia university seek a much greater share of the total curriculum i want us to study women ways of knowing and the riches available in feminist scholarship that will enlighten our curricula our teaching and our research peggy mclntosh offers a framework that many faculties in a variety of disciplines have used in the analysis and re writing of curricula she identified five phases of curriculum revision  womanless history  women in history  women as a problem anomaly or absence in history  women as history and  history redefined or reconstructed to include us all it should be obvious that we have treated our predominately female profession as if all major theory and research has been contributed by men thus we created a womanless history suzanne hildenbrand writes library history has been therefore largely a history omen often directors of large libraries by men areas in which almost no men participated notably children work were and continue to be almost totally without history in sydney pierce dead germans and the theory of librarianship the author suggests a reconstruction of our intellectual and theoretical literature sadly she herself does not represent women concerns typical are the responses of five male library educators who name only male librarians to qualify as dead germans an important point made by marilyn schuster and susan van dyne is that it seems intellectually irresponsible to allow an increasingly tenured faculty whose primary research will never be on women to continue teaching for the foreseeable future as though scholarship on women and an informing female perspective did not exist this seems particularly relevant to librarianship the radical transformation of a curriculum really involves a transformation of the conception of self at an intellectual level as well as at its deepest unconscious level thus women faculty must recognize that conflict is an inevitable part of the process of change and that conflict should be openly acknowledged and used to move the change process forward the problem for us is one of recognizing the ways women have been absented and devalued in librarianship for example school librarianship has a rich history of innovative and creative women yet they and their contributions are almost never discussed in either text or classroom it is easier to marginalize or wipe them from library history there may be resistance before we are able to reclaim and rewrite women positive contributions in a way that not only acknowledges but celebrates a diversity of values previously absent from the traditional paradigm of our field we must ask ourselves whether the historical exclusion of women in librarianship and information science has limited the questions asked in our discipline the movement from phase  to phase  of mclntosh framework is a necessary step but one that is deceptive in its image of inclusiveness implicit in it is the concept of a few exceptional women making it on male standards volume  number 
a feminist standpoint  thus it denies the centrality of women to our history to simply add the names of margreet wijnstroom adelaide haase or clara stanton jones without adequately exploring the overall contributions of other women who were their contemporaries does not accomplish what is necessary in mclntosh third phase women are treated as a problem this generates a response of anger to the established canon and to the absence of women in the structuring of our professional knowledge often this anger originates with the startling realization of the politics and assumptions that have caused women absence in an earlier paper i examined the absence of women theorists in several management texts used in our discipline i note with continued and increased anger that the  edition of stueart and moran clearly one of the most frequently used texts in management courses in addressing what the future may hold in management trends repeats the identical sentence found in the previous edition and i quote finally but most important the issue of women and minorities as managers is receiving due consideration in examining both the text and the bibliographies in this book one finds that there are no feminist theorists identified for the reader clearly this issue is not yet receiving due consideration androcentric attitudes impede women advancement and deprive the profession of full human potential in many ways in recent discussions on internet students reported the occurrence of gender bias in career counseling by library school faculty which i consider an extension of curricula unfortunately such androcentric views are held not only by our male colleagues even those of us who consider ourselves feminist sometimes succumb by assuming that our male students will more likely be hired in certain types of positions and therefore recommend them rather than equally qualified women it will take time to raise faculty consciousness and to counsel individuals in relation to their responsibility to students and to the profession in my mind it is a moral imperative for deans to take a leadership role in this matter androcentric attitudes impede women advancement and deprive the profession of full human potential in many ways it is also very distressing that much theory and research in the field seems oblivious to feminist scholarship it is after all library literature that our students read analyze and evaluate as part of their educational experience an examination of fourteen major journals in our profession indicates a poor representation of feminist scholarship see appendix although this table does not include all the major journals it is a representative snapshot and includes those journals available in a major university library and through the assistance of colleagues the data displayed in the appendix are drawn from on account of sex and my analysis of the  selected literature in all cases a broad rather than narrow definition of feministwomen studies was used for counting articles and signed columns only  percent of all the articles published in these journals in  had any feminist content it is an embarrassment that a profession such as ours which is predominately female has such inadequate representation of feminist concerns until we produce a sizable body of feminist literature we must draw upon feminist fall 
 journal of education for library and information science thinking and writing in other disciplines in order to inform our own it may be probable that most women in library and information science are not writing from a feminist standpoint but we must also question whether when they do write they are being published i believe that the library press appears to have a negative bias that is demonstrated by the way they consistently ignore feminist scholarship in general the press does not seem to commission articles from a feminist perspective nor does it appear to look kindly on such submissions but an editor can make a difference wilson library bulletin has published five feminist articles this year under new editor grace anne de candido editors like school library journal lillian gerhardt and gloriana st clair of college and research libraries are also in the forefront of accepting such material the canadian journal of information and library science devoted an entire issue in  to women studies there has been a raised consciousness regarding feminist problems in cataloging and subject indexing but the problems still exist although i have not conducted a formal study of monograph publishing in our field a casual observation reveals little being published in a discussion with phyllis weisbard women studies librarian at wisconsin she noted that fewer feminist books are even reviewed in the library press than might be expected one is enormously grateful then for such publications as new books on women  feminism feminist collections a quarterly of women studies resources women library workers journal belles lettres and the women review of books there has been a raised consciousness regarding feminist problems in cataloging and subject indexing but the problems still exist kristin gerhard trudi jacobson and susan williamson report in their study of indexing adequacy using the case of women studies that over  percent of the journals were inadequately indexed in january  library literature does not have any subject headings for feminist or feminism after several telephone conversations in december and january however editor cathy rentschler has agreed to add feminist and feminism to the indexing terms as of march  she has also agreed to add appropriate sub terms as needed let us now go back to mclntosh and her conceptualization of a fourth phase of curriculum development that values the assigned work of women in every culture thus winning and losing characteristic of earlier phases of curriculum development when women are seen as excellent only in comparison to men is not as important as the decent survival of all this is where we are aiming right now wishing to value women work in librarianship  valuing what women do and asking what is the special contribution that women have made to the profession of librarianship what for instance can we learn from observing the practice of female school library media specialists academic librarians or corporate librarians this phase also acknowledges women who because of home and family responsibilities cannot afford to get on the fast track to leadership and values the work of women that has been invisible behind the scenes supportive of others rather than striving to reach the top once this phase has been reached the curriculum becomes more speculative and experimental in its volume  number 
a feminist standpoint   epistemology for there have to be new categories of experience new ways of doing research and new ways of teaching boundaries break down between disciplines between teacher and subject and between teacher and student in the fifth stage of curricular transformation mclntosh sees knowledge redefined and reconstructed as inclusive rather than exclusive a phase five curriculum would help us to produce students who can see patterns of life in terms of systems of race culture caste class gender religion national origin geographical location and other influences on life which we haven begun to name women share the educational backgrounds that are primarily those of the androcentric white society many women who work in libraries do not fully realize how much of their former education has ignored the major portion of our world population that bias encompasses not only women but persons of color schuster and van dyne also are insistent that race and class be included with gender as a category of analysis this is particularly important in light of future growth in what are now minorities in the us population and the subsequent need to recruit and retain both men and women from these populations to work as professionals in librarianship and information science we teach from a set of predetermined assumptions about people and about cultures that impedes the success of our education of professionals if we do not approach our curricula responsibilities with a mind set that is inclusive rather than exclusive we are doomed to failure curricula solutions it is not my responsibility to rewrite curricula for librarianship and information science but i have provided a lens to examine the status quo i will now suggest specific things that might be done in revisioning curricula special topics courses in feminist theoryscholarship and methodology taught with an interdisciplinary focus at both the master and phd levels should be seriously considered and developed based on a sound grounding in feminist theory and scholarship many such attempts place women in a problem status but they are a move in the right direction alternative approaches might include for example a management course incorporating feminist theory and scholarship that could be the initial impetus to transform management courses as well as other courses in the curriculum we teach from a set of predetermined assumptions about people and about cultures that impedes the success of our education of professionals the work of kathy ferguson is critical to providing a feminist perspective on the bureaucracy of management as is the work of kathleen iannello iannello presents a study of modified consensus as a construct in organizational interventions that might be used in libraries the australian study by clare burton opens the wide range of concerns faced by women in the workplace when federal legislation in this case the federal equal economic opportunity laws of australia is operationalized burton discusses the nature of organizational bias and human resources management commenting that often society places lesser value on women work and thus wage equity is challenged fall 
 journal of education for library and information science additionally in either management library issues andor ethics courses a unit on sexual harassment must be included we must be aware that age and recent societal events are factors in the way we respond to such harassment the code of silence that many of us accepted and even taught is intolerable to today young women for example one might study and use the two part article on sexual harassment by sarah watstein in wilson library bulletin to provide students with the opportunity to address this subject and resolve situations that are realistic and job oriented the documents to which watstein refers are excellent choices and with the addition of several newer works on sexual harassment might enlarge the context for thinking and discussion of both teachers and students adding such a unit presupposes an understanding of principles the law and values in issues of sexual harassment it would be mutually beneficial to include professionals from the practicing community in such a unit to interact with students on this issue this might be done in a face to face colloquium or through telecommunications or simple internet exchanges using a mentoring system feminist scholarship involves looking at the assumptions and biases particularly androcentric biases incorporated in theory and research that directly affect the ways libraries collect store and disseminate materials and the choice of services offered to users thus feminist scholarship can by providing alternative perspectives make a difference in the teaching of courses such as collection development and user services one example of how theory and research affect collection development and library and information services regards aging there is much critical commentary on the fact that to date the older woman has been seen only in relation to research on aging in men to what extent do faculty raise issues of completeness and balance in such findings with their students alternative more inclusive approaches would involve seeing what is absent from such information or simply not seen because of the single lens perspectives that are taken how might alternative views of aging from a woman perspective alter or add to our understanding of library practice to what extent does this alter curricula content in reference collection development and popular culture feminist scholarship involves looking at the assumptions and biases particularly androcentric biases incorporated in theory and research that directly affect the ways libraries collect store and disseminate materials and the choice of services offered to users new work on a women biography has been addressed in the collection edited by sara alpern and her coauthors this work provides insightful comments on the differences of approach to a biography once one is consciously involved in feminist constructs discussion of the points made by the individual biographers in a reference class andor a literature class might alter the ways in which we teach selection of materials and readers advisory services similar insights might result from a discussion of janice radway work on women reading information can also be hidden bevolume  number 
a feminist standpoint  cause of gender biases in indexing and cataloging practices that make that information difficult to retrieve for example we have taken for granted the hierarchical structures of classification by dewey and others that have been imposed on our field as the only viable approaches in actuality we might spend time in classes and in research considering alternative non hierarchical structures particularly since computers have offered us new capabilities that permit many more quantum leaps than were feasible just a few years ago we are still teaching dewey and lc and think we are on top of things by adding oclc and rlin records control to cataloging courses increasingly paraprofessionals are responsible for most aspects of cataloging thus it might be advantageous to explore new directions in subject analysis retrieval structures and user dominant constructs we are still teaching a book location paradigm in technical services courses with some consideration of a bibliographic record model but with little or no consideration of the cognitive functions in classification certainly this latter approach would make for sound discussions of the mapping of knowledge and the concepts of hierarchical versus relational strategies thesauri might form a natural means to initiate such discussion a women thesaurus by mary ellen capek for example has less emphasis on the syntactic structures and more on semiotic relationships webbing is a feminist concept that forces one to see numerous relationships and leaves an open endedness to a mapping process cognitive concepts such as these appear to have a connection with the virtual library or virtual world of information the kinds of structures observed in these newer interactive technological systems bear a greater resemblance to a feminist model than to an androcentric one this might if one were to study it creatively have a direct bearing on the selection of content of courses in classification and cataloging as well as indexing and aspects of information science sara ruddick concept of maternal thinking as a thinking that arises from a practice could provide a framework for the special kind of work that children librarians do although maternal thinking basically refers to the valuing of women thought as it develops within the context of raising and nurturing children ruddick disassociates it entirely from biological motherhood it is an ethical mode of thinking that both men and women may develop as they nurture others children librarians practice a special kind of nurturance that fosters the intellectual emotional and social growth of young people in a caring and sharing environment through the fostering nurturing and connectedness in the practice of children librarianship young people and materials are brought together in a way that brings joy to experiences with informational and aesthetic content and subsequently encourages a life long love of literature and learning ruddick work along with that of carol gilligan and others is particularly important in the education of children librarians and school library media specialists gilligan understanding of gender differences as revealed in her modifications of kohlberg work on moral development has become part of the mainstream study of child and adolescent development theories unfortunately however this theory and the ethics of care it represents is often just studied without any real effort to translate it into practice children and young adult literature courses also included in the graduate education of those intending to work with young people frequently do not make serious attempts to include the fall 
 journal of education for library and information science voices of young people of all races cultures and classes in the accepted canons of these literatures kay vandergrift sets forth a feminist research agenda for youth literature that impacts upon curricula in these courses for example not only does she suggest a re examination of the literary canon but also studies of narrative structures and feminist approaches to reader response theory and criticism incorporating these ideas into such courses alters significantly the way we think about young people and the library services and materials provided for them a real acceptance of feminist scholarship cries out for the inclusion and integration of ethical and moral values in all aspects of library and information science curricula a real acceptance of feminist scholarship cries out for the inclusion and integration of ethical and moral values in all aspects of library and information science curricula an important aspect of being a professional is the process of making decisions feminist thought calls on us to recognize the often unstated moral and ethical values that influence that decision making curricula need to provide opportunities for students to explore their professional values in relation to such issues as censorship fee based services equity of access and personnel management the ethical and moral premise of restructured curricula also must be incorporated into the patterns of classroom relationships between and among faculty and students we must learn to build upon a user centered here student centered approach and the philosophy of care in the classroom so that our students will be able to transfer these values to the workplace after graduation the participatory collaborative approach to teaching and learning grounded in the context of diverse human experience must take its rightful and valued place in the educational enterprise curricula planning should also consider issues of gender in relation to the technologies employed by library and information science professionals evidence indicates that men and women have different feelings about and expectations of the use of technology thus we cannot assume that technology is neutral accepting that gender differences might exist for our students implies curricula alteration to meet differing needs in addition designing courses that are either totally theoretical or totally practical is to ignore student needs if students are to grasp the concepts of human information behavior they must be placed in the context for such behaviors from even this brief discussion it should be obvious that adding a few readings about women in librarianship does not constitute curricula revisioning the token approach has never worked the kind of intense research and study needed to offer a wide range of alternatives is a heady process i have spent many years reading listening to lectures sharing ideas with women online studying syllabi and i have joined in small discussion groups all in an attempt to explore what it means to learn as a woman pedagogy research indicates that there are differences between the way women learn and the way men learn to ignore that volume  number 
a feminist standpoint  women differ in their experiences their backgrounds and their attitudes is to ignore reality research tells us that women seek connections and tend to value situational opportunities many but not all women prefer the relational or webbing approach rather than the linear approach to dealing with information and ideas one notes with interest the current vision of those who are designing virtual realities and interactive media environments they assume a relational rather than a linear model the human genome project has recognized the need to move beyond the pure genetic sciences to examine law and ethics as natural and integral portions of the project such reaching out to connect a variety of ideas across disciplines and concerns is characteristically female women scientists have had a profound influence on the way research and project design in the sciences is now done faculty often approach interaction with students in a listening for mode rather than a listening to mode too often we consider logical linear means of organizing information and ideas as the only appropriate way and therefore listen for a specific logical answer that fits our pattern of expectations feminist thought on the other hand acknowledges alternative forms of relational thinking and networked ideas and allows students to place their own ideas anywhere within that network it is in listening to those ideas that teachers can expand their own thinking and see new relationships and therefore help students make connections among content and between content and their own lives the myers briggs type indicator has a long established validity and is widely used in this country with a direct relationship to jungian psychology it offers an opportunity to examine how people garner information and how they make decisions with the results of such a test it might be possible to design teaching models that will match the needs of our students too often faculty employ a pedagogical approach chosen in isolation from the students we teach to continue to ignore the unique voices of women as well as men in our classes is more than a stupidity it is detrimental to the profession often students are not pleased in classes because faculty members structure everything to match their own learningteaching styles one of the most difficult aspects of teaching is the matching of teaching strategies to the learning styles of students in the awarefeminist thought acknowledges alternative forms of relational thinking and networked ideas and allows students to place their own ideas anywhere within that network ness of diversity within a class and in accepting responsibility for responding to that diversity faculty members fulfill their responsibility as teachers it might come as a shock to some faculty to learn that they may not always be right in their views and in the accuracy of what they teach furthermore what they teach may or may not be accepted by students to move to a cooperative learning process is to move to the acceptance of alternative views in an environment that encourages questioning and is accepting of alternative approaches and answers as valid responses another basic area of curricula within library education that cries out fall 
ó journal of education for library and information science for a more humanistic inclusive usercentered teaching approach is that of reference services too often reference service is perceived almost exclusively in terms of the tools that contain the information thought to be important to our society rather than in terms of the library patron and the context in which the reference encounter occurs david can says in practice information problems are likely to be solved from the center outward  where the center is the user reference students need to be more concerned with the process of inquiry and discovery than with the endless competition to learn the most tools in reference class for example we might form several small study groups provide each with a profile of a large public library andor academic library and of a client seeking information on a topic such as williams syndrome substitute a different disease for each cluster have each group discuss the nature of the client what might be known about the client how to determine what it is that the client is seeking how to employ an ethics of care and how to maintain the accuracy and recency of data presented to the client it is in the discovery process that we learn the most in point of fact what we discover in the aforementioned example is that information valued as most helpful to the client is not in a tool but rather in an informal network of parents with williams syndrome children the concept of working in groups both inside and outside class meeting times provides essential opportunities to discuss and share approaches to an issue problem or concern flexibility of both faculty members and students is critical to this learning style i have spoken with several faculty who use the cooperative approach and small and large teams for assignments and each reports success although they also note the frequency of student complaints about meeting time constraints and potential grading inequities most disciplines that have used this approach report similar findings but indicate overall success in their research reports spacial arrangement of the learning environment can i believe make a difference in student attitude and responses an understanding of how we organize space who uses this space and for what purposes is critical to the learning process aspects of both the symbolic and multicultural value system are implicit but are often made explicit in spacial configurations as we look at data on technological bias by gender spacial constructs play a part how do libraries and library schools configure computer spaces do these spaces inhibit use by women might we foster equality through environments that are radically different women scholars have noted that shared discussion of issues and shared problem solving is a needed aspect of our teaching modified consensus occurs more easily when people are facing one another rather than in isolated or adversarial postures treichler and kramarae research suggests that the interaction of men and women differ in classroom settings and that overall it is the interaction of men in the academy that is valorized the university argue the authors is typically more compatible with and rewarding of men interaction patterns in addition to spacial configurations the way we prepare syllabi the way we design assignments the nature of our feedback all contribute to what students feel about their education and all require the intense study of faculty to provide the best quality our nurturing of students and the caring for those with whom they will work in libraries may sometimes lead us to dangerous educational practices historically as well as today we legitimize volume  number 
a feminist standpoint  content in the curriculum that should in fact be developed as practicums or other alternatives available to or required of students for instance creating courses to teach the navigation of the internet dialog or any other database is a modern technological version of the old courses in library hand or the use of audiovisual equipment we need to make this available to students but should not accept it within our already limited credit structure any more than we would accept credit for a typing course or the production of overhead transparencies there are several listservs devoted to the concerns of women i have noted that women in all disciplines have increasingly found their voices and are speaking out the use of the internet and the future of our involvement with it is a strong pedagogical issue i have spent the last several years monitoring various listservs and sharing ideas and information with colleagues not only in librarianship but in other disciplines as well i have seen flame wars harassment caring and sound informational exchange from all over the world yes i have witnessed males using listservs to silence women and in many cases unfortunately they succeed i have seen professionals provide information that was sloppy and even inaccurate obviously we have a great deal to learn from the net and we need to incorporate it in our teaching designs consider for a moment how many of you are active internet users i will admit my disappointment in noting that much of the conversation on listservs is not that of library and information science faculty one of the most difficult problems with the internet is that of time to determine the extent of involvement and the nature of that involvement is a concern assigning students the task of monitoring a listserv without providing an opportunity to discuss what they observe is an incomplete exercise but how does one discuss if you have not had some shared experiences research essential to changes in curricula and pedagogy is a solid base in research it is essential for researchers to acknowledge the authenticity of women subjective experience and knowledge  both our own as researchers and that of the women we might study this is a radical notion to those of us trained in androcentric objectivity in research feminist theory and research offers a sound approach that we might employ in our own discipline the tendency in research in librarianship and information science is to examine any problem from the perspective of the professional rather than addressing our research from the perspective of the user earlier patterns in user studies do not really shift this perspective because for the most part user responses were overshadowed by concepts of control through closed ended questionnaires and surveys i am suggesting that we make greater use of ethnographic research approaches that have proved successful in other disciplines for instance if we want to understand what value users place on libraries it might be useful to sit down and talk at length with a series of users and non users and then analyze the content of these discussions it is not in this plan to have a predetermined view but rather to listen to what participants say i believe that we may arrive at some surprising findings using such research strategies we assume a number of things about the ways our audiences use collections but we do not really know a patron degree of satisfaction in the individual use of fall 
 journal of education for library and information science materials our research has been dominated by quantitative studies organized in a logical fashion we must begin to consider such aspects as response based on gender race class and ethnicity which are rarely studied it is not indicating a biological sex or cultural heritage as a variable that is critical rather it is dialoguing from the standpoint of persons in these categories too often we concentrate on collecting data to prove what we have already determined rather than collecting data and then analyzing that data with a more open mind to see what that data tells us furthermore some of the most important information to be gained from respondents may not even fit into the data sets we have predetermined i would draw an analogy here to so called scientific experiment books for young people many of which are the antithesis of experimentation some of these books attempt to convince young readers that if they have not exactly replicated the results of an experiment they are in error and should repeat the experiment until they get it right rather than analyzing the results they did get one area of research that needs to be examined is that of gender bias in school library media centers there is a wealth of research from the american association of university women aauw and others who report various forms of gender bias in schooling nonetheless there has been little if any research to study gender bias in the library media center gender bias may occur in collection development in our interactions with students and in the computer configurations and use that we formulate in preliminary research on gender bias vandergrift identified a variable that alters the way we might approach such research namely many practitioner researchers did not recognize gender bias in their own behavior in fact most were taken aback by the sudden recognition that they were indeed gender biased in the evaluation of research for grants for projects for tenure and promotion decisions we need to allow for and above all we need to value a wide range of alternative research designs because you have been trained as a researcher do not assume that all good research must imitate your approach or be classed as less than acceptable this profession like others is not immune to arrogance and attitudes that diminish and devalue certain kinds of research and writing this obviously cannot continue if library education is to be vital in the twenty first century sarah pritchard raises a number of questions we might consider as research foci in examining technology from a feminist perspective do information technologies benefit the educational and economic status and the civic participation of women across society do women of diverse backgrounds and opinions have equitable access and opportunity to define and shape the directions and uses of information technology is the nature of the information itself transformed and broadened research must be undertaken to explore the nature of cognitive structures in all types of catalogs and databases if we continue to assume that z will solve all our future interactive problems we will suffer for that decision the very nature of interactivity will alter the way we form informational clusters to assume that z will solve everything is faulty thinking it is after all a mere technological device what are the implications and does this push the lines of demarcation between the haves and have nots even wider the conceptual frame encompassing the tovolume  number 
a feminist standpoint  tality of information and equal access to that totality is not being studied some feminists use photography and videotaping to collect andor elicit data we have not yet begun to grasp the potential of such methodologies in library research deborah brandt focused on four peruvian women whose literacy development is documented in her photo novella what is clear is that these women gradually grow in political awareness as they learn to read one characteristic to note is the consciousness raising of both the women in the study and that of the investigator often research from a feminist perspective leads to direct action that is a change in policy or in the lives of participants interdisciplinarity and interconnectedness are characteristic of much in women studies programs and research barriers of isolation have been thrown down and new linkages have been forged one of the most important research contributions to be made is to use a form of meta analysis to see what transfers from other disciplines are most appropriate there is no question that women studies and feminist scholarship have reached throughout academe if we accept a new vision of history literature philosophy and science then we will have to accept that the structures of library and information science may need alteration to accommodate new needs of the researcher and the student if the historiananthropologistenglish scholar is willing to accept the quilt the pot the decorative object even personal decoration as valid research data what will we need to teach our students about research what research will help us to identify needs that in turn will influence and empower both our users and ourselves in my years of directing doctoral research i consistently encouraged and pushed my students to formulate their research in a rigorous and controlled fashion this was obviously the result of my education and experience i wanted all the research to be soundly based in theory and objective in reporting what i have come to recognize is the error of forcing objectivity and the need to openly value subjectivity it is in feminist scholarship that i find support for this approach conclusion finally i present ten recommendations or challenges to each of you hoping you will respond with positive action  i recommend cooperative research particularly feminist research among library schools and hope that government and other agencies will be willing to fund such endeavors   i recommend that we work to incorporate teaching styles that correspond more directly to the learning styles of our students and that feminist approaches to teaching be incorporated in all courses  i recommend that we cooperatively develop feminist units of study and make them available to all library schools for instance we should carefully examine our history and present female librarians as role models of theory and praxis  i recommend cooperative teaching both within the classroom and through the use of the internet as a teaching tool for example scenarios or cases could be assigned to students two or more faculty from different institutions and several practitioners from throughout the country could be asked to respond to student input this probably would be designed as a group report fall 
 journal of education for library and information science requiring only one set of responses rather than individual responses to each student  i recommend that we move directly into an interdisciplinary mode we should actively seek out colleagues in other disciplines and cooperatively plan and implement feminist courses workshops and institutes  i recommend the establishment of a women study group in each library school to address feminist theory and scholarship as well as issues of survival in academe this group might establish connections with other campuswide women studies groups  i recommend the establishment of continuing education or professional development programs both campus and non campus based including distance education that address issues of feminism in librarianship  i recommend that professional educators revitalize our relationship with alumnae and the practicing professional community to increase connectedness to practice much of the dialogue envisioned may take place through an individual listserv on a local internet node that is open to alumnis and the practicing community  i recommend that we develop a means to share feminist information and materials to better advance our discipline and that we encourage our colleagues in practice to do likewise for instance we might establish in conjunction with a current electronic archive such as that at the university of maryland electronic space to house feminist syllabi and feminist workshop materials for ease of retrieval by all  i recommend that we do all in our power to increase the consciousness of feminist theory and praxis throughout the professional literature let us make clear our concern to the editors of our journals and to the publishers of our books we simply must develop a body of literature for our field that is genderfair and more truly representative of over half the population our profession is predominately female and i find that a powerful image we have the opportunity to set forth a revision of library and information science education and a model of information and service to the public in a unique and innovative fashion feminist theory and praxis offer so much to us as a profession that we cannot afford to ignore my hope does not lie with the older generation of educators but rather with the new generations of faculty and doctoral students that are our future it will take intellectual study energy and personal bravery to embark on a course to alter the status quo of our profession to those of you in senior positions as faculty and administrators i hope you too will engage in this change process but my even greater hope is that you will encourage and support your colleagues who seek to advance the concept of women in our profession through their teaching curricula change and research it only remains for all of us to do so acknowledgment no paper of this dimension is completed without the help of many people i particularly thank the many people who responded to my questions on the internet and most specifically to those others who went out of their way to offer information to listen or to share ideas volume  number
