the career and job satisfaction of librarians and other information professionals is an important topic for library administrators library and information sciences faculty and individuals working in these careers job satisfaction as conceptualized in the current study refers to satisfaction with ones present job career satisfaction is satisfaction with ones career as a whole   while many variables contribute to career and job satisfaction  the present study focuses on personality traits that is relatively enduring characteristics of individuals that are relatively consistent over time and across situations  researchers in disciplines outside the field of library science have demonstrated that personality traits are important contributors to career and job satisfaction    and the present study extends this line of research to library science we offer the personality findings in this study with caution since they are aggregated for many different specialties within the information profession future reports by the present authors will focus on differences among the specialties career and job satisfaction an overview c l hulin and t a judge in their discussion of the literature on job attitudes point out there are more individual variables that may be regarded as antecedents or consequences of job attitudes than can be reasonably discussed in this chapter  e a locke who authored a seminal article the nature and causes of job satisfaction  found that at the time of that study there were  articles or dissertations on job satisfaction to help the reader gain an overview of the literature of job satisfaction we summarize the six models of job satisfaction presented by hulin and judge first the cornell model which was developed by p smith l kendall and c hulin  focused on the importance of frames of reference in mediating other factors in the formation of jobwork role evaluations past experiences may explain why some individuals rate apparently undesirable jobs highly and others express dissatisfaction with apparently desirable jobs j w thibaut and h w kelley  focused on the importance of comparison levels in determining job satisfaction if job role outcomes are less than expectations comparison levels the job will be perceived as dissatisfying if job role outcomes are higher than expected the job will be perceived as satisfying lockes valuepercept model  included a formula expressing job satisfaction as satisfaction  want  have  importance want was referred to as value content and have was referred to as perceived amount of value provided by the job importance represented the importance of the value to the individual the job characteristics model  focused on the importance of enriching job characteristics in producing job satisfaction the five important enriching characteristics were task identity being able to see ones work from beginning to end task significance ones work is seen as important and significant skill variety autonomy and feedback degree to which the employee receives feedback about his or her performance socalled disposition influences models of job satisfaction have focused on factors such as the gripe index  and more recently positive affectivity and negative affectivity positively affective individuals are often jovial selfassured and attentive negatively affective individuals tend to experience fear sadness guilt and hostility  judge locke and c c durham  focused on core selfevaluations an individuals fundamental beliefs about herself and her functioning in the world another dispositional influence on job satisfaction finally the last model of job satisfaction discussed by hulin and judge  is personenvironment fit personenvironment fit models emphasize complex multivariate interactions between person and environmental characteristics as determinants of job satisfaction  p  the multitude of theories about job satisfaction and the vast empirical literature base make it impossible for any single study to take all relevant variables into account hulin and judge provide a commonly accepted theoretical specification of job satisfaction job satisfactions are multidimensional psychological responses to ones job  p  the complexity of job satisfactions leads us to limit our area of inquiry to the role of information professionals personality factors in job satisfaction in line with judge et als  description of career satisfaction we treated it as one of the intrinsic subjectively defined elements of career success judge et al distinguish between career and job satisfaction as do we defining job satisfaction as satisfaction with the present job and career satisfaction as satisfaction with ones career as a whole career satisfaction is a broader construct than job satisfaction because it encompasses all the jobs that an individual has worked we examined both job satisfaction and career satisfaction in this study the two are interpretable as overlapping but different constructs because they are correlated  in the study which represents only  percent shared variance between the two constructs job satisfaction among librarians in summarizing the literature on job satisfaction in the library field from the s and s s g nandy  concluded it may be said that characteristics of both the individual and the job appear to be related to job satisfaction but they are intercorrelated to such an extent that it is extremely difficult to isolate them for scientific investigation  p  this point applies to later research on librarians job satisfaction as well with studies focusing on job characteristics individual characteristics or both for example m mirfakhrai  collected background demographic characteristics of academic librarians and also used the job descriptive index to measure their job satisfaction this instrument focuses on the work itself supervision pay coworkers and opportunities for promotion d s bengston and d shields  focused on job variables such as management style and wealthcollection size while replicating m p marchants predictive model of faculty evaluations of the library  job satisfaction among librarians was predicted by participative management style and collection size satisfaction among librarians led to higher university faculty ratings of the library a j bloom and c w mccawley  surveyed public librarians and administrators and found differences between the two groups on satisfaction with job characteristics pay communication and decision making job structure and the future l estabrook c bird and f l gilmore  studied the use of technology in relation to job stress with job satisfaction they also measured extrinsic rewards job characteristics such as income and opportunity for advancement intrinsic rewards individual factors such as amount of discretion over work and social integration and likes and dislikes race social integration income and job stress regressed significantly on job satisfaction for professionals b p lynch and j verdin studied contextual factors of job satisfaction in the  replication of their previous study  factors included gender tenure years worked in the particular library career commitment supervisory level functional department and occupational group nonprofessional or professional in the replication career orientation supervisory level departmental affiliation and occupational group were significantly associated with job satisfaction lynch and verdin also found that job routineness was significantly correlated with job satisfaction d h waters  studied the relationship between thirteen aspects of work varied interesting closely supervised regimented challenging simple independent hack fragmented routine repetitive creative and exciting and job satisfaction using the actfrequency approach g allen  developed a taxonomy of acts of librarians who fit their job well many of these acts described individual characteristics such as keeping current in the professional literature or responding positively to change b horenstein  focused on job characteristics investigating the relationship between faculty status and job satisfaction among academic librarians she found that there was a variety of differences between the satisfaction with aspects of their job of librarians without faculty status or rank of those who had either faculty status or rank and of those who had both faculty status and rank differences were also obtained between these three groups on their participation in professional activities g j leckie and j brett replicated horensteins work applying it to a canadian sample  job satisfaction and personality job satisfaction has been correlated with a variety of personality traits in psychology trait systems studied in relation to job satisfaction include the big five personality traits  h j eysencks personality system  psychoticism extraversion and neuroticism for later studies of eysenck system see also d m tokar and l m subich  a furnham and m zacherl  and furnham et al  most recently j w lounsbury et al  studied a diverse sample of  individuals in fourteen separate occupational groups and found that job satisfaction was significantly related to assertiveness conscientiousness customer service commitment emotional stability extraversion openness optimism toughmindedness and work drive   these traits are defined in the methods section of this article career satisfaction and personality although p tharenou  noted that few studies of career satisfaction have taken a personological approach judge et al  j w boudreau w r boswell and judge  and s e seibert and m l kramer  investigated the big five personality traits in relation to career satisfaction their findings established the importance of personality variables in accounting for variation in intrinsic career success also lounsbury et al  found that career satisfaction was significantly related to assertiveness conscientiousness customer service commitment emotional stability extraversion openness optimism toughmindedness and work drive with most of the variance in career satisfaction across occupations being accounted for by emotional stability work drive and optimism personality studies among librarians personality traits of librarians and other information professionals have been studied since   but until now there has been no comprehensive effort to relate job or career satisfaction to personality characteristics of librarians or other information professionals the largest study of librarians personality characteristics was m j scherdins  survey of  satisfied librarians with masters degrees in library or information science  scherdin employed the myersbriggs type indicator and found that librarians were most frequently introverted sensing thinking judging istj and introverted intuiting thinking judging intj types  percent and  percent respectively both types shared the characteristics of being logical productive and reflective scherdin pointed out while they differed on the sensingintuitive scale sensing s types are drawn to occupations that let them use their practical skills where they can deal with facts intuitive n like situations in which they look at possibilities think independently and problemsolve at a systems level  p  another study by a goulding et al focused on  information and library science students in the united kingdom  these students were administered the sixteen personality factors instrument r cattell and were found to be less abstract thinking and bright less affected by feelings less submissive and humble but more tender minded and sensitive more trusting and accepting more imaginative more insecure and selfblaming more socially precise and more relaxed and tranquil than the normative population  p  for other studies of personality traits among librarians see j agadas review  research goals the present study was undertaken not only as a partial replication of the previous studies of personality correlates of career satisfaction but also as an extension of prior results in other occupational fields by examining additional personality variables in relation to career and job satisfaction for information professionals there are of course many personality traits one could study in this context we followed the guidelines of r j schneider l m hough and m d dunnette  in selecting for study personality traits that have been found in previous research to be related to career and job satisfaction and that appear to be relevant for the general type of work performed by information professionals accordingly we had the following five research goals   to examine whether the personality traits of adaptability assertiveness autonomy conscientiousness customer service commitment emotional stability extraversion openness optimism teamwork toughmindedness visionary work style and work drive are significantly related to job satisfaction for information professionals   to examine whether the personality traits of adaptability assertiveness autonomy conscientiousness customer service commitment emotional stability extraversion openness optimism teamwork toughmindedness visionary work style and work drive are significantly related to career satisfaction for information professionals   to examine the amount of variance in job satisfaction that can be accounted for by these personality traits   to examine the amount of the variance in career satisfaction that can be accounted for by these personality traits   to attempt to replicate for information professionals lounsbury et als finding of the importance of emotional resilience optimism and work drive in relation to job satisfaction and career satisfaction  method participants the participants for this study consisted of a nonrandom sample of  librarians and information science professionals who responded to print or email solicitations to fill out the personality inventory the inventory was available in print form as an email attachment and as a web form subjects were solicited via email messages to libntl tlal ebssl new breed librarian syslibl autocat child_lit archivesl recmgmtl and offcamp during the summer and fall of  and through print surveys left on tables at a national librarians conference annual american library association conference summer  nonrandom samples do not permit inferences about the populations from which they are derived  but are widely used in applied social science research especially in correlational designs such as the present one the institutional review board human subjects permission was received to conduct this study and all subjects data were kept confidential respondents who indicated that they wished to receive individualized feedback were sent via email a microsoft word document interpreting their scores on the inventory although geographic locale was not included in the inventory email extensions indicated that the sample was international in scope including subjects from australia canada the united kingdom new zealand the united states and other countries those participants who did not work in a professional library or information science position were deleted from the sample for example library science students library technicians or paraprofessionals clerks and business analysts were not included the following demographic information was collected about respondents job title which included an other choice and a blank to enter current profession years employed in present job and years employed in an information profession one of the job title choices medical or law librarian was expanded to encompass special librarian during data analysis those respondents who chose the other category for the job title question because of multiple job titles were arbitrarily assigned to the category for one of their job titles when possible no further demographic data were collected the demographic data are summarized in table  table  demographic characteristics of the information profession sample

matter experts in information professions were consulted during the development of the personality inventory these experts were asked to list the traits of successful members of the information professions studied the authors measured these traits using relevant components of the personal style inventory psi  a proprietary workbased normal personality measurement system the psi consisted of  questions measuring sixteen scales adaptability assertiveness autonomy conscientiousness customer service emotional stability extraversion openness optimism teamwork toughmindedness visionary work style work drive life satisfaction career satisfaction and job satisfaction table  provides a brief construct definition for the personality traits measured by our inventory table  personality constructs measured by the inventory construct definition number of items potential benefit adaptability refers to a person being flexible and able to make onthespot adjustments to different situations high scorers are able to go with the flow respond flexibly to changing circumstances and function comfortably with change low scorers tend to be more rigid and inflexible preferring to work in unchanging settings with predictable outcomes  flexibility may be important to information professionals due to the everchanging nature of their work assertiveness refers to a persons ability to assert himherself taking charge of situations speaking up on matters of importance defending personal beliefs and being forceful  assertiveness may be important for information professionals in leadership or public service roles autonomy a disposition to function autonomously and in a selfdirected manner on ones job to make work decisions and choose a course of action without reliance on others  autonomy may be necessary for information professionals who work alone conscientiousness refers to a persons conscientiousness reliability trustworthiness and readiness to internalize company norms and values  conscientiousness may be useful to information professionals who need to uphold policies and rules customer service orientation striving to provide highly responsive personalized quality service to internal and external customers putting the customer first and trying to satisfy the customer even if it means going above and beyond the normal job description or policy  customer service orientation may be helpful to information professionals who deal with the public emotional resilience overall level of adjustment and emotional resilience in the face of job stress and pressure this can be conceptualized as the inverse of neuroticism  emotional resilience may help information professionals deal with stress extraversion tendency to be sociable outgoing gregarious warmhearted and talkative  extraversion may help information professionals in public service or leadership roles openness receptivityopenness to change innovation new experience and learning  openness may aid information professionals who must learn on their jobs optimism refers to a person having an optimistic hopeful outlook concerning prospects people and the future even in the face of difficulty and adversity  optimism may be helpful to information professionals in dealing with coworkers and the public teamwork propensity for working as part of a team and cooperatively on work group efforts  teamwork may be helpful to information professionals who must work in teams toughmindedness appraising information and making work decisions based on logic facts and data rather than feelings values or intuition  toughmindedness may be helpful to information professionals who must solvetechnical problems work drive disposition to work long hours including overtime and an irregular schedule greater investment of ones time and energy into job and career and being motivated to extend oneself if necessary to finish projects meet deadlines be productive and achieve job success  work drive may be important to ambitious individuals in information professions visionary vs operational work style refers to a work style which emphasizes creating an organizational vision and mission developing corporate strategy identifying longterm goals and planning for future contingencies versus an operational work style which focuses on daytoday activities and accomplishments shortterm goals current problems and implementation of plans  information professionals who must do longrange planning may benefit from a visionary work style information professionals who must deal with routine operations and be attentive to details may benefit from an operational work style all scale items have been used extensively in a wide range of organizations and have been validated for a variety of jobs    following the work of m j schmit et al  some of the questions were especially contextualized for the information science professions for this study an example of a question that was contextualized is the following given the chance i would be much more interested in activities like developing procedures specifying work practices and allocating resources for the library or organization      given the chance i would be much more interested in activities like creating an inspiring vision for the future of the library or organization in addition to these personality variables there were two questions measuring career satisfaction ones satisfaction with ones career as a whole and eight questions measuring job satisfaction ones satisfaction with ones current job one of the career satisfaction items was similar to the one used by lounsbury et al  to establish personalitycareer satisfaction relationships that were validated across occupations the job satisfaction items were previously used by j w lounsbury and l l hoopes  the job and career satisfaction measures correlated  in this study which means that they shared only  percent common variance and can be considered separate variables the number of questions adds up to  rather than  because there was also a life satisfaction question not analyzed in the present study results table  presents the descriptive statistics and coefficient alphas of the study variables the coefficient alphas for eight of the measures were greater than  with somewhat lower alphas observed for autonomy  and career satisfaction  which is probably the result of the small number of items in each measure three and two respectively more modest coefficient alphas were also observed for conscientiousness  and customer service  the correlations among the study variables are also reported in table  table  coefficient alpha descriptive statistics and intercorrelations for the study variables

the correlation between two variables    specifically the aim of a regression analysis is to derive an equation relating a dependent and an explanatory variable or more commonly several explanatory variables the derived equation may sometimes be used solely for prediction but more often its primary purpose is as a way of establishing the relative importance of the explanatory variables in determining the response variable that is in establishing a useful model to describe the data  p  discussion the present findings indicate that personality traits are significantly related to job and career satisfaction for the information professionals in this study in the case of job satisfaction ten of the thirteen personality traits studied were correlated significantly moreover all of the thirteen traits were significantly correlated with career satisfaction the results of this study are consistent with the findings of lounsbury et al  for other occupational groups the hierarchical regression analyses support lounsbury et als  g factor of emotional resilience work drive and optimism as predictors of career satisfaction they found that across fourteen occupations  percent of the variance in career satisfaction was accounted for by these three measures whereas the other personality measures added only  percent this is similar to the present results of  percent of the variance in career satisfaction accounted for by these three measures whereas the other significant personality measure added only  percent thus the present results augment the generalizability or external validity  of lounsbury et als  g or general factor for predicting career satisfaction in diverse occupational groups without generalizing beyond our nonrandom sample we may speculate that these results are readily interpretable in the context of the information profession emotionally resilient individuals are likely to be better able to handle the stress and strain of todays information jobs than emotionally reactive individuals as j nawe  points out stress is prevalent in the information profession ironically major sources of both satisfaction and stress to the library and information workforce are patrons and their colleagues they also experience stress in response to budget cuts low status accorded to the profession coping with the demands of an endless proliferation of software interfaces varying equipment and configurations and escalating user demands lack of specialist knowledge excessive workload communicating with strangers unsatisfactory working conditions bad management and monotony of work  p  we may also speculate that optimistic individuals may well receive more intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction for positive outlooks particularly in libraries where employees are often encouraged to project a positive image to patrons and the larger community individuals with higher levels of work drive are probably better than those with lower levels of work drive at handling the multiple and increasing demands associated with todays information professions as observed by h l eiring  p  the new competencies required for success comprise two broad categories technical and personal  personal skills include the ability to interact with diverse individuals in a broad range of situations to maximize collaboration and understanding the results of the stepwise multiple regression analyses indicate that a relatively small subset of traits can account for a substantial amount of the variance in both career satisfaction and job satisfaction in this sample collectively optimism emotional resilience teamwork visionary work style and work drive accounted for  percent of the variance in job satisfaction also optimism work drive emotional resilience and assertiveness accounted for  percent of the variance in career satisfaction for this sample it may be that the role of teamwork in predicting job satisfaction for the sample reflects a more recent or greater emphasis on work teams and the importance of cooperation in current jobs perhaps visionary work style may also have contributed positively to job satisfaction because those who focus on longrange goals over the details of particular job environments may be more satisfied with these environments it may be that assertiveness leads to more career satisfaction because assertive individuals have more leadership skills and thus may experience greater extrinsic career success rewarding assignments promotions salary etc there are several organizational and individuallevel issues resulting from this study first in view of the burgeoning literature in industrial organization demonstrating the many uses of personality traits in preemployment assessment   one can with caution draw implications from our study to the recruitment and selection of candidates for information science jobs for example the employing organization might try to recruit and select individuals for information job openings who are more optimistic resilient hard working assertive teamminded and visionary in their work style also these characteristics might be emphasized in employee orientation and training programs further supervisors could try to adjust their management style to accommodate personality differences for example employees with greater work drive could be assigned more challenging projects or employees with lower levels of emotional resilience could be given more time to complete stressful tasks and if necessary be provided with stressreduction training or employee assistance programs another possible application would be to have supervisors adjust their coaching and mentoring styles to employee personality characteristics for example a supervisor could give an employee feedback on the interpersonal consequences of hisher pessimistic style and encourage the employee to be more positive around coworkers and patrons it should be noted here that although personality traits are fairly consistent over time and across situations there is opportunity for trait modification as shown by seligmans work on learned optimism however that pessimism may be better suited for job situations that involve anticipating problems or checking for errors such as cataloging similarly individuals could look for projects that are best suited to their personality and over the course of a career look for jobs that offer the best personenvironment fit finally individuals with an unfavorable prognosis for job and career satisfaction in an information job might want to consider a different career path another strategy might be to try to modify behavior associated with trait levels through targeted coaching or counseling efforts for example returning to the example of optimismpessimism an individual who is more pessimistic ie lower on optimism could focus on developing strategies to increase optimism see eg  or he could try to better use his pessimistic disposition by employing a defensive pessimism strategy   especially if he is also anxious as this could allow him to manage his anxiety more effectively limitations several limitations of the present study should be noted first the sample was selfselecting so it cannot be considered representative of the population of librarians the study was limited to a small subset of personality variables chosen on the basis of consulting subject experts in the information professions it is possible that other variables such as image management or agreeableness would enter into career and job satisfaction as well while personality variables were the focus of this study a number of extrinsic and intrinsic job characteristics could also be studied in relation to career and job satisfaction also separate analyses for the different types of information professionals were not performed however the authors will undertake this in future research directions for future research an interesting topic for future research is to examine potential differences among the various types of information professionals in relation to personality traits and career and job satisfaction it would also be worthwhile to determine the relationships between information professionals personality characteristics and other key job criteria such as absenteeism turnover and job performance it would be interesting to study other classes of information professionals not included in this study by way of illustration the  occupational outlook handbook  reported that there were approximately  jobs for archivists curators and museum technicians in  and  jobs for librarians network and computer systems administrators jobs numbered about  these are just a few of the occupations opened to information science graduates other occupations include chief information officers intellectual capital specialists information brokers indexers and web miners conclusion the present study indicates that a number of personality traits are significantly related to both career and job satisfaction for a sample of  information professionals information professionals who were more optimistic emotionally resilient team minded visionary in their work style and hard working were more likely to report higher levels of job satisfaction in this study individuals who were more satisfied with information professions as their careers were significantly more optimistic emotionally resilient hard working and assertive than those who were less career satisfied these results also replicate and extend the finding of lounsbury et al  concerning the importance of emotional resilience work drive and optimism in relation to both job and career satisfaction administrators in the information profession who are involved in hiring and managing employees might want to consider using personality information in their work we plan to develop a tool that would be helpful for such purposes
