impolite hostilities and vague sympathies academia as a site of cyclical abuse nicole a cooke university of illinois urbana champaign nacookeillinoisedu in this autoethnographic article i reflect on my experiences as a now tenured faculty member of color which have been punctuated by incivility bullying stress and abuse as part of reconciling several acute events i came to a distinct realization of what i had been going through i was able to name it and i was able to articulate the strategies i had been using to cope and thrive this reflective piece is not meant to minimize the experiences of non minority faculty but it is absolutely meant to highlight and emphasize the specific challenges of being faculty member of color in library and information science and in the academy writ large keywords abusive behavior counter storytelling faculty of color faculty retention workplace stress realizing a practitioner colleague who idenkey points tifies as a white woman recently expressed pure frustration toward her  faculty of color in all disciplines fellow white librarians particularly face oppressions because her female colleagues she said that of their gender race sexual her colleagues do a great job espousorientation religion and for ing diversity and inclusion in public simply existing in predominantly but when it comes time to back up white spaces where their their words with actions not only do countenances are not the norm they fail to do so but they also say egregious things to one another in private  academic bullying abuse to justify their inaction they speak aggression and incivility can privately to those they perceive to be affect the success health and like minded to justify their latent and retention of faculty of color not always latent biases and maintain their perceived power and privilege in  counter storytelling challenges disavowing this behavior my colleague us to complicate and disrupt referred to these rationalizations as the dominant narratives and polite hostilities i pushed back on to add important stories and this phrase while i know precisely experiences to the literature what types of behaviors and comments and to the field  journal of education for library and information science  vol  no  doi jelis 
 cooke she was referring to i have never perceived them to be polite rather they have been rather pointed and dismissive my experience has been with impolite hostilities or with just plain hostilities she concurred stating that if she was offended by what she was hearing from other white women she could only imagine what people must say to me and what effect it has on me as a black woman indeed but it is not just what people say it is what people do when i contemplate the things people do especially in academia these are impolite hostilities these include what people do passively or by omission eg benign neglect what people do actively eg the silent treatment what people do unintentionally eg judge or act in accordance with their implicit biases and what people do intentionally eg deliberate racism s exism etc some of these actions are easy to identify and many are absolutely subtle all are harmful and hard to address prove and correct impolite hostilities which i argue fall within the domain of emotional abuse happen in all professions and walks of life it happens to library and information science lis professionals and it most certainly happens to professionals of color and to those in the professoriate ceja alcala colon aguirre cooke  stewart  as i have progressed along the tenure track i have found this abuse to be cyclical and it does not always abate over time i have also experienced impolite hostilities to go handin hand with vague sympathies i am defining vague sympathies as the following  nebulous murmurs of im sorry youre so upset or im sorry if youre offended  rote insincere platitudes that promise things will get better and that wont happen again they also attempt to compliment by assuring that you make us look good and we value you and  weak attempts to defend and dismiss aggressive and offensive colleagues by saying they didnt mean it that way and calling them quirky or on the spectrum such labels give permission to ignore problem people and behavior vague sympathies can also come in the form of rewardsa new office an award nomination extra resources for teaching research or travel these sympathies tangible or not are used to placate and distract to calm and mollify so the status quo can continue unchallenged and uninterrupted after my first year on the tenure track i was so outraged demoralized and confused that i seriously considered leaving the academy and returning to librarianship cooke  the abuse i endured was less than subtle but i thought it was my fault and i thought it was normal thinking this is how the academy works and i just need to get used to things vague sympathies ensued and i continued on the course to tenure along the way more impolite hostilities occurred accompanied by various
impolite hostilities and vague sympathies academia as a site of cyclical abuse  rewards again i realized that perhaps academia was becoming worse but i still did not comprehend the larger context of what was happening after enduring continual physical and mental stress even being hospitalized at one point i became more vocal asking more questions and requesting transparency in the curriculum and in the organizational culture this pushback was calculated and came with great risk particularly as a pre tenure professor however this risk became negligible as i began to lose my authenticity and understanding of why i entered academia in the first place i have been called aggressive sensitive and angry predictable microaggressive dog whistles meant to discredit and silence me so why not lean into that since i had already been labeled and stereotyped i felt like there was less to lose when speaking my mind and attempting to defend myself until recently i did not have names for the things that were occurring it was not until doing interdisciplinary research for another project that i encountered clear explanations and definitions of some of the phenomena that i had endured there are a host of emotionally abusive behaviors and these could vary depending on the actors involved the three behaviors that resonated the most strongly with me are as follows  gaslighting mckinnon  which is false information presented with the intention of making victims doubt their own memory perception and sanity street smart women   minimizing hunt  which is a covert control tactic used to cause self doubt by downplaying the event its deceptively designed to manipulate a victim into feeling irrational youre overacting it wasnt that bad street smart women   silent treatment cortina  magley  duffy ganster  pagon  robinson oreilly  wang  which is a form of punishment aka control designed to cause harm by making the victim feel powerless invisible insignificant and non existent street smart women  to illustrate the three aforementioned behaviors i offer an example that represents academic bullying aggression and incivility one that has left its mark on me in the form of post traumatic stress and serious retention concerns in the summer of  i was targeted by alt rightwhite supremacist websites and bloggers who doxxed my professional contact and location information and branded me a racist for the research i do related to diversity and social justice peet  during an initial fraught period of being concerned about my physical and mental safety i was offered little support and my situation was largely ignored a year later when the administration was questioned by external parties about these events the responses ranged from i dont know anything about that to we dealt with it to it wasnt seriousto plain and painful silence silence and
 cooke denial have been the response on more than one occasion which leads me to believe that the strategy is if we ignore it it will go away this strategy is rooted in gaslighting it didnt happen minimizing it wasnt that serious and the silent treatment in the form of silent denial and in the form of purposefully ignoring and not speaking to me for periods of time as passive aggressive punishment for causing a scene what is as painful as going through a traumatic event is the abuse that accompanies it being questioned about the bullying event renewed the trauma and exacerbated the cycle of abuse interestingly enough the vague sympathies did not accompany this cycle of abuse this time i was met with excuses and defensiveness this was disappointing but it was ultimately instructive naming i firmly believe in the power of naming things in this case naming the explicit type of abuse that was occurringgaslighting minimizing and the silent treatment author and activist audre lorde cautioned readers that your silence will not protect you  p  silence does not solve or lessen the pain of abuse rather these experiences should be named reclaimed and discussed as lorde and many other authors have done explicitly defining something and seeing yourself in the literature is a validating and powerful thing cooke  unfortunately bullying and abuse in higher education are nothing new frazier  gaffney d emarco hofmeyer vessey  budin  martin  lavan  misawa  namie  tracy lutgen sandvik  alberts  and while there is substantial literature in the area across disciplines there are certainly many many more examples that have not been shared or written and definitely not published fear of retaliation is real and there are likely many who have yet to recognize identify and name the experiences they are encountering in the literature related to faculty of color and incivility bullying and abuse other topics arise such as emotional labor bellas  humiliation klein   fear cortina  magley  invisibility and hypervisibility edwards clark  bryant  vakalahi  hardin starks  roberts  smith  emotional abuse austin  estes  wang  keashly  racial battle fatigue dade tartakov hargrave  leigh  smith hung  franklin  low morale kendrick  and physical and mental stress thompson  dey  all of these topics are significant and worthy of their own treatments they are mentioned here to provide context about how nonphysical abuse can manifest in an academic environment and demonstrate the effects of this type of systemic and systematic abuse my processing and thoughts about emotional abuse in the academy particularly as it pertains to faculty of color would be remiss without a mention of intersectionality crenshaw  in her now classic theory crenshaw emphasizes that oppression can affect anyonemen women black white and so on however there are groups of people who can be
impolite hostilities and vague sympathies academia as a site of cyclical abuse  disadvantaged and discriminated against by multiple oppressions at once for example a black woman can be oppressed because of her gender and her race which makes her experiences different from that of a black man or a white woman with this framework in mind we can see that faculty of color in all disciplines face oppressions because of their gender race sexual orientation religion and so forth and for simply existing in predominantly white spaces where our countenances are not the norm we exist in spaces where were called by each others names labeled stereotyped and microaggressed and were mistaken for secretaries students custodial workersfor anyone other than full time core faculty in the tenure stream so this reflective article is not meant to minimize the experiences of non minority faculty but it is absolutely meant to highlight and emphasize the fact that faculty of color have additional things to contend with in the same spaces faculty of color are tasked with assimilation maintaining a double consciousness code switching and living with fear of retaliation and alienation on top of the already high demands of teaching research and service surviving regrettably i have yet to figure out how to dismantle the underlying causes of impolite hostilities described here but i have found a way to name share and reclaim them in the vein of audre lorde even when my experiences have been dismissed or denied lorde  p  proclaimed i have come to believe over and over again that what is most important to me must be spoken made verbal and shared even at the risk of having it bruised or misunderstood that the speaking profits me beyond any other effect to that end i offer three survival strategiestactics that have sustained me during my time in academia the first strategy has been to be the best teacher and researcher that i know how to be there is definitely pressure to produce faster and better than my white colleagues in order to prove my academic worth but the satisfaction of contributing to the literature in my field traveling the world to share my work with fellow lis professionals and having the opportunity to work with wonderful students has maintained and renewed my academic purpose my second strategy has been to cultivate and closely guard my network and relationships with mentors and peers particularly those who are also faculty of color connecting with others via social media and at conferences has been a lifeline being able to cry complain strategize and elicit support from peers who understand exactly what you are going through without explanation or justification has been validating and crucial to my well being as confirmed in henry  glenn  as have the opportunities to write and present with them
 cooke the third strategy has been to tell my story without apology counter storytelling a part of the larger critical race theory challenges us to complicate and disrupt the dominant narratives and to add our stories to the literature and to the field ender  griffin ward  phillips  smith  in this case taking the risk to tell my stories and share my experiences as a woman of color and a faculty member of color can stand in stark contrast to the dominant stories of lis which is dominated by white women these stories and those of my peers are also in contrast to the dominant narratives of higher education more g enerally counter storytelling is cathartic and often difficult as it requires the e motional labor of reliving abusive encounters and comments but it paves the way for more scholars of color to follow in our footsteps and it is an act of resistance as a dear colleague reminded me if we are going to talk about improving diversity across the profession then we need to talk about the nature of the environments we are sending these diverse folks into you cant send someone into the lions den thinking the lion is just going to let the person share his space amicably cyndee sturgis landrum personal communication january   this is why counter storytelling is necessary and important as i said in the alise panel that inspired this issue of jelis cooke et al  having a faculty member of color on staff in graduate lis programs is about more than checking a box or having a feather in your cap because you have a unicorn or rare commodity in your midst we are incredibly hard working and our experiences with and personal understanding of race diversity social justice and issues of marginalization make our brilliance shine that much brighter we deserve and expect to be retained within the academy not just recruited and then ignored andor abused lis programs have much work to do in order to be inclusive for faculty staff and students we are incredible assets to any program but we cannot and will not be abused and disregarded indefinitely nicole a cooke is an associate professor in the school of information sciences at the university of illinois urbana champaign her research and teaching interests include human information behavior particularly in the online context critical cultural information studies and diversity and social justice in librarianship with an emphasis on infusing them into lis education and pedagogy acknowledgment id like to thank my colleague cory eckert for leading me to the phrase impolite hostilities your willingness to ask hard questions is appreciated references austin r  employer abuse worker resistance and the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress stanford law review   httpsdoi org
