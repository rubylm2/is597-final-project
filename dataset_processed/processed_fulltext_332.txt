salary determination and occupational segregation among librarians nancy a van house this study identifies the determinants of librarians salaries and tests human capital based explanations of librarianship as a women profession and of intraoccupational segregation by sex within librarianship earnings functions are developed for men and women in public and academic libraries and for women in school libraries and are found to be statistically significantly different from one another personal human capital and job determinants of salaries for each group are identified the differences in the earnings functions imply different reward structures in the various types of libraries salary differences by sex within library type are decomposed and found to be due primarily to differences in individual characteristics but also to differences in the reward structures for men and women in the same type of library a major economic theory of occupational segregation supply based human capital theory is examined for its ability to explain the continuing predominance of women in the library profession and within the profession the disproportionate representation of men in academic libraries the results are mixed demand based institutional analysis is suggested as a possible alternative explanation  the data reported here are from a survey of american library association members career profile of american library association personal members performed by leigh s estabrook and kathleen m heim for the american library association committee on the status of women in librarianship with support from a bailey k howard ala goals award the analysis is based on work supported in part by the national science foundation under grant ist  any opinions findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this paper are mine and do not necessarily reflect the views of the national science foundation this paper won the  association for library and information science education alise research competition  university of california berkeley school of library and information studies berkeley california  library quarterly vol  no  pp   k  by the university of chicago all rights reserved     
salary determination  three kinds of sex differences have been observed within the library profession one is that men earn more than women    the second is that men are overrepresented in the higher level jobs relative to their numbers in the profession as a whole   the third is that men and women are distributed disproportionately across types of libraries   none of this necessarily means that there is sex discrimination within the library profession however these differences may be due to sex linked factors other than discrimination the purpose of this study is first to identify the individual characteristics that determine librarians salaries second to determine whether earnings functions differ across library types and sexes and finally to use these functions to test possible explanations for the large numbers of women in the library profession and for the disproportionate distribution of the sexes within the profession the economics of sex differences salary differences between men and women have been large and persistent although some of the difference is due to differences in earnings between men and women in the same occupation research has found that earnings differences are largely due to occupational differences that is women earn less than men on average primarily because they are in occupations that pay less  some occupations are clearly gender typed and surprisingly have remained so despite social changes over the last few years   the most segregated occupations like librarianship have remained the most stable  and the ones with the most women generally pay the least  two general economic approaches to the explanation of sex differences in the labor market exist one focusing on the employee and his or her choices or supply conditions and the other on the employer or demand conditions the most well developed models of salary and occupational distribution are supply based utilizing human capital theory the empirical research on demand based models is in its preliminary stages   the two approaches are not mutually exclusive it is likely that both demand and supply factors are at work  salary differences human capital theory contends that earnings are determined by a worker productivity which is determined in turn by his acquired character it is irrelevant to this discussion whether human capital investment improves the worker productivity or serves only as a screening device to indicate to the employer that the worker is promising  the concern here is with its influence on earnings
 the library quarterly istics such as education and experience and innate characteristics such as ability and tastes workers can enhance their productivity and therefore their earnings by investing in their human capital including formal and informal education and work experience if the characteristics that determine earnings are distributed randomly across the population then men and women earnings will not differ systematically earnings do differ by sex however which human capital theory has attempted to explain as a function of workers choices regarding the factors that determine earnings historically the major difference in men and women labor market experiences has been the extent and continuity of their labor force participation human capital theory has focused on the relationships among earnings labor force participation factors that affect participation such as parenthood and investment in human capital labor force participation is itself a form of human capital accumulation because experience increases a worker knowledge and skill in addition labor force participation helps to determine the worker investment in human capital those who plan to work fewer years will realize lesser rewards from human capital and so have less incentive to invest in it in a review of the empirical research on wage differentials donald treiman and heidi hartmann  conclude that about half of the difference in earnings between men and women has been explained by differences in education labor force experience labor force commitment or other human capital factors believed to contribute to productivity differences the remaining unexplained differential is interpreted by some as evidence of sex discrimination no method exists for measuring discrimination directly so the usual approach has been to explain as much as possible of the difference in salaries using individuals productivityrelated characteristics with the unexplained sex linked residual used to estimate the effect of sex discrimination for example   occupational distibution jobs consist of clusters of characteristics including salary fringe benefits working conditions the character of the tasks performed and intrinsic and extrinsic rewards human capital theory asserts that a rational decision maker chooses among closely related occupations with the goal of maximizing expected benefits research has focused particularly on the effect on occupational choice of expected lifetime income a measurable objective benefit for example  an individual expected lifetime income in a given occupation depends on its reward structure and on his innate and acquired characteristics and career pattern the difference in labor force participation between men and women
salary determination  has also been proposed as a major determinant of occupational distribution polachek    hypothesized that people who expect career interruptions choose occupations where the rewards for continuous participation andor the penalties for interruption are the least such occupations willtherefore tend to attract women polachek demonstrated that women who spent the most time out of the labor force during their working years were most likely to be in the occupations in which implicit wage losses for women with intermittent labor force participation were the least other research however has disputed these findings    research on the library labor market research in librarianship has examined salary differences by sex among librarians but has not explicitly addressed the reasons for either the continuing predominance of women in the library profession or the disproportionate distribution of men and women among types of libraries two studies have used multivariate methods to explain salary differences by sex among librarians in  kathleen heim and leigh estabrook  surveyed a sample of american library association ala members they related librarians sex status salaries career patterns and a range of personal and demographic factors they performed two salary regressions one each for academic and public librarians with sex entered as an independent variable the assumption underlying this approach is that sex is a determinant of salaries but that the coefficients of the other variables do not differ by sex within library type sex was significant in each regression other variables that were significant for both public and academic librarians were date of birth and of mls leave time taken number of publications number of professionals supervised and level in the organizational hierarchy for public librarians size of organization and number of nonprofessionals supervised were significant as well w s siebert and a young  used a human capital model to test the importance of market discrimination and family role factors in salary differences among male and female librarians in great britain using data from a sample of employed british library association members they developed separate earnings functions for married and single men and women and for married men and women with and without children and compared them to test the effect of sex marital status and children on earnings for single men and women the earnings functions were not statistically significantly different and sex was not a significant variable in a combined regression single women earned more than
 the library quarterly married women with the same characteristics but married men earned more than single men having children increased married men earnings but reduced married women siebert and young concluded that such discrimination as may have existed among british librarians was more tied to family and children than to sex the effect of parenthood suggested to them a productivity based explanation of earnings differences men with children were more highly motivated financially while women with children perhaps placed less emphasis on their work another study of sex differences in librarianship by nancy van house  compared the social and private returns to the investment in an mls degree for men and women all were negative that is the mls degree did not generate enough additional income to balance its cost but the returns were worse for men than for women given men greater earnings in nonlibrary occupations she suggested that this may contribute to the continued predominance of women in the profession librarianship is a poorer investment for men than for women one might argue that these findings imply that librarians are unconcerned with income another study by van house  however found that the number of mls graduates is a function of starting salaries indicating that potential librarians do consider income in making career choices the two sets of findings are consistent if one considers that work yields both monetary and nonmonetary rewards within an occupation holding constant its nonmonetary rewards total benefits will change with salary but in comparing occupations the individual may trade off monetary and nonmonetary benefits choosing librarianship despite its smaller economic returns because of its greater for that individual nonmonetary rewards the subject remains a utility maximizer with salary as one component of utility the present study this study develops a human capital model of the determinants of librarians salaries by sex and type of library tests the ability of human capital theory to explain why the majority of librarians continues to be women and tests a human capital based explanation of the differences in the distributions of men and women among types of libraries human capital theory is widely accepted as a basis for earnings functions  it is more controversial as a basis for explaining occupational differences by sex  but remains the leading economic theory in this area the present study therefore is significant on two grounds for what it reveals about the library profession in light of current economic theory and methods and as a test of the ability of human capital theory

salary determination  discussion earnings determinants librarians salaries depend on professional experience and job responsibilities human capital investment and job related variables play a lesser role life cycle variables including family situation and mobility limits have virtually no effect exactly which variables are significant and the size of their coefficients differ across library types and by sex within type the earnings function for men in academic libraries shows the greatest effects from human capital and job achievement variables that of women in school libraries the least the earnings functions of women in academic and public libraries are similar to one another and different from those of their male co workers despite the differences in earnings functions much  percent of the difference in salary between men and women within public libraries can be explained by employee characteristics within academic libraries less  percent of the difference is explainable it is dangerous to attribute the unexplained residual to discrimination however to the extent that it is due to other factors not included in the regression the residual overstates the effects of discrimination to the extent that the explanatory factors included in the regressions are themselves the result of discrimination it understates it what can be concluded is that much but not all of the difference in men and women salaries can be explained by the factors included and that in academic libraries in particular a fairly large unexplained difference remains men can expect to earn more in academic than in public libraries ceteris paribus for women no significant difference by type of library can be concluded occupational segregation and librarianship the results provide mixed support for the hypotheses developed from human capital theory to explain the large numbers of women in the library profession  contrary to expectations the women in this sample show a low incidence of the factors likely to promote career interruptions marriage children and mobility limits instead strikingly large proportions of these women are not married andor are childless without comparable data for other professions it is impossible to say whether librarians spend an exceptional amount of time out of the labor market but it appears unlikely  as expected librarians earnings functions show no depreciation loss in earnings power for time out of the labor force and no penalties
 the library quarterly for mobility limits and family responsibilities and only academic men earnings show significant returns to other forms of human capital investment but contrary to expectations earnings do show appreciation increase in earnings with experience these findings are especially significant because of the prevalence of the human capital explanation for occupational segregation and the lack of empirical tests of it at this level of occupational detail intraoccupational segregation within librarianship research within an occupation may be a better test of theories of labor market outcomes because people within an occupation are more similar in tastes abilities and opportunities than those in different occupations within librarianship the human capital approach leads one to expect the types of libraries to differ in their suitability for interrupted careers the findings again are mixed  the propensity of librarians within a type of library to interrupt their careers does not appear to be related to the representation of men in that sector  women in the different sectors vary little female school librarians are about as likely to interrupt their careers as others although they do spend more time on leave and are slightly more likely to be married than other women librarians  however earnings functions by library type are related to the proportion of men in that sector academic librarians earnings especially men show the greatest returns to experience and to other forms of investment and school librarians the least the tendency of male librarians to go into academic libraries can be explained in part by the earnings functions since men earn more in academic than in public libraries controlling for employee characteristics it is rational for men to prefer academic to public libraries since women earn about the same in public and academic libraries they have less economic reason to prefer one to the other school libraries are different from other types of libraries not only in their salary functions but also in the kind of work performed and working conditions often including a nine month year making them less directly comparable to the others the conclusion to be drawn from this is that while there are differences in reward structures across library types they provide only partial support for the human capital explanation of the distribution of men and women within librarianship or between librarianship and other occupations what is striking about these data is that the earnings functions for academic men and school women seem to be at opposite ends of the continuum the independent variables tested have the most impact on academic men salaries and the least on school women
salary determination  alternative explanations if human capital theory cannot satisfactorily explain occupational and intraoccupational segregation of librarians what can the prevailing alternative theory is demand based institutional analysis a definitive empirical comparison of institutional analysis and human capital theory is not possible within the limits of these data and the current state of research on demand based theories but some observations can be made institutional models shift the emphasis from the individual to the structure of labor markets and the way in which people are assigned to jobs segmented labor market analysis  postulates the existence of at least two labor market segments a primary segment where the worker skills are important to the production process and a secondary one where they are not in the primary market a large part of the worker skill is firm specific and so a firm will hire workers who are expected to have low turnover will provide good pay benefits and working conditions to keep them and will invest in their training the primary sphere is characterized by few entry points and by an internal labor market that governs promotions and relative salaries limits the extent to which the employer can differentiate among people performing the same work and creates a relatively rigid relationship among occupational categories employers can differentiate among people primarily in hiring and job assignment once people are in jobs the employer is less likely to treat employees differently the more preferred workers gain access to the primary market other workers are left to the secondary sphere where worker skill is less important and continuity is not a goal it has high turnover many entry points low salaries and few opportunities for training or for advancement an alternative institutional model has been proposed by francine blau  blau found evidence of an interfirm wage hierarchy that is relatively fixed and consistent across occupations she suggested that firms paying high salaries to all their employees would have an excess supply of potential employees from which to choose and could be highly selective firms lower in the wage hierarchy would be less able to be selective within the firm differences among workers performing the same work would be minimal owing to the internal labor market that governs promotions and relative salaries blau found evidence that there were more men in firms that paid higher salaries and that within firms differences in salary by sex were much less than those across firms segmented labor markets do not necessarily lead to discrimination the question of how employees are assigned to the different segments remains the theory of segmented labor markets was developed to explain labor market differences by sex and race however and the
 the library quarterly traditional women professions of teaching and nursing have the characteristics of a secondary labor market  the different types of libraries may constitute different labor market segments whose boundaries are difficult to cross so that once a librarian enters a sector she finds it difficult to change even if jobs in another sector look more tempting librarians changing jobs generally stay within the same type of library  their skills are more readily transferable within than across sectors workers and employers are better able to compare jobs skill levels and salaries within library type both because jobs and worker characteristics are more similar within similar libraries and because people have better information given the distribution of men and women in the different types of libraries if it is true that women professions tend to be more like a secondary market and if the different types of libraries constitute different labor market segments within the profession then segmented labor market models would lead one to expect school libraries to be the most like a secondary market with low salaries and low rewards for investment in human capital and job advancement academic libraries would be the most like a primary segment with high salaries and high returns to investment in human capital and job advancement this is indeed roughly the case although the differences between male and female academic librarians are greater than one would expect and the differences between women in public and academic libraries less it is almost as though male and female librarians were operating in different segments for women the differences between public and academic libraries are much less than for men both supplyand demand based explanations lead one to expect differences in salary structures between male and female occupations and suboccupations with more men in the sectors with higher rewards for acquired characteristics like human capital investment and job achievement and greater penalties for discontinuous labor force attachment this is indeed the case with librarianship a major difference between supplyand demand based theories is in the role of worker characteristics because supply based models attribute differences in labor market outcomes to differences in worker characteristics especially labor market attachment they posit greater differences in individuals characteristics than demand based models where differences are due more to the group to which an employee belongs than to his or her own attributes the differences in family circumstances mobility limits and leave taking among the women in this sample are very small leading one to doubt the validity of supply based explanations the differences among the reward structures in the different types of libraries are in keeping with demand based explanations
salary determination  limits of the study this study has utilized an economic approach to sex differences in the library profession other approaches especially the sociological approach are also necessary to complete the picture this study is limited in its generalizability by the nature of the sample members of the ala self selected by their willingness and ability to pay a membership fee and no doubt by other characteristics as well the sample is probably older and more professionally active and accomplished than the library profession as a whole although this is a serious limitation comparable data for the profession as a whole do not exist the study is also limited by the data available all information is selfreported the data are cross sectional the categorical nature of the dependent variable makes it difficult to track rates of change only certain variables were available for the analysis several indexes for example of professional activity and of education were constructed the study would have been enhanced by more variable and continuous information for example years of additional education the above analysis assumes that the models have been correctly specified and that the variables have been correctly conceptualized operationalized and measured as is always the case it is impossible to say that all these conditions have been fulfilled perfectly to the extent that any of these conditions are not met the results must be viewed with caution another limitation is that the only measure of benefits that has been used is salary fringe benefits could not be included however on average these do not differ much across types of libraries  undoubtedly other factors such as working conditions prestige and the nature of the work itself are important to librarians these other factors differ less within than across occupations other research in this area which has also attempted to explain occupational choice using salaries has compared unlike occupations furthermore previous research  has shown that salary does play a role in librarians occupational choice clearly it is not the only factor but it is one that does have validity in explaining aggregate behavior conclusions this study has used economic theory and methods to identify the determinants of librarians salaries to test for differences in salary functions across types of libraries and sexes and to explain the large numbers of
 the library quarterly women in the profession and the differences in the relative numbers of men and women in the different types of libraries one major result of this study is the development of earnings functions by type of libra ry and sex librarians earnings are determined largely by experience and job achievement somewhat by other forms of human capital investment and hardly at all by life cycle variables exactly which of these factors are significant and their effects on earnings differ across types of libraries and within type by sex female school librarians are rewarded the least for investment and occupational achievement male academic librarians earn the most and their salaries are the most sensitive to human capital and job achievement men salaries in academic and public libraries differ significantly women much less so another significant result of this study is its demonstration that much of the observed difference in men and women salaries can be explained by worker characteristics and the type of library in which a subject is employed the unexplained residual difference in public and especially academic salaries cannot safely be attributed to discrimination but does leave the question open this study has also attempted to shed some light on the important question of why some occupations including librarianship are populated largely by women the prevailing approach in economics is human capital theory librarianship however fits only partially the portrait of a female typed occupation painted by human capital theory the reward structures are basically as predicted with low penalties for career interruptions and family responsibilities but the women within the profession do not appear to be predisposed toward career interruptions large numbers are unmarried andor childless and few have taken leaves one could argue that they picked this profession planning an interrupted career that did not materialize but only behavior not plans are represented in the data within librarianship the differences in earnings functions explain in part the large numbers of men in academic libraries for men academic libraries are the more remunerative alternative what is not explained is why this is so why men are in more responsible positions and why they benefit more from improvements in salary related characteristics than do women in the same work setting the earnings functions in the different types of libraries differ in the directions predicted by both human capital theory and institutional analysis but the lack of the expected differences in the personal characteristics of librarians raises serious questions about human capital theory as the sole explanation of intraoccupational distribution institutional
salary determination  analysis appears to have potential as an explanation of intraoccupational segregation in libraries the mixed findings regarding intraoccupational segregation are not surprising the literature on occupational segregation is itself inconclusive at this point in librarianship as in the occupational segregation literature generally both supply and demand factors appear to be important the institutional approach however merits more research additional research needs to be carried out using a true cross section of library professionals ala members are probably not fully representative of their colleagues in particular the school librarians in this sample appear to be drawn from the higher ranking positions furthermore this sample was limited to librarians in only three work settings and in one of those settings only to women it would also be instructive to compare librarians with individuals in similar occupations other female typed professions for example to see to what extent these findings are unique to librarians or true of other women professions as well finally it would be instructive to be able to include rewards other than salary in occupational selection references  estabrook leigh s and heim kathleen m a profile of ala personal members american libraries  december     heim kathleen m and estabrook leigh s career profiles and sex discnrmination in the library profession chicago american library association   martin jean k salary and position levels of females and males in academic libraries in the status of women in libranranship historical sociologzcal and economic issues edited by kathleen heim new york neal schuman publishers   swisher robert and du mont rosemary ruhig sex structuring in academic libraries searching for explanations library quarterly  april     king research inc library human resources a study of supply and demand chicago american library association   american library association office for library personnel resources the racial ethnic and sexual composition of library staff in academic and public libranres chicago american library association   treiman donald j and hartmann heidi l eds women work and wages equal pay for jobs of equal value washington dc national academy press   beller andrea h occupational segregation by sex determinants and changes journal of human resources  summer     blau francine d and hendricks wallace e occupational segregation by sex trends and prospects journal of human resources  spring     meyer peterj and maes patricia l the reproduction of occupational segregation among young women industrial relations  winter     blau francine d discrimination against women theory and evidence in labor economics modern views edited by william darityjr boston kluwer nijhoff publishing
