introduction this article addresses the everyday information worlds of millennials or generation ytodays preteens or tweens between the ages of  and and how these worlds can be mediated effectively by youth service professionals based on an emergent framework what began as an exploratory inquiry of why tweens turn to other people for everyday information that is interpersonal informationseeking developed into a deeper investigation of a how this age group differs empirically from adjacent populations children and young adults regarding its information behavior ib particularly for everydaylife situations and b how millennials defining characteristics which bolster their information worlds suggest principles upon which focused youth services can be based in addition to library and information science lis the nature and needs of youth have been of interest to researchers and professionals in several fields notably education psychology sociology and social work with each predictably contributing domainspecific insights for lis these insights have largely focused on school and public library services regarding scholastic needs and information literacy scant research has examined minors ib either within or outside of the classroom for nonschoolrelated situations the irony here is that by nature tweens particularly the millennial generation are undergoing significant physical emotional and cognitive development during an era of unprecedented social change and technological advancement library services however still focus predominantly on curriculardriven homework assistance and reading advocacy examples of promoting technical literacy are increasing as public libraries in particular engage in providing public access computing services largely due to investment by the bill and melinda gates foundation   we note with caution however that technical fluency is not the same as information literacy nor does unmediated access to technology negate the need for information services our research thus calls for and proposes a framework that begins to address the need for an expanded youth services agenda that empowers tweens to develop and flourish in an increasingly complex world following a brief review of studies of everydaylife ib and youth we draw on the developmental theory of lev vygotsky   to suggest a social practice lens for examining the way that tweens engage in interpersonal informationseeking the tween day methodology is then introduced followed by the findings from our exploratory qualitative study of tweens we conclude by presenting our framework for basing future information services to this population the myth of the digital native as a prelude to reviewing how adolescents have been studied in lis it may be helpful to chart the plethora of terms used to describe young informationseekers most notably the most recent moniker of the digital native among these are youth young adults early adults teenagers preteens tweens tweeners and tweenies with each generation having its own name or extension to mark its uniqueness from otherswitness boomers and late boomers generation x and now generation y also known as the millennials the net generation and the google generation these marking the first waves of digital natives but are they truly digital natives the term was coined by technologist marc prensky   to describe youth born after  who because of their immersion in interactive mediarich technologies such as the internet and the web since birth think and process information fundamentally differently from their predecessors  p  the implications of this brave new beginning do not necessarily make digital natives easytoserve users richard sweeny  describes them as impatient multitasking highly demanding experimental and experiential adding that they have different attitudes and expectations toward research and different skills and literacies although this assertion is supported anecdotally eg  empirical research describing qualitative differences in student cognition based on longitudinal analysis is lacking particularly outside the united states the upshot is that as millennials enter college and as technologies further permeate the educational context and broader geosocial world educators and librarians struggle to understand and adapt to these digital scholars yet arguments may be made at least until hard science shows otherwise that youth remain the same despite the pathways afforded by evolving technologies the physical affective and social contexts that shape ones information worlds are constant such is the rationale for why the stories of beverly clearys characters have never gone out of print after fifty years the high level needs experienced by youth the needs to turn to a peer for information emotional support and identity confirmation do not changeone can arguewhether one is growing up in new york city in the s or in port orchard washington in  moreover not all youth today not in the united states and certainly not worldwide are growing up digital as great efforts remain to be undertaken at promoting digital inclusion  as we show in the following review of the literature regarding the everyday information behavior of youth following vygotskys work development together with findings from our empirical research tweens may be best served through a holistic practice model that accounts for their broadbased social affective and physical needs surrounding information youth and everydaylife informationseeking ross todd  p  in his review of adolescent informationseeking and use identifies three strands of research in the general area of youth information behavior  school students learning through the school library  children and adolescents and the world wide web and  children and adolescents and everyday informationseeking it is this third area that concerns how children seek and use information for meeting their developmental needs investigating career and lifestyle choices and building relationships with friends and family members while of critical importance to children as they grow up everydaylife informationseeking is by far the least studied of these three research strands with few exceptions these studies have focused on teenagers a population with significantly greater autonomy and mobility than preteens and thus greater capacity for creating and using social networks that might facilitate interpersonal information behaviors while only two of the studies elaborated on below cover youth between the ages of  and    we find them all significant for their approach to everyday informationseeking from the perspective of youth in contrast older studies tended to portray youth from the point of view of adult service providers in their work on project cate childrens access to and use of technology evaluation eliza dresang melissa gross and leslie holt  see also  examined the library behaviors of preteen youth including three focus groups with children aged  and their observations of library activity focused on technology and computer access they found that children of this age male and female often choose to work together in contrast to the one child per computer paradigm common in many schools and information service environments childrens informationseeking and information use was decidedly social and their desire for social technologies was further reinforced by the desire for facetoface informationsharing venues furthermore these researchers found that preteens suggestions regarding the design of information services could increase the effectiveness of information spaces such as the public library andrew shenton and patricia dixon  found that youngsters of all ages turn to adults and peers for information conducting focus groups and interviews with  students aged  in a rural town in great britain they revealed a typology of thirteen different information needs advice spontaneous life situation information personal information affective support empathetic understanding support for skills development schoolrelated subject information interestdriven information selfdevelopment information preparatory information reinterpretations and supplementations and verification information the study further identified that some young people take three general social types into consideration when selecting persons to consult about an information need  people of convenience  friends or peers of comparable experience and  experts such as teachers teachers and librarians were cast as negative social types by some students who were loathe to approach them for particular information needs unfortunately shenton and dixons typology fails to distinguish information needs developmentally or to enumerate qualitative differences in strategies among the developmental periods of childhood preteen and teen studying the everydaylife needs of older youth denise agosto and sandra hugheshassell  performed semistructured group interviews with twentyseven urban teens aged  in two philadelphia venues to identify their information needs sources and preferred media using reijo savoleinins  elis framework they reported that teens identified friends and family as their preferred information sources and cell phones as their most preferred method of toolmediated communication top noninterpersonal sources were the telephone television school and the internet a typology of their needs listed schoolwork timedate social life and weather as their primary information needs furthermore these teens were highly skeptical of libraries and books as sources of everyday information casting library staff as negative social types kathy latrobe and william havener  studied eighteen teens  years old in an eleventh grade honors math course through surveys and individual interviews they reported that teens were most in need of courserelated information but that they also sought information on relationships work future plans recreation health and lifestyles all students reported using teachers peers and courserelated materials to fulfill their information needs developing socially vygotskian theory and lis the rising social constructivist metaphor stands in contrast to traditional approaches to lis research which focused on individuals their information needs and independent seeking strategies   while studies of youth ib have found that informationseeking supports the developing social self eg    informationseeking among youth has not been situated as a social practice the current study goes one step further in not only recognizing social manifestations of ib but also suggesting a social ontogenesis of that behavior in youth agosto and hugheshassels  study of urban teens for example appears to understate the critical importance of social factors in the development of young adults they present a theoretical and empirical model of the urban teenager incorporating seven aspects of the developing self while their model situates the social self equally among six other areas including the emotional reflective physical creative cognitive and sexual selves their qualitative data suggest that the social self is the crux and driving force behind these other aspects the sexual self for example is discovered explored and actualized only in relation to other people anthony bernier reminds us in a recent collection of youth informationseeking behavior research like it or not all adolescent literacy acts come embedded in social contexts  p xviii the social constructivist metaphor is based in the developmental theory of vygotsky developed and refined in theories of situated action and learning see also   vygotsky   conceived of adolescence as a critical period in the development of childrens mental and social functioning qualitative changes in social development and meaningmaking define this period preteens begin to think conceptually and to take steps toward the formation of higher mental processes they also begin to grasp their own personality the outward reality that surrounds them and the self in relation to broader social structures tweens can conceptualize activity and its consequences through reflection and metacognition that younger children cannot   conceptions of morality develop although moral concepts and behavior may not be aligned the issue of fairness becomes paramount as preteens become cognizant of the choices that others make with regard to their lives more complex relationships among preteens their peers and adults drive this process forward this is similar to the stage that jean piaget  defines as formal operations the emphasis on relationships distinguishes vygotskys work from that of his contemporary piaget who presented stages that were predetermined and highly internalized vygotsky writes human learning presupposes a specific social nature and process by which children grow into the intellectual life of those around them  p  james wertsch  outlines three major themes in vygotskys social formation of the mind first the internal activities of individuals can be understood within a broader social context cognitive activity occurs first on the social plane and it is then internalized by the individual this is important in considering the diverse ways in which children evaluate information and information sources the social and cultural context of childrens informationseeking influences what is important to know as well as how it is sought and known  second learning is facilitated by more capable peers or more knowledgeable members of a cultural group this is the concept of a zone of proximal development or zpd which vygotsky defines as the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers  p  several lis researchers have identified or utilized the zpd as a frame for studying childrens ib linda cooper  identified the role that adults play in the grazing and search processes of sevenyearolds carol kuhlthau  modeled her zone of intervention after vygotskys zpdthis zone in the search process is the area in which an information user can do with advice and assistance what he or she cannot do alone or can do only with great difficulty  p  lynne mckechnies  work with young children in the public library found a similar mediating role in the process of picturebook browsing these researchers found that adults can be supportive and provide confidence and validation to children even when they do not provide technical assistance with the search adults are thus seen as scaffolding the ib of young people  this notion has been empirically tested with students and mediating information professionals but not in an everyday context of interpersonal informationseeking questions still remain regarding the role that peer and adult relationships play in preteen interpersonal information processes particularly those that occur outside the professional mediation of teachers and librarians third activity is mediated by tools and symbols particularly psychological tools language being the tool of tools but also including different media technologies and places that facilitate social interaction and meaningmaking informal space as a tool for facilitating informationsharing among preteens has been largely unexplored this is a particularly important point when considering the constraints that youth encounter in their daily activities including informationseeking michael cole and yrjö engestrom  posit that to fully understand an activity such as informationseeking one must address how these artifacts mediate activity situated within a cultural context as children transition to adulthood how others mediate their activities changes considerably tweens are in a period of development during which they are drawn to closer association with their peers and start to pull away from the previously comforting and secure relationships with parents and other adults they idolize the activities of teens but are limited in their participation by a number of constraints including mobility and authority the current study thus proceeded from the assumption that preteens being distinct from younger children and older teens in several ways will also have different information needs strategies and mediations the current study our investigation of the everyday information behavior of tweens children aged  is part of a larger study entitled talking with you exploring interpersonal informationseeking which is funded by the national science foundation this larger study focuses specifically on why people turn to other people for everyday information ranging from finding new jobs and lower mortgages to health care housing child care social activities and other aspects of daily life from over thirty populations tweens were specifically chosen for their conceptual interest it was hypothesized that rich insights would be obtained from a population that has been nurtured from birth to seek information interpersonally and that is at a life juncture of becoming independent from the adultoriented familyschool structure but that also is marked as societys most technologically savvy generation it was further hypothesized that tweens would engage in mediarich interpersonal informationseeking behavior using all available synchronous and asynchronous media eg facetoface telephone email web pages instant messaging forums blogs and wikis the research was informed by several information and everydaylife theories including brenda dervins sensemaking   elfreda chatmans normative behavior  and karen fishers information grounds  as well as the principles of everyday information behavior discussed by roma harris and patricia dewdney  and donald case  sensemaking providing the base notes for the larger study of why people turn to other people for information was pivotal in identifying the main concepts of interest that is information needsgaps informationseeking strategies barriers uses and outcomes the micromoment interview technique was used to structure the exit interviews with the tweens chatmans work was key on several levels beginning with her orienting concept of small worlds borrowed from sociologists alfred schutz and thomas luckmann  and manfred kochen  she defined a small world as one in which everyday happenings occur with some degree of predictability and where legitimized others share conceptual and physical space and thus shape social norms around information and other behaviors  p  as explained in her  keynote address at the information seeking in context conference in sweden her research prompted development of three related frameworks for explaining everydaylife information behavior the theory of information poverty the theory of life in the round and the theory of normative behavior in simplest form these frameworks can be considered as progressing from a small world in which informationsharing is not conducted openly and in a healthy regard but rather is highly secretive and hoarding in manner due to a paucity and high cost of information information poverty to a mixed openclosed environment where whether an individual seeks avoids or shares information depends on circumstances marked by large degrees of imprecision life in the round to an open healthy setting where informationseeking is viewed as a normal activity except under unusual circumstances that are caused by behavior sanctioned by the group life in the norm key themes running across chatmans body of work include social types social norms and worldview we hypothesized that the small worlds concept together with the theory of normative behavior would best fit or help in our understanding of the everyday information lives of tweens our working expectation was that the tweens occupied or lived in small worlds in which informationseeking was essentially viewed as a healthy activity by its membersthe tweens their families peers teachers and others the general principles of informationseeking described by harris and dewdney  and case  were particularly useful for designing the data collection instruments and data analysis albeit with the caveat that they were largely drawn from research on adult populations in barriers to information  pp  harris and dewdney integrated previous research to develop six general principles of informationseeking behavior they interpreted these generalizations to apply to ordinary people of which we would include tweens the principles are these  information needs arise from the helpseekers situation  the decision to seek help or not seek help is affected by many factors  people tend to seek information that is most accessible  people tend to first seek help or information from interpersonal sources especially from people like themselves  informationseekers expect emotional support  people follow habitual patterns in seeking information we integrated these principles with the lessons derived from case  in his extensive survey of information needs seeking and use research thus an aim of the current study was to learn whether the principles we draw from the research of adult information behavior were relevant to the tween population recognizing that informationseeking is a complex phenomenon involving an interplay of personal and contextual variables the researchers developed the following research questions rqs to guide the study  what types of everyday information do tweens perceive themselves as needing  how do tweens seek everyday information  what barriers do tweens encounter in seeking and using information  how do tweens manage their accumulated everyday information  what criteria do tweens use in assessing and sharing information and information sources  what roles are played by different social types regarding information flow  what are the roles of information grounds in tweens lives the research questions were wideranging and inclusive but consistent with prior research on everydaylife informationseeking and information grounds  the researchers sought to gather information that would expand our understanding of how preteens experience informationseeking including processes outcomes and affective dimensions method researchers must balance the cognitive affective social and sensorimotor needs of youth informants with the demands of collecting rigorous highquality and minimally biased data in response to this challenge the research team developed the tween day methodology a fivehour research play date combining social interaction creative play and multiple data collection methods the agenda included carefully selected and structured activities that would meet the developmental needs of our target population while allowing the collection of a rich data set beyond triangulating data through the use of multiple methods which is a common qualitative approach the type and order of activities were selected  to engage and stimulate tween participants  to provide an array of interactions with adult researchers and peers  to promote a sense of empowerment and achievement the focus of our research design was moving from the traditional perspective of doing research on youth to doing research with youth table  illustrates the different elements of the research program and how they supported the developmental needs of tween participants as identified in the youth services philosophy of patrick jones  the researchers felt that this service philosophy was consistent with the developmental theory used to guide this research and that it helped frame research activities in terms of youthcentered outcomes the procedural elements are divided into four categories child protection schedule design data collection and incentives

created a schedule to facilitate physical activity and positive social interaction keeping the students moving and engaged through regular activity change was essential to preventing boredom and fatigue as well as impolite aggressive or disruptive behavior  data collection multiple methods of data collection were employed to triangulate data permit different types of interaction among tweens and adults and play to the different strengths of individual participants focus groups of from four to six preteens individual interviews and a labbased webquest activity afforded creative expression and collaboration with other tweens and adults  incentives and recognition the researchers provided two levels of recognition to tweens gifts that served as a measure of appreciation for their participation and personalized certificates that demonstrated the importance of their contribution to the research effort both were meant to afford a sense of meaningful participation and achievement during focus group  the tweens were given the scenario of a new kid of their age moving to their neighborhood the tweens were asked to describe what everyday life would be like for the new tween and what types of things she or he would need to know then the tweens were asked to discuss how the following information sources would be used  peers with whom the tween is close  peers with whom the tween is not close  adults with whom the tween is close mainly family teachers  adults with whom the tween is not close  web sites  television  books and magazines focus group  ended with the tweens identifying the information grounds that their new neighbor might utilize as explained by karen fisher and charles naumer  information grounds are social settings where people go for a particular purposeactivity eg to get a bike fixed to get a haircut to eat or to play a sport but wind up sharing information in the course of interacting with other people during focus group  the tweens were asked to expand on the information grounds previously identified in terms of how frequently one would go there who else would be present what one would talk about what one liked about it and so forth tweens were also asked to explain under what circumstances the sources discussed in focus group  would not be used to seek information in the individual interviews tweens were asked to recount a recent incident in which they sought nonschoolrelated information as well as a time when they shared nonschoolrelated information with someone the recounts were based on dervins  sensemaking micromoment time line approach the tweens were also asked to explain how they manage or keep track of all the everyday information that they pick uppersonal information management is a key area of research interest across all populations and little is known about the practices of youth as most efforts have focused on work domains   to end the interviews the tweens were asked to explain why they agreed or disagreed with ten generalizations regarding tweens and information that were purposively designed to be thoughtprovoking for example tweens were asked to respond to the statement parents can answer any question a preteen might have study samples three iterations of tween day were completed by the research team with three unique tween samples the locations chosen were a university campus in the city hereafter university a faithbased ministry in a culturally diverse urban neighborhood ministry and an elementary school in a middleclass suburb twenty miles from the city school in total thirtyfour tweens participated sixteen at university ten females and six males average age  years five at the ministry two females and three males average age  years and thirteen at the school seven females and six males average age  years the university tweens were caucasian the ministry tweens were african american and the school tweens were a mix of caucasian african american native american and asianpacific islander although the participants were recruited conveniently at each location the combined sample of thirtyfour tweens represented a diverse range of socioeconomic and ethnic groups one roughly equivalent to the studys geographic region which was broadly situated in a large urbansuburban area with a population in excess of  million data analysis by systematically collecting data from three sites using identical instruments protocols and time frames the research team was able to perform a thorough crosssite analysis of the qualitative data all data collected were rigorously checked for validity to ensure trustworthiness we implemented several measures as recommended by yvonne lincoln and egon guba  dependability or reliability was ensured through  consistent notetaking and the use of multiple researchers  using multiple triangulated methods  comparing emergent themes with findings from related studies  audiotaping and transcribing interviews  employing intercoder checks  analyzing the data for incidents of observer effect we addressed different forms of validity as follows  face validity asked whether observations fit an expected or plausible frame of reference  criterioninternal validity  pretesting instruments  peer debriefing and  participant verification ie member checks  construct validity examined data with respect to the various theoretical constructs represented in the literature and pertinent to different aspects of the study eg information grounds the qualitative data set was analyzed using a set of coding techniques memos and research team conversations major themes emerged from the data which at a high level guided the analysis and permitted the team to break an enormous data set into manageable portions these themes eg information grounds social types affect and information needs or firstlevel codes were mapped onto the instruments questions to create thematic sets that could be analyzed using iterative patterncoding techniques the researchers utilized the coding and querying features of atlas ti  knowledge workbench inc to parse the data into these thematic sets repeated reading of the interview transcripts memos and group discussions allowed the researchers to identify patterns secondlevel codes of behavior within these sets some patterns appeared in multiple themes which permitted thematic bridging select questions that provided particularly rich data were further analyzed independent of the themes using thirdlevel coding schemes specific to those smaller analytic sets the complete methodology including instruments and techniques is explained in detail in meyers fisher and marcoux  the resulting data amassed from fourteen focus groups and twentyfive interviews were analyzed using the aforementioned frameworks and principles yielding unique insights into the information worlds of tweens and its social affective and cognitive dimensions findings the findings presented below are organized by the research questions posed earlier in this article these questions represent the various dimensions of informationseeking experience we explored with tweens ranging from how their information needs emerge to the processes of seeking information including how when and where to techniques and tools they use to share and organize the results of their search in each of these dimensions we find that social and affective factors were salient if not critical to both the process and outcome rq  what types of everyday information do tweens perceive themselves as needing information needs is a topic commonly explored in the research on information behavior we sought to explore whether tweens with access to a greater array of information sources and formats than children had just fifteen years ago may have everydaylife information needs that are unique as compared to those of older populations as well as compared to those documented in earlier schoolbased research on students needs in focus groups tweens explained the common types of information needs they experience in their everyday life the tweens most commonly reported information needs concerned concrete immediate or shortterm goals and activities rather than longrange needs eg career choices these included school work social events and relationships sports and hobbies consumer information fashion and popular culture neighborhood information and stuffa ubiquitous term used to describe the object of spontaneous undirected informationsharing as in stuff that went on at school stuff that you found on the internet and stuff like movies or where to get the latest video games the urban ministry tweens differed in their concerns from the two suburban groups school and university when asked what local information tweens needed the ministry group included how to deal with bullies dangerous strangers drug and alcohol users and unsafe places for example one tween in a focus group reports if youre about to get into a fight like how to react how to refuse it and not make people think youre like a wimp when you refuse it although the urban ministry tweens shared concerns and needs with the other groups these particular concerns stood out for them all of the tweens stressed the need to share and receive private or secret informationan intrinsic part of social information exchange the ability to keep secrets ranging from everyday news to more juicy topics such as quarrels or crushes was an important part of friendship evaluation and trust the need for privacyand the ability to trust peersseemed to be the driving force in interpersonal informationsharing facetoface communication was usually preferred over other forms even if it required traveling or waiting until friends could meet at school or at some other social spot a prime example of private or confidential information included the following you tell stuff like if someones being mean to you or you dont like somebody and like got mad at them or if you got in a fight with somebody the tweens had strong ideas of who could be trusted with certain kinds of information needs trust was a quality generally established through tenure and extended contact if you get to know someone for a school year its considered your friend you could tell them secrets  the first day of school when you go into a new class if you see somebody who you think would be nice you cant start telling them all your secrets tweens also suggested that they kept their ib separate from parents and other adults as the following tween explained my dad hes always trying to get into my lifelike what happened at school if my sister and i are talking about who we like and stuff my dads like oh who this person like hes gonna get into our lives   quotes from individual interviews are attributed to the tween with the study sample in parentheses eg kylie school quotes without attribution are derived from focus groups sessions all tween names used in this article are pseudonyms tweens were permitted to select their own pseudonyms hence mr blackwood and mr henderson rq  how do tweens seek everyday information from an initial exploration of student needs the research focused broadly on strategies and sources of information including interpersonal print and digital sources rather than focusing on a specific kind of informationseeking or source eg how children use a common web search engine or resource we focused on childrens information problemshow they turned their needs into usable answers and solutions their seeking behavior then included a wide range of sources and search moves interpersonal peer sources were highly salient as tweens regularly consulted other tweens early in the informationseeking process sometimes the advice of a peer or adult was sought in selecting an information sourcea recommenderwhen a need arose interpersonal informationsharing was enhanced by telephones instant messaging im and email for those who had access which enabled tweens to share information in the evening if they lived in different neighborhoods tweens with internet access reported using it as a means of seeking information but access to and perception of its utility and function varied both within and among the three populations as illustrated in the following responses to how often they go online only when im in school to do projects and stuff because other than that i dont need to go to the internet and whenever i get the chance i have a computer at home with aol so i can get on the internet but sometimes when i try to get to certain sites it blocks it because of the parental control so i go to the library too print sources eg books and magazines were less popular than electronic and interpersonal sources as was mass media eg tv and radio again differences appeared between and among study groups and socioeconomic status seemed to condition perceptions of media utility and credibility the university sample for example placed greater trust in books and print media and distinguished sharply between tv newsentertainment and educational tv by contrast the african american ministry tweens identified tv notably situation comedies as an important source of social cues in addressing an information problem tweens used varied sources and often consulted different types of media to answer the same question for example a tween might consult a peer who recommends a web site which is vetted by a parent and ultimately they together consult a store professional austin university described the process he used in finding an audio recorder which included consulting a parent store professionals and finally ebay i said okay where can i get another one of these radio shack wont have them this is the best that radio shack had i need to find some information on where i can get this next one so i talked to my dad i said hey dad this voice recorder doesnt work and he said shoot lets pack it up and take it back so i packed it up and then i said so where should i get some information for it or where do you think i could find another one that works and he said well what about radio shack do they have any other ones i said well this was the most expensive one there its probably the one that they that will work the best and so i didnt know what to do so i suggested ebay and he said i dont know if theyll have anything good but you can check it though so we checked it and found this really cool little voice recorder thing which i talked about eventually we looked at the price it seemed reasonable so we went ahead and got it and it worked fine when tweens recalled a time when they needed information they mostly used an interpersonal sourceas seen in table  which details each tweens age sex information need and resulting strategy in nineteen of twentyfive incidents recorded in individual interviews using a critical incident approach tweens used another person as the primary or secondary source of information many strategies involved multiple sources including interpersonal media and internet search tools tweens thus employed a kind of information bricolage gathering and assembling readyathand information from varied persons and media in the course of a single problem provided they were motivated to do so tweens also indicated that they frequently satisfice or use good enough information when they are less motivatedthis is a phenomenon coined by herbert simon  and developed by lis researchers such as patrick wilson  due to the differences within and among the tween groups further study is warranted to elaborate on and clarify these preliminary findings table  tween information needs and strategies

seeking information we often encounter barriersproblems of time access quantity or quality among others how we overcome the barriers to our informationseeking is accepted as part of our search strategies and solutions when talking with preteens however we found that barriers often affected what questions they felt they could asksome barriers not only hindered solutions but played more deeply in their developing identity as informationseekers the tweens age and maturity signified some obvious barriers to informationseeking and use less obvious but no less salient barriers however were constructed by the power and authority structure of the tween social context collectively the tweens reported the following barriers  concerns for safety parents often constrain tween movement and media access due to concern for safety and wellbeing eg limits on which neighborhoods they can visit and when restriction of access to chat rooms because of predators tweens often recognize that this is for their own good but they sometimes resent such restrictions  reduced mobility tweens often rely on adults for transportation which limits their physical information venueshow often and when they may use them  adult authority the nature of adult control over information resources including tools conditions informationseeking adults may also enforce certain behaviors organization and sharing practices such as leaving notes or recordings on a family calendar  oversight monitoring the mere presence of adults can influence whether tweens feel comfortable sharing information tweens report a trust gap emerging in their relationship with parents teachers and other adults during this age span  access to information technologies not all tweens have the same level of access to computers the internet and telephones based on household rules socioeconomic status and education background adults are often in charge of making these choices for them  schedule daily structure much of the tween day is spent in school where the above barriers are even more salient the times when tweens are permitted to share information limit how and what can be shared  social costs perceptions tweens associate some types of ib with social costs including embarrassment and loss of esteem this barrier conditions when tweens will ask questions with whom they will share information and what types of information they will share adults are often more reliable sources of information but their associated costs misunderstanding embarrassment punishment often make them prohibitive often the tweens realized that these barriers were part of the parents concern for their safety and welfare examples from the focus groups included my mom says i cant go to the mall until i turn  years old he a friend lives up by a highway so i cant ride my bike up there my mom doesnt really like that chat room thing so she put me on a kid aol i know when we can go over there a neighborhood hangout and when we cant on tuesdays its really really bad over there like theres people that smoke and they drink back there so i dont go there on tuesday nights during the interviews most tweens seventeen of twentyfive agreed that there are many places that is information grounds where they can go to share information with their peers these places included physical settings such as school home friends homes church shopping malls and public parks where they routinely gather with friends to socialize they also include virtual environments tweens also noted that they use asynchronous virtual spaces including chat rooms weblogs and multiuser web sites to display their feelings mr blackwood university write whatever you want or have an interesting conversation austin university communication technologies that preteens reported using with their peers were email instant messaging im and the telephone some tweens however identified significant barriers to informationsharing either for themselves or for other kids they know these barriers fell into three categories the safety of public spaces concerns for tween privacy and the authority of parents and adults omar ministry suggested that some neighborhoods are dangerous for preteens preventing them from gathering conveniently some kids live in neighborhoods where you cant just walk down the street and go talk to other kids your age tweens often do not want to share information in the presence of adults particularly concerning personal issues and this limits the number of places where they can socialize and the type of information that will be shared rose university explained some places have grownups and some preteens dont really like to talk about private stuff once grownups are around megan school reported that parents often intrude on youth conversations which can interrupt informationsharing meant to be between peers when youre talking with your friends about something and then maybe an adult or your parent is walking by the door and they hear and then they come in and start telling you everything about their personal experiences tweens were aware of the limitations adults imposed on their informationsharing both on their mobility and on the types of communication media they could use with peers madison university explained that some tweens have more freedom and mobility than others and that this is a product of parental or family dynamics some parents want tweens to stay in the house and help do chores and that kind of stuff so they dont get to hang out with their friends very much and other preteens their parents dont care where they go so they can go anywhere and just get information from there sydney university did not feel that she had many places where she could talk to friends outside of school or her room i dont have a lot of places except for my room or if i have my friend over or something kylie university expressed the limitations of parental permission to engage in some forms of informationsharing im not allowed to go on im or chat rooms so i basically have the phone and email and facetoface rq  how do tweens manage their accumulated everyday information keeping track of everyday information is an important aspect of use particularly of reuse the research team hoped to explore the management dimension as an important aspect of how tweens use and reuse information and of how their access to digital tools computer software email web browsers etc might affect the ways that they organize their social worlds tweens reported different techniques for managing their everyday information but most relied on keeping temporary notes postits writing on hands  percent and sheer memory  percent while many reported the use of bookmarks and affordances for organizing information within a technology tool only a few used planners organizers or technological tools for personal information management  percent further probes in the interviews however showed that some tweens used unique artifacts and strategies eg homemade calendars and planners or writing on their hands as memory aids shayla school reported using a mnemonic device selfgenerated songs to remember information which the researchers found to be clever and unique among the participants thirteen participants detailed management strategies that included two or more types both lauren university and peyton ministry said that their schools promote information management by providing calendars or planners as a scaffold students are encouraged to write down assignments schedules and other school information but they may also use these tools beyond the classroom for personal information peyton added that he uses his school planner to track friends phone numbers and other social information four participants specifically noted involving their parents in their information management either by using a family calendar austin university keeping notes by the phone kylie university or by telling their parents things they wished to remember themselves shaniqua ministry kylie university madison university this latter group which included some of the studys youngest participants admitted to reducing their own cognitive load by allowing parents to manage some of their information austins family calendar is designed to alert both parents and children of social obligations including play dates and outings as well as to track rental media due dates this illustrates that some preteens are conscious of the need for joint information management with adults who are responsible for or must at least validate certain preteen activities this however is an adult management activity in which preteens are asked to participate not one that preteens necessarily initiate computers were mentioned by only five participants as important information management tools ellen further explained that it is important to have an information management strategy that supports retrieval and that writing notes is not always reliable i have pieces of paper everywhere if i write it down its sure its going to get lost brenda school on the other hand uses a set of six different diaries to keep track of her information she described the system she uses to keep track of different kinds of information i have like six diaries at home because every year somebody gives me two diaries or something for my birthday and so i have one that i have my agenda in and i have one that i have facts inlike math facts and writing facts and stuff like that and then i have one thats kept for boys and girls that if i meet somebody new i write about them and then i have another one thats like like dear diary today i did this and this and this and this and this and then i have another one thats facts that people tell me and i write it downlike say it was at recess id remember it and when i got in the classroom id write it down on a piece of paper and id take that piece of paper home and then that day right awayi would not do my homework cause then id forget about the piece of paperand id write it down in my diary observations of tweens in the computer lab revealed that they often used memorized strategies and common routes to refind webbased information in the absence of bookmarks rq  what criteria do tweens use in assessing and sharing information and sources in an era of information overload researchers suggest that young people may be approaching information assessment and using it differently than previous generations did  but social or interpersonal information particularly about everyday life has different qualities than academic information diving further into tweens experience of informationseeking we hoped to tease out how they approached information assessment as a critical component of their social informationseeking strategy but also how those assessments affected their views of source authority as well as their motivations in sharing information with others visceral affective criteria emerged as important components of how tweens assess interpersonal information they used notions of credibility and trust as well as of the social costs associated with informationsharing as important factors in deciding whom to consult and with whom to share information these exploratory findings suggest that peer influence is ascendant in this process while parent influence over informationsharing is waning the rate of this change and the developmental factors that influence this change in the status of peers and adults requires further exploration with a larger sample and more detailed documentation of behavior over time tweens displayed varying and often naive criteria for assessing the veracity of more formal information sources and content displaying both marked mature and immature notions of cognitive authority they measured information against their personal experience but their responses suggest that they rely heavily on the judgments of peers and adults to select vetted information some tweens reported understanding and using concepts of triangulation to verify information content but this was not widely in evidence and varied among the study samples tweens readily provided evaluations of different information sources as well as their perspectives on the authority of different informants during the interviews tweens were asked to judge the truth of different generalizations or statements about tweens see table  for a summary of responses to these questions this became a rich source of data about how tweens evaluated information justifying their knowledge claims by drawing on prior experience was most common although the statements posed to the tweens were overly simplistic the tweens were not required to prove or disprove them nonetheless a very common response was the counterexample typified by aeisha ministry no its not true because when i asked my teacher how many people died on the lewis and clark expedition she couldnt answer it frank school also noted that referring to another authority is a sign of ones incomplete knowledge actually ive asked my mom a couple things and she had to say ask myask my dad because she didnt know ellen university told us that knowledge and authority are domain specific and she suggested that teachers are not only limited in how they see the world but also prejudiced against other knowledge domainsa bold statement teachers have strengths in certain areas and weaknesses in understanding its like my science teacher and math teacher hate language arts she cant understand writing my language arts teacher hates math i dont understand why anybodyteachers can be very biased on their own subject but not only

knowledge sources must be evaluated ause if its a guy teacher they cant answer like girl problemslike you started your period some tweens found reason to dispute the authority of teachers largely through anecdotal evidence but extrapolated these anomalous occurrences to a broader perception of teachers in general mr henderson university remarked teachers are not really that trustworthy this was supported by brooke university who recalled i realized that my teacher doesnt always answer the questions right and sometimes he doesnt always have the answers these latter examples show that initial evaluation of knowledge sources is the answer my teacher gave me correct translates into more broad justifications for knowing are teachers credible through the interviews tweens revealed that they engage in several regulating behaviors in the informationseeking process many behaviors revolved around the social cost of informationsharing the act of asking questions can be a socially awkward act and tweens were especially attuned to the issue of embarrassment in revealing their knowledge gaps they also actively assess the quality of their questions for the circumstance brooke university revealed some conditions under which tweens will not ask a question they might be too embarrassed to ask too proud to ask or they just dont think its important enough to ask tweens also told us that they feel more in control of their curiosity as a result of maturation adam school stated thats true because i dont like to ask as many questionslike little kids do cause when youre little youre really really curious so you blurt out whatever youre thinking  now that youre a preteen you think about what youre gonna say before you say it tweens explained that they need to regulate the information that they take in from others and that sometimes information directed toward them is unwelcome brooke university stated that illtimed information can be an impediment to certain processes we dont like information when we dont need it because it seems to clutter up the way get in the way of what were doing austin university provided a sophisticated view of knowledge provided by teachers specifically feedback on assignments he explained that some knowledge is appreciated temporally and that his opinion of the advice may change over time longterm vs shortterm meaning of the same information given i usually like it when im given information unless its criticism and then ill like it in the long run but not in the short run not while its happening will i like it if you write a paper for english if its harsh criticism i dont like it if they say you misspelled this then thats all right but if they say man this paper sucks what were you thinking id say whats wrong about it and theyd say well its a terrible subject you obviously dont know what youre writing about and i think youd be better selling your computer and getting a turtle farm thats the kind of information that doesnt click with me the tweens also suggested that they were not only aware of their own knowledge regulation behaviors but were keenly aware of others regulating knowing as well the following dialogue with amber school illustrates how knowledge is sometimes held back from tweens and that they are cognizant that adults are motivated to do so interviewer can parents answer any question that a preteen might have amber probably not because they might not understand it or they might not know the answer and they might not want to tell you so its one of those things like they know but you dont know that they know so they might say i have no idea course they know but they dont wanna tell you the interviews revealed that tweens are aware of their knowledge dispositions and motivations as well as the motivations that may lie behind different types of informationseeking and sharing while the focus of this study was everyday information references to school work invariably surfaced trevor school explained that looking up information in books is only valuable when there is a specific kind of need either one prompted by a school assignment or by intense personal curiosity otherwise as in the example he provided what year was henry ford born in a simple answer a long time ago is sufficient this is often referred to as satisficing when a precise answer is not necessary due to constraints of time motivation or access to knowledge rq  what roles are played by different social types regarding information flow social types have been shown to play an important role in the flow of information   social types were hypothesized to be an important factor for preteens in how they sought and used information particularly in light of their developing social worlds little is known however about how tweens frame social types what roles they assign and how and what impact this has on their informationseeking behavior in the focus groups tweens were asked to discuss how they shared information with other persons including friends family teachers and strangers using mark granoveters  concept of strong and weak ties the tweens were asked to differentiate between strong and weak relationships and how this influenced their choices to share information and the information they might spontaneously share tweens displayed a vetting process that relied heavily on affective concerns trust and specifically the duration of relationships longer relationships were deemed to be qualitatively better and more stable for interpersonal informationsharing tweens distinguished levels of social interaction within their own peer group as well as with the adult peer group personal information and needs were shared only with strong ties and this was particularly true of information that had potentially high social costs associated eg crushes or relationships information shared with weak tiesstrangers or mere acquaintancesmight be logistical directions time and wayfinding or of little social consequence the strongest evidence for social types and how this influences information flow came from the individual interviews tweens had widely variant notions of the adult social type as a source of information parents and teachers were seen as distinct types rather than as roles that adults play within a social type thus varying levels of knowledge were associated with teachers and parents enabling them to answer different types of questions tweens framed this in terms of types of questions that could be asked of different persons there emerged a kid question type for example that was unsuitable for asking adults often based on the perceived consequences or costs associated with seeking different kinds of information these different social types and resulting questions types were linked to trust affect and social barriers that were a product of institutional and family structures that both afforded and constrained information flow sydney university suggested that posing questions to friends was a way of demonstrating some autonomy from adults sometimes i can ask my friends and theyll tell me and so i dont always need an adults help aeisha ministry added a different spin saying that sometimes its a question thats meant for a kid to answer that an adult might not understand the idea that there are kid questions asked of peers and adult questions reserved for adults was a prevalent theme peyton university who earlier perceived that adults are not capable of understanding some preteen issues suggested in the following exchange that adults make communication difficult between adults and preteens peyton they might not understand what youre going through so theyll just automatically give an adult answer instead of a kid answer so we could understand instead of us getting in trouble or something interviewer so adults make it hard for kids to talk to other kids peyton no not other kids they make it hard for us preteens to talk to them adults according to peyton tweens seek information from their peers on social issues because they have difficulty communicating with adults who might otherwise be a preferred source he distinguishes between two types of answers kid answers which can be understood by young people and adult answers which are perceived by tweens as inappropriate and punitive mr henderson university said it would be uncomfortable to ask certain questions of adults rose university explained that parents will inadvertently embarrass tweens in public if they are aware of information that is really personal such as the boy you like within a peer group our participants said that there are close friends or good friends whom one can trust with more sensitive information other members of the peer group may be called friends but they are less trustworthypeople whom peyton described friends that i just say hi and bye to in short within the broader friends social type the tweens identified friends by tie strength and shared different information on this basis rq  what are the roles of information grounds in tweens lives an information ground is a synergistic environment temporarily created when people come together for a singular purpose but from whose behavior emerges a social atmosphere that fosters the spontaneous and serendipitous sharing of information  p  as discussed by karen fisher carol landry and charles naumer  such informationrich social settings can be analyzed or facilitated using fifteen characteristics presented in a peopleplaceinformation trichotomy in light of research reported by fisher and naumer  along with our earlier environmental scanning we expected that tweens might have unique information grounds based on their social and developmental uniqueness the tweens reported a variety of places that they share information usually with their peers the most common information grounds were school including cafeteria hallway playground and bus shopping malls athletic fields community parks home and their neighborhoods less common information grounds ranged from churches and libraries to restaurants convenience stores and public transit school was the most common information ground for good reason all the tweens attended school it is a common place to plan social activities it is a place where opportunities to mingle and socialize are planned into the schedule albeit with constraints tweens also used school as a place to plan other opportunities to get together in person or online in focus groups tweens explained like half of our school is in the lunchroom so you can talk to more people me and my friends at recess we talk to each other and at school we ask each other if well be on im within schools recess and lunch were noted as times of the school day when preteens were most likely to share information lauren university explained you can always do it at school you can always do it at recess you can always do it at lunch you can do it after school you can do it before school if you got there early enough and if they come over to your house they can always do it there some tweens reported that the school can also be a place for social interactions among ethnic groups this was reported most frequently in our ministry group who were all african american tween theres the group things theres the table where all the mexicans sit and they talk spanish most the time and theres other tables and stuff and like yeah so we just talk about stuff so we just talk about stuff interviewer what kind of stuff tween movies our homework not everyone viewed school as a place where information flows easily ellen university pragmatically saw school which many tweens acknowledged as a place where socialization occurs as a highly structured environment where adults discourage social opportunities we have almost no time for socializing except for lunch we get fiveminute breaks between hours you get five minutes to walk from one end of the school take a detour to the locker pick up our five pounds of stuff walk around to the other side of the school sit down unpack all by the end of the bell and go back to the bathroom and get kleenex it feels like a lot of work and i dont see how they expect us to socialize in that time as well in addition to school tweens reported other locations that may be considered information grounds the neighborhood was commonly cited as a place where tweens get together after school and on weekends due to the concentration of kids that permits easy socialization sometimes i go over and since theres a million kids in that culdesac if one cant play with me then i go over to somebody elses house the shopping mall was also cited as a place where tweens could find peers with whom to socialize shop and share information our informants explained you meet up with your friends and you go to the mall and then when you get to the mall you usually go in shops and you go like oh this is a nice coat you know stuff like that and i hang out with my sister shes fifteen and we go to the mall and watch movies and stuff athletic fields and sporting events both organized and casual provided opportunities for tweens to get together tweens also identified these as places where their parents could socialize if they were involved directly in a soccer match or other athletic contest when asked the reasons for choosing these information grounds tweens reported the following important considerations  peer interaction i like the fact when you meet people around your age group pretty much all the people are really nice  access to older teens sometimes we can ask questions  opportunities to play i like video games  computer access they have computers at the library there were salient differences among the three study samples with regard to information grounds the suburban school tweens felt comfortable in their neighborhoods particularly the culdesac which afforded both play and socialization for the urban ministry group the neighborhood provided some places to socialize eg ball courts but mobility was constrained by concerns for safety the urbansuburban university tweens often did not socialize in the neighborhood except to the extent that neighbors were also schoolmates the limited mobility of tweens was made up for in two of our groups university and school by access to virtual interactions eg email web chat in the ministry group only one tween had home internet access chatman and the principles revisited according to chatmans normative behavior framework the thirtyfour tweens in our study should have lived in similar small worlds sharing a cultural space where few surprises occur life is predictable and informationseeking is viewed as a normal and healthy albeit somewhat boring behavior that is necessary for holding the collective worldview or reality together our research revealed differences in what perhaps could be best described as multiple normative behavior disorder to pun on chatman the tweens repeatedly discussed straddling multiple worlds navigating many systems simultaneouslythe home the school the neighborhood clubs the world at large and so fortheach with its own set of social norms worldview social types and expectedcondoned information behavior that could be in balance or diametric to those of the others moreover data analysis revealed that successful coping or healthful informationseeking behavior by the tweens suggested an ability to engage in multiple discourses or multiliteracies as a result of their expanding social networkssocial worlds paired with increased cognitive maturation developmental factors social affective and cognitive maturity have an important influence on tween information behaviors and their place in the multiple information worlds they inhabit other factors particularly race and socioeconomic status emerged strongly within our study samplesno doubt these also play an important role and require investigation while this study sought to delineate how tweens may be unique among other age groups tweens are by no means homogenous we approached tween informationseeking as a healthy part of their development but we found that in some tweens worlds informationseeking is rebellious dangerous or socially stigmatizing further we found that parents and tweens values regarding informationseeking often come in conflict creating unhealthy situations for some tweens additional research is needed to tease out these other factors and to identify how cultural economic and educationrelated aspects of preteens lives affect their information behavior the principles of harris and dewdeny  and the lessons of case  applied to the supporting evidence from our tween informants suggest that the collective lessons of research on adult information behavior are for the most part broadly applicable to youth there were however some important emphases in tweens accounts of their informationseeking that influence the way these broad general considerations may be applied we find the following summary points specific to our study group useful in assessing the fit between prior work and our own analysis  tweens developing social worlds create a dynamic situation for informationseeking and use the tweens are negotiating new relationships with interpersonal information sources  emotional support must preempt the asking of questions rather than merely accompanying it children need a supportive environment for inquiry barriers to informationseeking are strongly linked with emotions and social costs  tweens reported rejecting formal information channels and institutions in favor of interpersonal sources for everydaylife information information behavior often transcends the boundaries of traditional help systems  tween information behaviors can be complex beyond notions of least effort tweens expressed that they calculated social costs and benefits of sharing information and information needs social roles were important factors in assessing trust  tweens rely on informal social spaces ie information grounds both virtual and facetoface for everyday life information within formal spaces like school tweens adapt and adopt social spaces hallways bathrooms cafeterias for informationsharing table  aligns these points with the frameworks of harris and dewdeny and case the points above can be further distilled into a guiding framework for the development of youthcentered information services for tweens table  principles of information behavior and tweens everyday life behaviors principle  information seeking is a natural and necessary part of tweens physical social and intellectual growth related literature supporting evidence from tweens key points  information needs arise from the helpseekers situation harris and dewdney principle no  informationseeking is a dynamic process case lesson no  it really is kind of a time when were trying to find out about as much as we can or at least for me thats how it issometimes i can ask my friends and theyll tell me and so i dont always need an adults helpsome places have grownups and some preteens dont really like to talk about private stuff once grownups are aroundlike a relationship between a girlfriend and a boyfriend or something you might not go to your parents for advice or something because they might blow something out of proportion something like that but if you talk to your friends they probably wont know what to say but it will be easier to talk to them tweens developing social worlds create a dynamic situation for information seeking and use they are negotiating new relationships with interpersonal information sources principle  all aspects of information behavior have social and affective nuances  information seekers expect emotional support harris and dewdney principle no  they might be too embarrassed to ask too proud to ask or they just dont think its important enough to askbecause sometimes we dont ask people questions because we dont want them to know that we dont know do you know what i mean by that youd be embarrassed because you dont want them to know that you dont knowadults really embarrass preteens but sometimes its okay for a parent to be there because they might if its a bad situation they might help out if theres a problemif someone knows more than i do i can ask if i need anything and it makes me feel good that there is someone i can ask emotional support must preempt the asking of questions children need a supportive environment for inquiry barriers to information seeking are strongly linked with emotions and social costs principle  information literacy is developed and honed in informal settings as well as in tandem with formal scholastic venues  the decision to seek help or not seek help is affected by many factors harris and dewdney principle no  sometimes informationparticularly generalized packages of informationdoesnt help case lesson no  sometimes it is not possible to make information available or accessible case lesson no  teachers are better for learning math reading but friends are better for talking about movies and games and stuff like thattheres also some things you cant really find at a library because the information is so hard to find so sometimes its easier to find it on the internetwhenever i feel like i dont know something ill just call somebody who i think might know or ask someone like my parentsyeah like nineteenyearolds that just come and like ride their bikes and like hang out and then its like sometimes we can ask them questions tweens reported rejecting formal information channels and institutions in favor of interpersonal sources for everydaylife information information behavior often transcends the boundaries of traditional help systems principle  trust as a blend of cognitive authority and multivariate cost is a critical determinate of information seeking  people tend to first seek help or information from interpersonal sources especially from people like themselves harris and dewdney principle no  formal sources and rationalized searches reflect only once side of information behavior case lesson no  more information is not always better case lesson no  like they parents might not understand what youre going through so theyll just automatically give an adult answer instead of a kid answer so we could understandif you see somebody who you think would be nice you cant like start telling them all your secretsthings that kids do and kids talk about are a lot of the time things that teachers dont talk about and know a lot aboutyeah i can trust my parents more than i can trust my friends but its just easier to talk to my friendsthe only people i will tell are my really good friends and im absolutely sure i can trust them tween information behaviors can be complex beyond notions of least effort tweens expressed that they calculated social costs and benefits of sharing information and information needs social roles were important factors in assessing trust principle  informal social settings provide key opportunities for information exchange particularly about everydaylife situations  people tend to seek information that is most accessible harris and dewdney principle no  people follow habitual patterns in seeking information harris and dewdney principle no  context is central to the transfer of information case lesson no  you can always share information at school you can always do it at recess you can always do it at lunch you can do it after school you can do it before school if you got there early enough and if they come over to your house they can always do it therewhat i like about church group is you get a chance to be with girls around your age and that you get to have somebody to talk to and you can share your opinions and stuff like thatso thats what really catches my attention on myspace cause they teach you a lot tweens rely on informal social spaces ie information grounds both virtual and facetoface for everyday life information within formal spaces like school tweens adapt and adopt social spaces hallways bathrooms cafeterias for information sharing applicability of the research to practice a guiding framework based on our empirical findings regarding tweens everydaylife information behavior we propose that the following five principles be used as a framework for basing the mediation of information services to this age group the principles operate on the basic assumption that tweens are social beings and that informationas part of communicationis natural and empowering informationseeking is a natural and necessary part of tweens physical social and intellectual growthgeneration why as austin and other tweens explained is naturally and insatiably curious they are constantly seeking information to perform academic work as well as aid in their transition to young adulthood two processes are at work during this period of development socialization how they come to adopt social norms and processes of relating to others and individuation how they develop a unique identity among peers both formal and informal sources of everyday life information are critical to these cooccurring developmental processes thus the founding principle of any service agenda to youth should focus on how information is an intrinsic and central aspect in their worlds all aspects of information behavior have social and affective nuancesin most informationseeking incidents described by tweens other people peers parents other adults played paramount roles in the search process this finding is supported by research with younger  and older   populations in the tween years however we begin to see the mediating preferences switch from adults to peers adult influence in informationseeking decreases and comes to be in some instances resented peer friendships begin to perform a more complex purpose not only do these peers provide entertainment and socialization but they also become confidants intimates and sources of assistance in the transition to young adulthood such transitions involve emotions which are important to personal and social life  abraham maslow  stated that social needs such as friendship are integral to the intellectual health of the human tweens develop their emotive worlds through these social connections which were found to be closely intertwined with their everydaylife information needs as their curiosity tends toward relationships and intimacy their informationseeking becomes more affectladen information literacy is developed and honed in informal social settings as well as in tandem with formal scholastic venuesinformation literacy frameworks used in formal education such as the big  and isp  are rarely translated into the world of everydaylife informationseeking tweens reported that they explore different information sourcesinterpersonal text and mediaand often develop an understanding of concepts such as trust and authority through trial and error experimentation these unstructured forays into the realm of informal information literacy are valuable and often prove effective initiatives such as connecting learners to libraries  suggest the need to approach the student audience with unanimity of purpose blending public library and school library agendas tweens benefit from a consistent message and a consistent approach to information literacy however they also need opportunities to explore a variety of information strategies with the support of mediating professionals adults and peers trust as a blend of cognitive authority and multivariate cost is a critical determinate of informationseekingin experimenting with different interpersonal sources tweens are learning valuable lessons about trust and authority factors emerging in their explicit and implicit decisions include  the perceived credibility of the source  the loyalty of the source and  their personal connection to the source ie tie strength tweens may sacrifice information quality in objective terms particularly on sensitive topics like sex to satisfy their need to reduce social costs such as embarrassment intimidation or loss of social status social roles and social types are also important factors in tweens developing conceptions of trust tweens begin to make generalizations sometimes false or naive about the ability of adults and peers to answer their questions as tweens further develop their ability to engage in perspectivetaking they begin to understand more fully their roles as informationseekers as well as the roles others take in helping or hindering their search for information informal social settings provide key opportunities for information exchange particularly about everydaylife situationsjust as formal models of information literacy appear strained in their application to everydaylife problems formal spaces often fail to provide the proper context for informationsharing this study found that tweens have a rich repertoire of strategies for sharing everydaylife information few of which involved formal channels such as libraries and help systems as socialization and information behavior are found to be closely entwined it is important to recognize the power of informal space in mediating the information needs of young people the soccer field the school cafeteria and the shopping mall become essential information grounds to tweens both for satisfying their curiosity and for meeting their developmental needs information professionals who wish to assist tweens in seeking authoritative information must consider expanding their services to these information grounds where possible practitioners who use this framework to guide the development of information services for preteens should audit their current practices and policies looking specifically to increase peer interaction and to foster natural crossover or convergences between everyday and scholastic activities for example are student assistants relegated to shelving books or do they help mediate services through peer assistance do tween users have social spaces physical and virtual to gather and share everydaylife information as well as schoolrelated information how are routine spaces such as hallways lunchrooms bathrooms buses and even libraries school and public being used to promote everyday informationsharing eg information grounds per fisher landry and naumer  are books on sensitive topics eg reproductive health and light topics eg hobbies fashion and music available in modes and venues that can be accessed privately as well as those that appeal to tweens social interests and behaviors as part of information literacy training are tweens instructed in a how to recognize or clarify information needs in their own minds as well as the information needs of others b articulate those needs to others personally or using an information system and c use efficient strategies for sharing and managing information such questions focus attention on the developmental needs of youth and how services can be oriented toward their personal and social growth as informationseekers conclusion this exploratory study of three groups of tweens yielded rich insights into their everyday information worlds many threads were illuminated for further research with tweens in different settings and for exploration with other age groups as well moreover the themes that ran across the data showed varying degrees of fit with chatmans general concept of small worlds and her theories of everydaylife informationseeking chatman a luminary in the lis field should be properly credited with coining the concept of information worlds for indeed that is the precise phenomenon to which her work leads what may begin as a small world especially for those starting from sociology morphs quickly into an information world as we land squarely in the middle of all the emotional social political physical technical and yes informational complexity when we consider phenomena through the lens of chatman a complementary framework to chatmans on several levels and one of the first in lis to focus explicitly on the physical role of context fishers information grounds proved useful for understanding the role of social settings in information flow particularly how the presence of key individuals affect tweens views of whether a locale is good for information our data revealed varying degrees of fit with the principles summarized by harris and dewdney and case suggesting unique attributes to tweens and perhaps all minors seeing as the principles were largely drawn from research of adults an important issue arising libraries and information professionals labor to build collections both physical and virtual under the assumption that access to print and media is of central importance to resolving users information needs in discussing everydaylife information problems with tweens however we found that it is access to other people that often makes or breaks an information search this has important implications for those who provide information services to young people our fivepoint framework emphasizes the critical role that social factors play in mediating successful informationseeking as well as developing efficacious information behaviors in preteens vygotskys concept of a zone of proximal development suggests that adults play important roles in developing informationseeking skills through modeling and scaffolding behavior our research extends this concept to include peer mediation of information skills particularly in the realm of everydaylife information problems furthermore the richness and complexity of informal social settings has been shown to provide an important context for the development of socially mediated informationseeking practices the more knowledgeable other whether in the form of an adult mediator librarian teacher or parent or a peer must understand and reconcile the informationseekers conception of the information problem as well as the social cognitive and affective resources that the young person brings to bear on it the discourse surrounding information practices becomes paramount being able to distinguish between kid answers and adult answers for example means the difference between successfully solving an information problem and erecting barriers to necessary information a further contribution of this work has been the identification of social costs and their compromising effect on tween informationseeking while other studies have focused on physical or cognitive barriers to youth ib eg  our findings suggest that tweens are capable of articulating their information needs and employing sophisticated strategies yet they may be tripped up by embarrassment social perceptions or unequal power relationships as additional barriers related to affect may exist further research is needed to clarify how and when these barriers emerge developmentally as well as the role these barriers play in different types of informationseeking such research would help mediating professions and institutions better understand how to serve this millennial generation and generations to come
