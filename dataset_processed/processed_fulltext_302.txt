journal of education for librarianship within the ministry of education to address and coordinate among other things standards education and personnel needs in libraries there is also a race to meet the  deadline for having in place a preliminary automated library and information services network and the ministry of education has established nine center for the book and other media locations in universities across china to further aid in the modernization efforts since  a number of training institutes have been established across china both in units within universities departments information centers and in public or academic libraries to accommodate the basic needs for personnel development before that time only two formal programs in library science existed for any length of time in the prc the first of those was originally established as the boone library school boone college wuhan in  ten years later the school became an independent entity and existed as such until after liberation  in  it became the department of library science at the national wuhan university and just recently  received school status within the university as the school of library and information science it now offers two programs at two different levels in both library science and information science beida university beijing which was established in the early  is the other major program both of these schools now offer two programs  an undergraduate degree program four years in duration students in these programs would take their first two years of courses in disciplines such as history or language and literature for library science majors or physics mathematics or computer science for information science majors in addition all of the approximate  stu dents in those programs in the two schools would take at least one foreign language and a political theory course and  a postgraduate master degree program which is three years long and requires a thesis in the third year the small number of about  students in postgraduate programs are now mostly in their thirties and completed their undergraduate programs before the cultural revolution they will be assigned by the government either to teaching positions to scientific research arms of governmental agencies or to university or public libraries current efforts are toward improving the information science component in both levels simmons college graduate school of library and information science has had a long and rewarding relationship with china and particularly with the program at wuhan the program there was started by an american mary elizabeth wood who received her library education at simmons the relationship with that program and others in the prc has continued and accelerated during the last few years when there has been an average of one lecturingconsulting visit per year by members of the simmons faculty in addition there are currently five library educatorresearchers who are studyingresearching at simmons from beida university from wuhan university and from the information science and technology institute of china istic given the one billion person population of china the needs for libraries and information services are obvious yet there are fewer than  librarians and only about five percent of them would actually qualify for that title this figure does not include those individuals working in other information management categories in organi
zations such as i stic or the academy of science this shortage has forced a variety of universities to offer extension courses or short courses to enhance the preparation of individuals for work as a professional in all types of libraries these programs whether part time or short courses offer certificates of completion part time course students either study at their own library or information center or attend nearby institutions which offer the lecture portions of the program for short courses  primarily intended to prepare individuals for work as librarians in small public libraries in factories or other such institutions or for work on collective farms in the countryside  the individual leaves the work place and attends the course for a limited period of time there is a great deal of activity at the undergraduate graduate and continuing education levels for personnel working in all types of libraries and information centers the problems of qualified staff in libraries and qualified faculty to extend educational programs are the primary challenges being faced today the two schools and the ministry of education are being looked to for the leadership role in expanding the horizons my comments are based on observations discussions and readings i did during my seven week stay in china where i lectured and consulted on collection development and management techniques at four universities in four different parts of china at the invitation of the ministry of education issued through wuhan university in the central part of china the other three locations were sichuan university chengdu in the southwestern province of sichuan shanxi teachers university xian in the shanxi province of northwestern china and beida university beijing in northinternational library education eastern china my consulting at sichuan and shanxi was done for the united board of christian higher education in asia one hears and reads about the crowds on the one hand and the tranquil beauty on the other but can never be quite prepared for the lasting impressions of both for instance when i walked into my first lecture three hours in length i was unprepared to see over one thousand eager librarians some of whom had traveled over  miles to hear me always the sea of tape recorder antennas in the first few rows is a small but poignant indication of the eagerness to learn to advance to modernize the oldest library system in the world every place i went each group i talked with and almost to the person chinese librarians are eager to develop themselves as professionals and the services they offer their public they are interested in our library and information science education programs particularly the integrated approach we have taken their separated preparation for librarians and information scientists is a holdover from the period of influence of russians as foreign experts librarians are interested in new technology open stack systems cataloging and classification practices management methods and collection development they are anxious to teach new methods and are embarked on translation projects for several library science textbooks they are anxious to establish exchange agreements and would gladly accept duplicate materials in library and information science for their professional collections all of this is a very positive sign for the renewal and strengthening of our professional relationship in order to promote the development of library and information services
