introduction at a  conference of california academic and research libraries john d berry was a panelist at a session entitled reference service to ethnic minorities an intercultural exchange near the end of the session berry native american studies librarian at the university of california berkeley relates one academic librarian in the audience said and i paraphrase so if we just treat everybody nicely that should do it berry comments that this librarian did not mean this poorly but they still apparently didnt get it and asks what exactly is necessary to get across the ideals and values of diversity not just in improved reference services but profession wide  pointing to the concept of white privilege as a useful way of raising white librarians consciousness berry paraphrases questions that peggy mcintosh originally raised in an influential series of papers dating from  i have come to see white privilege as an invisible package of unearned assets that i can count on cashing in every day but about which i was meant to remain oblivious wrote mcintosh white privilege is like an invisible weightless knapsack of special provisions assurances tools maps codebooks passports visas clothes compass emergency gear and blank checks  p  librarians should ask themselves whether a list of berry statements is true including the following i can if i wish arrange to be in the professional company of people of my race most of the time and if i should need to change jobs i can be pretty sure of working in my library position in a library professionally staffed primarily if not exclusively with people of my race a yes answer to most of these questions indicates possession of white privilege says berry that librarians are mostly white and take this whiteness for granted is hardly news in  library and information science lis educator claudia j gollop argued that current and future demographic shifts prompt an urgent need to increase the number of nonwhite lis faculty and students including doctoral students and noted that the american library association ala spectrum initiative was helping to ease the financial burden on students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups  pp  with the mission of improving service at the local level through the development of a representative workforce that reflects the communities served by all libraries in the new millennium ala set up the spectrum initiative in  to address the specific issue of underrepresentation of critically needed ethnic librarians within the profession while serving as a model for ways to bring attention to larger diversity issues in the future  such an ala initiative sends a message to librarians that increasing racial and ethnic diversity in the profession and the closely related effort of fostering multiculturalism through developing ethnic collections services and programs are a good thingindeed something to be celebrated that multiculturalism has also become a valued component of lis research teaching and learning can be seen from the key document that the ala committee on accreditation provides to guide schools seeking ala accreditationstill the hallmark of quality in north american lis education the  standards for accreditation of masters programs in library and information studies requires that program objectives should reflect the role of library and information services in a rapidly changing multicultural multiethnic multilingual society including the role of serving the needs of underserved groups  the term multicultural is hard to define but during the s and s a broad usage developed for the study of diversity by such varied groups as afroamericans chicanos and chicanas asianamericans hispanics native americans and gays and lesbians and for the expression of concern about the representation to the majority society of the cultural identities of race gender ethnicity and sex both currently and historically  p  although multiculturalism covers a variety of social dimensions it is often used as a way of referring in particular to race and ethnicitya pluralistic term that stresses the value of a great variety of different culturesrather than to the oftenpolarizing term race with its dualistic overtones of black and white although race is only one of several dimensions that compose the more inclusive concept of multiculturalism it is also one of the most centraland the most contentious lis practitioners and educators tend to avoid the r word and in lis generally race remains not only understudied but also poorly understood few lis classes include race in their titles and while some researchersespecially library historianshave indeed put race and ethnicity at the center of their research agendas they are relatively small in number a search for race in the titles indexed in the online database library literature and information science confirms the suspicion that the lis community avoids overt discussion of race while embracing talk of multiculturalism and diversity race produced only sixtysix entries at least some of which were certainly false drops while racism produced thirtyseven multicultural or multiculturalism however produced  and diverse or diversity produced  yet race and multiculturalism are far from equivalent and the component parts of multiculturalism have different histories and different theoretical explanations although important parallels can be found among them and overlap exists between for example race and gender moreover the concept of multiculturalism is itself controversial in a  article lis educator lorna peterson  chair of alas committee on education pointed to ways in which multiculturalism and diversity can trivialize issues of equality acknowledging the increased popularity of these terms she also warned that although they may have a comforting feel to librarians unthinkingly applying them to any kind of difference and treating all differences as somehow equal overshadows issues of equity and justice in the diversity vernacular peterson wrote the multicultural are women gays the disabled asian americans hispanics native americans and african americans and in one library workshop i attended knitters were included as the different and therefore multicultural  p  emphasizing the structural and institutional rather than the individual nature of racism peterson pointed to the history of race in the united states as a social construct difference has traditionally meant racial difference in america she argued it is a deep wound in the american consciousness it has meant belief in white superiority and black inferiority and has brought about the marginalization of african americans along with the belief that it is deserved  p  from a very different standpoint blaise cronin longserving dean of the school of library and information science at indiana university bloomington has asked can you celebrate diversity celebrate diversity he wrote in  is a vacuous exhortation yet it has become the rallying cry of a depressing number of muddled though presumably wellmeaning participants at library and other conferences across the nation  p  voicing concerns that both liberals and conservatives have raised cronin complained were all so busy slicing and dicing ourselves into eversmaller groups that the ties that bind are being frayed  in libraryland multicultural and other special interest groups are proliferating at a disconcerting rate fragmenting the whole and creating increasingly balkanized discourse communities  p  cronin here expressed a familiar valuea myth that is enshrined in the national pantheon we the people of the united states may be e pluribus but we are nevertheless unumwe are despite our differences in descent and life experiences one nation to even call attention to these differences cronin hinted is to threaten this unity to endanger us to build unwittingly a tower of babel in the name of diversity that will serve us ill in the long run hardly grounds for celebration  p  what are lis students and faculty to make of this discord how are they to both heed the call for diversity and multiculturalism that ala mandates in lis education and make sense of the criticisms of influential colleagues such as peterson and cronin in this article i contend that substituting multiculturalism and diversity for race allows the library community to evade confronting racism asstilla defining dimension of american society and in this way helps perpetuate it without a clear and intellectually rigorous understanding of race as perhaps the major component of multiculturalism we will fail in our teaching and research to go beyond what peterson has decried as a feelgood definition of difference and will continue to trivialize a feature of american society that is deeply destructive  p  to achieve clarity lis educators need to recognize the roots of our racialized thinking and the ways in which these are still discernable in the lis curriculum i start by outlining four paradigms or models that dominate research and teaching in lissciencetechnology businessmanagement missionservice and societycultureand show how each model incorporates past experience in ways that have left a racialized legacy to the present day invisibly influencing the lis educational communitys concepts of race drawing on recent research into whiteness and an influential theory of racial formation i go on to suggest that although each model transmits an inheritance that perpetuates white privilege and presents barriers to racial diversification in lis each also carries the potential for positive transformation i conclude that faculty members teaching in all four areas are responsible for foregrounding the issue of race in their courses we can start by conceiving of libraries as raceneutral or nonwhite spaces places where whiteness is no longer central and people of color are no longer marginalized i argue that only by carrying on a continuous discussion about race can we achieve this transformation in lis imagination and that some elements of this conversation should include ways in which we can  dismantle the umbrella term multiculturalism and treat as separate entities its constituent components especially race  make alliances with and even recruit faculty with a scholarly interest in race  set aside the facultyasexpert model of curriculum development and practice in favor of the principles and methods of critical pedagogy  seek inspiration and ideas from other types of organization and  above all prioritize race as a matter of urgency just as lis prioritized technology in the last two decades of the twentieth century   see the discussion of multiculturalism and antiracism in    in wayne a wiegands terminology race is an lis blind spot see  p    it is not unknown however for example in  at the university of wisconsinmadisons school of library and information studies students read peggy mcintoshs article  in a required foundation course titled information and its use in cultural context taught by louise s robbins and ethelene whitmire robbins personal communication may   for a thorough overview of scholarship on multiculturalism in library history see  see also the bibliographic essay in  however as patterson toby graham points out librarianship lacks an interpretive scholarly literature on segregation and integration of public libraries it is simply a topic library historians do not know much about  p    using the databases thesaurus produced similar results although the subject term multiculturalism use for cultural pluralism cultural diversity ethnic diversity produced  hits a search for race in the databases controlled vocabulary brought up only thirtythree hits thirtyone of them resulting from the specific subject term race discrimination in employment racism as a subjectheading component brought up  records of which ninetyseven were accounted for by the heading childrens literatureevaluationracism reflecting the historical phenomenon that a majorperhaps the majorarea in which librarians have confronted racism is in depictions of racial minorities in childrens books four curricular models the two major activities that together constitute the lis curriculumteachingandlearning and researchtypically draw on methods and ideas that the field has inherited sometimes from the quite distant past these methods and ideas cluster into four curricular paradigms or models sciencetechnology businessmanagement missionservice and societyculture these influence one another and even overlap but at the same time they have distinct and separate characteristics and compete with one another for legitimacy in the field all draw on past experience in ways that have left a legacy to the present day influencing how we conceptualize or imagine current issues and naturalizing ideologies that once were far from taken for granted a student entering a masters program in lis in north america is likely to take courses that draw language and content from each of these models and it is one of the strengths of lis education as it is currently constituted that it provides a variety of lenses through which students may view their chosen profession but how successfully do these curricular experiences introduce students the great majority of them white to new ideassuch as the concept of white privilegeabout race and how well do they prepare students for the challenge of transforming librarianship into a diverse profession during most of the twentieth century the scientific model was the holy grail of first library science and later library and information science with its stress on measurement feedback rationality and systems science successfully presented itself as value free objective cumulative and the generator of progress the major areas of the lis curriculum that draw on the sciencetechnology model include the organization of information information systems database design research methods and information storage and retrieval courses in these topics are often required curricular components indicating their centrality in lis teaching and learning a glance at the proposed classification scheme for lis research areas also indicates a large number of areas that model themselves on the sciences including all the subspecialties of two major clusters organization of information and information systems and retrieval  but elements of the scientific approach are discernable in many other courses and research areas too especially as the quantitative methods of the social sciences continue to be the gold standard for lis research in recent years the sciencetechnology model has had to battle for ascendancy with a relative newcomer to lis the businessmanagement model drawing on capitalist principles associated with classical liberalism this model depicts the information world including library services as one of supply and demand and of production and consumption by aggregates of individuals information is a commodity information users are consumers or customers and librarians are in the business of giving people what they want curricular elements that draw upon the businessmanagement model include of course classes in management marketing strategic planning program evaluation and typeoflibrary public libraries special libraries etc courses as well as courses that take a businessoriented approach to information production and organization such as knowledge management  pp  research areas that draw from the business model are clustered in the lis classification scheme under the headings managementadministration and types of libraries and information providers in contrast to the businessmanagement model that depicts library and information users as consumers or customers the missionservice model casts them as clients or patrons while librarians are service providers whose job it is to assess and help meet patron needs in fulfilling their service role librarians draw inspiration from their mission and faith in libraries educative role as a public good introducing the first issue of the american library journal in  melvil dewey used the language of christianity as a rhetorical device that his readers must have found very familiar the journals founders he wrote have an intense faith in the future of our libraries  will any man deny to the high calling of such a librarianship the title of profession  pp  nearly seventyfive years later authors of the public library inquiry noted that the library faith as expressed in the belief that reading is inherently good that reading to learn is a useful and a moral behavior and that the public library is a means of democratic progress precisely because of its relationship to books and reading was still firmly entrenched in the library community  p  lis curriculum and research areas with a missionservice orientation include many although not all of the topics included under the lis classification scheme heading services to user populations such as reference and information services serving multicultural populations and information needs and behaviorspractices the societyculture model also has a long history in lis education culture as a concept is notoriously hard to pin down during the nineteenth century writers commonly referred to culture in the same breath as civilization while cultural uplift was a goal of civilizing institutions such as schools libraries museums concert halls and art galleries in contrast to this normative usage social anthropologists used culture in a technical and quasiscientific sense as referring to the primary data of their field uses in lis have veered in both of these directions courses in book arts and studies history collection management and the literatures of various fields as well as courses on reading and literacy center on the concepts of culture and society as does research into these topics in contrast to the sciencetechnology and businessmanagement models courses and research in the societyculture model tend to adopt the values methods and practices of the arts and humanities library users are depicted as readers while librarians are expected to be culturally competent through an expert knowledge of books journals and other library materials they may also be expected to be socially aware or sensitive to the expectations and values of cultures that differ from their own rather than seeing information as a commodity for which individual users must pay this model argues that information is a social or public good one that should be provided for free in the interests of society as a whole and just as sciencetechnology and businessmanagement models overlap in their emphasis on systems and rationality the missionservice and societyculture models overlap in their appeal to the common values embedded in words such as civilization and citizenship although they have their origins in the relatively distant past the societyculture and missionservices models are also home to research and teaching in newer areas including multiculturalism for instance the research heading services to user populations includes a topic called serving multicultural populations while courses in literature and services for children and young adults frequently contain units on multicultural materials race evolution of a social construct multiculturalism is a term that has inspired much debate outside librarianship as well as within it a term that has its rootsat least in partin the adoption of ethnicity instead of race as a classifying construct historian matthew frye jacobson explains how a twentiethcentury understanding of racial classification that included the apparently scientific term caucasian developed over time out of a nineteenthcentury debate over whiteness and citizenship the period of massive european immigration from  to  the date of the johnsonreed immigration law that set up a restrictive quota system based on race says jacobson witnessed a fracturing of whiteness into a hierarchy of plural and scientifically determined white races jacobson recounts the story of how celts hebrews slavs and mediterraneans became caucasians and thereby eligible for citizenship while law and practice excluded people of color and these formerly commonsense multiple racial categories became transformed into the national or ethnic categories of irish russian jews poles and greeks  pp  at the same time social darwinist theories of race prevailed that posited racial inferiority as part of a natural order of humankind in which white skin was the norm while other skin colors were exotic mutations which had to be explained note sociologists michael omi and howard winant  p  in the late nineteenth century biological theories of racial difference joined with a powerful eugenics movement that believed that the wealth of the white upper classes resulted from their superior heredity to strongly influence the united states restrictive immigration policy during the s omi and winants theory of racial formation shows how in the early decades of the twentieth century ethnicity replaced the earlier biological theories as sociologists began to develop an alternative socialscientific theory of race based on an analogy between groups based on race and european immigrant groups key components of the ethnicitybased theory were contact conflict accommodation and assimilation which ethnicity theorists saw as forming the four stages of a racerelations cycle subsequently during the new deal and world war ii ethnicity theory with its emphasis on social and cultural processes that included religion language and politics largely succeeded in replacing biologism at least for the time being yet this new paradigm of ethnicity omi and winant point out was solidly based in the framework of european white ethnicity and could not appreciate the extent to which racial inequality differed from ethnic inequality  pp  prior to the civilrights era of the s issues of race were usually cast as a matter of prejudiced attitudes on the part of individuals and of discriminatory policies on the part of organizations and institutions yet if ethnicity theory tried to define civilrights progress in terms that defined racial minority groups as latterday immigrants whose main task was to assimilate into mainstream society such groups themselves did not always see the issue in the same light by the end of the s the founding of more militant radical movements such as black power and the american indian movement drew attention to structural features of racism in the united states many of which came to be included along with racist attitudes and discriminatory policies under the overall term institutional racism in the postcivilrights era despite the legislative gains of the s racism has persisted through continuing residential segregation unequal education and employment practices racial stereotyping and the discriminatory use of state agencies such as the police the courts and the prisons resulting in a skyrocketing rate of arrest and incarceration particularly of african american men  esp pp  at the beginning of the twentyfirst century race remains a contested concept there are those who still see race as a fixed and objective realityperhaps in an updated form as a genetic term despite the scientific evidence to the contrary then there are thoseincluding neoconservativeswho claim that race exists only in the eye of the beholder that it is basically an illusion and that discussion of race should take place if at all at the subjective individual level yet others see race as only one of a number of social dimensions that fit under the umbrella of multiculturalism a pluralistic concept that values cultural diversity and yet it owes much to earlier ethnicity theories that at least implicitly supported assimilation including the very idea of cultural pluralism finally there are those who see race as encompassing continuously socially constructed and politically contested meanings of racial categories racial identity and racialized experience an influential example that falls into this last group winant and omis theory of racial formation encapsulates two related aspects race as the subject of struggle and contest at the level of social structure and race as a contested theme at the level of social signification or the production of meanings  p  their theory encourages the lis community to ask how has the development of american libraries contributed to the production and maintenance of hierarchical social structures based on essentialized racial categories and how does it still do this how did libraries help european immigrants become caucasian while constituting noneuropean people of color as racially other in the precivilrights era jim crow policies that denied african americans the same library services as whites made a negative structural contribution to racial formation in the current lis context policies that encourage recruitment and retention of minority faculty and students make a more positive structural contribution although neoconservatives might disagree but what other structures support the normalization of whiteness in libraries and library educationstructures perhaps so familiar that many of us take them for granted and how does the lis curriculum contribute to the maintenance of racist significationsthose ways in which race is culturally figured and represented the manner in which race comes to be meaningful as a descriptor of group or individual identity social issues and experience  p    one of the most famous if controversial books is  see also  race in the four curricular models paradoxically it is the comparatively hospitable missionservice and societyculture models that in addition to making space for courses with multicultural content have also incorporated racialized thinking into lis in ways that white librarians and educators rarely acknowledge today perhaps because these models first influenced librarianship in a more overtly racist but relatively distant past one of the ways that structures and significations of early racial formation in librarianship had a lasting if hidden influence was through widespread acceptance of the assimilationist service and mission metaphora metaphor based on a practice that as historians have pointed out contributed both at home and abroad to an imperial ideology that defined people of color as inferior  drawing on religious injunctions that christians interpreted as a call to give service to the less fortunate the nineteenthcentury invention of charitable or philanthropic service turned on its head social practices whereby inferior servants gave service to superior masters instead the social and cultural missionaries who ministered to immigrants the working class and racial minorities thereby laid claim to their own cultural and social superiority the language of the cultural mission infused nineteenth and early twentiethcentury librarianship while undoubtedly benign in intention the legacy of this missionary spirit lives on in lis language that tends to cast all library patrons but especially those belonging to minority groups as deficient and in need of remediation by normally white librarians  in a  library journal article for instance journal staff writers described cynthia chadwick of the arapahoe library district centennial colorado as the missionary for her work supervising the homebound service an early childhood literacy program and an unusually imaginative program that helps parents in jail connect to their children by which they record themselves reading books aloud and the library sends the books and tapes to the children  in this example the missionary librarian improves the lives of those in disadvantaged circumstancesshutins usually elderly and disabled people the very young and the incarcerated also influenced by the language of the mission the societyculture model has historically embedded racialized thinking in lis through the acceptance of normalized white anglophone collections and professional practices library collections themselves constitute a kind of legacyone that successive generations of librarians inherit and tend to take for granted during the period of rapid library expansion collection developers accepted as normal an assimilationist role that dominated public library service during the period from the s to the s  those progressive era librarians who embraced with enthusiasm the role of supporting the cultures of foreign immigrants through foreignlanguage collection building and program development were displaying selective cultural pluralisman ideology that was consistent with their role as contributors to the construction of a single white caucasian race cultural pluralists welcomed the retention of superficial cultural differences eg in food or national customs while holding to a theory of social power that depended on individual rather than social structural factors thereby failing to take account of structural causes of the unequal distribution of power and resources  yet librarians were selective in their adoption of this liberal attitude andrew wertheimer notes that in the early twentieth century west coast librarians failed to develop extensive outreach programs for japanese immigrants unlike those that east coast librarians developed for european immigrants and concludes that antiasian racism was firmly entrenched in the s  pp  it is also from within the societyculture model that one of the most successful and sustained attacks on racialized collection management has been mounted that of multicultural childrens literature in  the international reading associations former president nancy larrick drew attention to the allwhite world of childrens books but even before the publication of this landmark article some librarians recognized a need for a multicultural approach to providing childrens services and collections and from the mids and s on a great push for multicultural inclusiveness in childrens literature ensured that attention to diversity now constitutes a standard element in courses on childrens and young adult literature   p   through the creation of controlled vocabularies the metaphor of the mission has also influenced activities that nominally fall within the sciencetechnology model language that permits white library students and practitioners to refer to nonwhite patrons as those people and that contributes to the normalization of whiteness in libraries and librarianship remains a problem  the controlled vocabulary employed in library literature and information science provides an illustration of a builtin assumption that minority groups are inherently needy the subject heading public librariesservices to minorities expands to eight further headings minoritiesreading public librariesservices to asian americans public librariesservices to blacks public librariesservices to italian americans public librariesservices to migrants public librariesservices to north american indians public librariesservices to polish americans and public librariesservices to spanish americans while much thought has no doubt gone into using names for minority groups that pay attention to the current sensibilities of the groups concerned librarians need also to be alert to the linguistic construction services to one that divides library practice into two groups the knowing service providers and unknowing recipients note too the telling absence of specialized services to groups of northerneuropean descent german americans or swedish americans for instance are presumably too well absorbed into the librarians mental model of the normal american to need special designation along with the supposedly more disadvantaged italians blacks asians and so on while the very idea of the british american probably makes little sense in this context in other ways too the sciencetechnology modelostensibly value and prejudice freehas failed to provide an encouraging environment for the fostering of racial diversity on the contrary a large literature attests to the marginalization of women and underrepresented minorities in the normally white male world of science technology and engineering both institutionally and structurally and in signifying terms of language and other forms of symbolic representation  scholars of gender and race have invented the term chilly climate to refer to the normalization of the white male experience in scientific and technical fields along with practices that produce microinequities for women and racial minorities and contribute to their status as outsiders is it possible that the sciencetechnology model promotes a corresponding chilly climate in lis one that by normalizing white experience contributes to the marginalization of librarians and library patrons of color  yet it is also in the sciencetechnology model that some of the most provocative work most notably by sanford berman has alerted librarians to the signifying work of controlled vocabularies in contributing to the normalization of whiteness  hope a olson too has drawn attention to the ways in which hierarchical subject headings marginalize racial and ethnic minorities as well as women  the businessmanagement model also sets up barriers to diversity through its structures and significations while at the same time providing opportunities to expand diversity with its emphasis on individual choice demand in economists terms and achievement the businessmanagement model systematically ignores structural factors that have combined to keep groups of minorities and women at an economic disadvantage like science business is touted as prejudice free success in management supposedly depends on merit rather than race or gender in the allocation of wealth but the reality has been different during the nineteenth century legal restrictions on the rights of women and minorities to own property prevented them from taking advantage of the main route to wealth that white males enjoyed  pp  during the twentieth century formal and informal residential segregation along with discriminatory lending policies continued to keep minorities from building home equitystill the main avenue to affluence for whites in the united states the labor market too has been segmented by race and gender in ways that still influence the question of who performs what job  pp  thus although exceptions exist in the form of affluent and successful individuals the businessmanagement model has in general failed women and racial minorities en masse yet if at the structural level the businessmanagement model has persistently privileged white males it is also at this level that this model has had a more positive effect after all it is through the creation and implementation of antidiscrimination policies that changes in the racial composition of higher educations student body have been achieved in the fifty years since the supreme courts historic  decision brown v board of education rendered the widespread practice of providing separate but equal educational facilities unconstitutional a myriad of policies written and put into effect at the managerial level have helped change the field of educational opportunity for people of color in the united states indeed alas spectrum initiative is itself a product of the businessmanagement model but as cronin and others have pointed out such policies can also go astray through a muddled and conflicted understanding of the fuzzy terms multiculturalism and diversity  p  libraries as raceneutral spaces current lis students who experience all four of the curricular models may unfortunately go through their entire graduate course work without confronting what is still one of the most pressing issues dividing american society such students will be poorly equipped to further the library professions goals of working toward justice and equity through libraries and indeed may unwittingly contribute to the persistence of inequity but it need not be so just as treating everyone nicely is not an answer to the problem of white privilege in libraries adopting a general attitude of goodwill is not an answer in lis education i suggest that as a first step we should work on decentering whiteness in the lis imagination by conceiving of libraries as nonwhite or raceneutral spaces historian david roediger believes that to overcome the divisive and unfair structures and significations inherited from the past americans need to theorize and historicize the concept of nonwhiteness in thinking about race critical studies of whiteness have shown how whiteness became a kind of property for european immigrants in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries these immigrantscorrectlysaw achieving white identity as the path to privilege success and happiness a process that has continued to the present day if the state universities employers realtors loan officers judges and police continue dramatically to privilege white people roediger comments we are very likely to remain a nation in which newcomers struggle to get into the white race and in which those already so classified opt to retain both whiteness and privilege  p  as he argues although it may be tempting to see the opening up of whiteness  as on balance a positive thing and certainly preferable to antiimmigrant racism against greeks italians jews poles and others  the process of inclusion into whiteness has always been predicated on accepting the exclusion of others  p  race is a relational concept after all what it means to decenter whiteness in lis and how we go about this in practical terms are matters we need to take up as an urgent priority the lis field is indeed capable of radical transformation we can tell this from the example of recent technological change in librarianship during the s and s it became clear that new computer technologies were mounting an urgent challenge to libraries and library education library educators recognized that to meet this challenge successfully they needed to learn from the developing field of information science and found ways to include information scientists in their schools and departments the curriculum changed shape in drastic ways as courses heavy with technological content became established and rapidly taken for granted as essential elements  pp  lis educators achieved these changes because they perceived technology as vitally important and because they carried on a conversation about technologyabout its role in libraries how best to incorporate it into the curriculum who should teach what courses and how and what sort of research lis should supporta conversation that continues to this day with the right will we can similarly prioritize race and we can choose to carry on a conversation about how to create libraries as raceneutral spaces those of us who are lis faculty members need to educate not only our students but also ourselves about race we must start by recognizing that for the purposes of combating racism our current concept of multiculturalism is too general rather we need to specify and theorize its component parts including race gender class ethnicity and sexuality few of us probably feel that we have the skills and knowledge to undertake such a task but just as library education recruited information scientists in tackling the issue of technology so lis can turn for help to those in academe who are currently carrying out exciting work on race especially in sociology history law and cultural and ethnic studies some will complain with justification that keeping up with developments in other fields is time consuming and perhaps beyond their competence but we do not have to do this alonewe can look for help the ranks of lis faculty already include scholars with qualifications and experience in disciplines other than lis and in the future will probably include more of these at a time when a shortage of doctoral students in lis is making filling faculty vacancies difficult we can look for recruits with phds in say sociology and history we can also make alliances across campus by actively making contacts with those departments that are already doing work on race as gollop points out lis deans and directors need to provide nonwhite space in their alreadycrowded curricula  p  but courses on young adult and childrens literature should not be the onlyor even the majorarena in which students confront issues of racism courses in lis foundations research methods and history are obvious candidates for this kind of critical reflection as are issuesbased courses similar to the intellectualfreedom courses implemented by among others toni samek  but each of the models has the capacity to overcome the whiteprivileged legacies of the past and to help recreate libraries as nonwhite or raceneutral spaces race canand in some schools already doesmake an appearance in courses that fall into each of the four models including the organization of information cataloging and classification and reference and collection management as well as courses in public librarianship and academic librarianship peterson has helpfully suggested six activities for incorporating multicultural considerations in the lis curriculum that she feels are particularly useful in introductory reference and management courses invite guest lecturers use role playing and small group discussion relevant to activities cited in the literature make lectures broad and inclusive give genderracialsexualityethnic inclusive assignments offer a separate course in multicultural librarianship and deliver separate lectures on information sources and services in the areas of gender ethnic sexuality and area studies  pp  lis faculty can take another step in this direction by setting aside hierarchical models of curriculum development in which they themselves constitute the main source of expertise and curricular knowledge using the principles of critical pedagogythat is the restructuring of the studentteacherknowledge relationship based on the desire to create genuine inquiry rather than the desire to transmit unquestionable knowledgelis faculty can make progress in partnership with each other as well as with students practitioners and even library users themselves  p  many students come to lis with previous training in philosophy history sociology anthropology and the humanities some already have the intellectual tools to bring to bear on issues of race and racism many also have had life experiences that have caused them to engage in critical reflexivity to borrow cronins phrase on race and racism and at least part of the lis curriculum should provide opportunities for faculty and masters as well as phd students to produce and publish creative ideas about these issues practitioners and library users too embody diverse experiences and knowledgeif only we can find a way to take advantage of these sharing ideas that we glean from other fields can add to our stock of knowledge and our repertoire of practical responses just as white individuals can test their white privilege by unpacking the invisible knapsack organizations too can assess their combat readiness in fighting racism in a recent posting to the social responsibilities round table ssrt discussion list for example librarian jonathan betzzall passed on to list members an organizational inventory for combating racism consisting of some straightforward and concrete steps that an organization can take to dismantle racism   this inventory encourages groups to consider fifteen statements including the following the organization has an ongoing change team focusing on issues of dismantling racism and guiding the process for the group and the organization sees itself as a model for other organizations and is open about its process of struggle and change it takes political will intellectual energy and practical skill first to recognize the racist legacies of lis structures and significations and then to devise ways to transform them only by deciding that racism is a problem that we can no longer afford to sideline can we even begin to tackle this monumental task whether lis education is up to the challenge is up to us   roediger recognizes that the term nonwhiteness has the potential to offend in that it seems to exemplify the tendency to place whites at the normative center of everything and to marginalize everyone else but he intends for us to think about ways in which the nation can become something other than white  p    as evelyn nakano glenn explains race and gender categories such as blackwhite womanman are positioned and therefore gain meaning in relation to each other according to poststructural analysis meaning within western epistemology is constructed in terms of dichotomous oppositions or contrasts oppositional categories require suppressing variability within each category and exaggerating difference between categories  p
