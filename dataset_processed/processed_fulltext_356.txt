the library quarterly volume xvii october  number  research libraries in the war period  i luther h evans characteristics of american libraries t _o all thoughtful americans not merely to members of the library profession it is a cause for heartfelt thanksgiving that we have come out of the most devastating war in human history with our land and cultural possessions unscathed thanks to our geographical location and even more to the watchfulness and bravery of our armed forces our cities our homes and our possessions have been spared the destruction visited upon so many other nations across the seas but global warfare has kindled in us a deeper global consciousness a freshly quickened realization of the essential interdependence of all peoples we have come to recognize a pressing moral imperative to help set the world back on its feet again and to bend our collective energies toward the firm upbuilding of the world cultural activities now as always these activities are symbolized by the care and wise use of books burn your books or what amounts to the same thing neglect your books and you will lose freedom as surely as if you were to invite hitler and his henchmen to rule over you is one of the great lessons of this war viewed in this light the librarian profession that of preserving and creatively promoting the use of man recorded knowledge is no mean one and the great libraries of this country steadily carrying on their activities in peace and in war have played no small part in keeping alive the tradition of the liberal arts it is not yet time to write the final history of what we have been doing these last six years full perspective is lacking and parts of the story are still untold but a brief chronicle of our principal activities may be of some help in sorting out our ideas about what we are engaged upon today and what we may accomplish in the postwar years the american library directory for  lists about twelve thousand libraries of various types in the united states roughly two thirds of these are public libraries some eighteen hundred are associated with colleges and universities about four hundred come under federal or state supervision and the remainder consist of hospital institutional or special collections in a sense this article was prepared at the request of the american council of learned societies wendell willkie freedom and the liberal arts in humanities after the war ed by norman foerster princeton princeton university press  p  i
 the library quarterly any library may be called a research library if it can be used at all for investigation and informational purposes but the greater the depth and spread of its collections the more valuable it is for scholarship a score of our libraries have more than a million volumes granting the existence of duplicates the quantitative figures remain formidable the major research collections in general are those that have grown up with the liberal arts colleges more than half of which have over twenty five thousand books together with certain federal institutions public libraries in some of the larger cities and a handful of specially endowed institutions few of them are devoted exclusively to the humanities or the social sciences for the character of libraries is determined by the catholic needs of readers faculties and administrators research collections today are endowed with phenomenal capacities for reproduction describable in terms of geometrical rather than arithmetical proportions students of library history have commented in particular upon the remarkable growth during the past half century of the book collections in the american college and university this has been due not only to increasing recognition through financial support of the role of the research library in educative processes particularly in graduate studybut to marked expansion in size of the academic institutions themselves requiring libraries to support additional curriculums extend their subject ranges to newly developed branches of study and strengthen their resources in already well established fields added to this has been a pressing necessity to keep pace so far as budgets allow with the ever increasing quantity of material flowing from the world presses in the form of books serial publications documents pamphlets and ephemera the presentday research library has come to represent not only the reflective memory but the active consciousness of the human race dr pierce butler comment is well worth quoting the librarian may be a technical specialist in the technologies of book preservation and use but he is never a subject specialist he is equally concerned with every ramification of every science and of every humanistic discipline not for their own sake but for the sake of scholarship as a whole the library may therefore be regarded as an integrating machine in which all the diverse intellectual factors of civilization are reduced to a single index value and library history as a running record of its fluctuations reference services during the war perhaps the easiest generalization that may be offered about the activities of research libraries during the years of national emergency and war is that their reference and book finding functions became primary for a while outstripping in daily importance their services for personal education academic research and diversion in washington the great government libraries by their very nature became key points for quick supply of information needed for the conduct of national defense and the war but total mobilization was required and a wide net was cast throughout the country for any collections having data of value for the war effort as might be expected scientific and technical materials were in greatest demand the army map service for example searching out every available scrap of geographical information on areas of military or strategic importance exhaustively inventoried the map resources of the country and established branch offices at new york chi books and libraries in wartime chicago university of chicago press  p io

 the library quarterly a year at the beginning of  it announced that it would furnish microfilms free to all government offices and to individuals connected with accredited institutions when this method of securing research material was preferred that the move was not unwelcome is evidenced by the rise in its monthly figures of pages copied from  in january  to  in the last month of the year german libraries prior to the war had been planning to supplant interlibrary loans with microfilm copying and it seems likely that the coming years will see an increasing trend in this direction in our own country in greater or lesser degree the impact of war was felt by all libraries from the largest serving an entire nation down to the small public institution ministering to its own local community population shifts produced by industrial expansion created special regional problems quiet sectors suddenly became crowded communities with a consequently larger proportion of people visiting the local library in search of reading matter or the answers to bothersome questions many in the endeavor to learn new trades came looking for vocational information industries called upon near by libraries to supply technical material the los angeles public library reported in  that its most popular subject was aeronautical engineering since more than o per cent of the nation planes were being manufactured in the surrounding area extension of the selective service act in the same year organization of civilian defense and the introduction of consumer rationing brought many requests for information on governmental regulations air raid precautions food conservation and kindred topics later war information centers were set up in many public and some college libraries to furnish quick answers these had the support of the office of war information and the united states office of education receiving special publications and exhibit material of current interest while most libraries went about their everyday business in much the same fashion as before though at greatly accelerated tempo some found occasion to extend their services to the community in a more positive manner iowa state college library in addition to supplying technical information for industrial firms and investigators prepared weekly radio broadcasts dealing with current publications publicized defensegroup programs on war bonds food conservation and allied topics and encouraged campus discussion groups the cleveland public library established an intercultural library to promote exchange of views among the different ethnic groups in its locality each nationality there were twenty four initially was assigned an alcove containing a selection of books written in its own language together with materials in english dealing with the history and culture of the group and a display of art objects the detroit public library conducted an energetic community program strikingly illustrated by its issue shortly after the much publicized local riots of june  of a guide to factual works explaining the findings of scientists on the question of race college and university libraries saw the character of their clientele considerably altered during the war by the end of  nearly five hundred academic institutions had been declared eligible centers for army and navy specialized training programs and civilian student enrolments had dropped precipitately undergraduate curriculums were accelerated and graduate studies except in
research libraries in the war period  such war priority subjects as medicinedeclined in volume as the young men of our country put on their uniforms faculty members bearing heavier teaching loads during a longer academic year or working long hours on war necessary investigations had less opportunity to carry on their peacetime studies much of the military instruction was performed by the textbook method with little or no emphasis on background reading young men who passed their days in the classroom and on the drill field found the library more valuable for recreational reading than for serious research harvard report for  is not untypical citing many of its smaller libraries either closed for the duration or turned over to the armed forces and reporting the fewest number of visiting scholars since i significantly too it points out a marked decrease in book borrowing by individuals attributed to a more than  per cent drop in graduate school enrolment coupled with absorption of undergraduates on streamlined study schedules while the mass training programs of the armed forces did not depend heavily on library resources special curriculums furnished exceptions the navy school for colonial administration at columbia university drew considerably on the new york public library outstanding files of official publications of the leading countries and their possessions a number of libraries made special efforts to increase their resources in subjects studied by trainees the university of california library for example implemented linguistic study programs by searching out dictionaries and grammars not only for chinese and japanese but also for mongolian manchurian and other less familiar tongues required by far wandering military forces purchases by academic libraries to accommodate trainees lay chiefly in such fields as aeronautics chemistry engineering medicine meteorology mathematics economics geography and foreign languages war documentation publications of our government were much in demand during wartime while the output of official material increased considerably owing to the need of acquainting the public with new laws and regulations arising from the emergency and with the vastly expanded activities of the government there was a correspondingly strong trend to shorten mailing lists and to effect economies in the printing and distribution of new material after much negotiating by the american library association and other interested bodies the office of government reports later the office of war information agreed to place some four thousand libraries of all types on its circulating list to receive publications relating to the war effort which were deemed suitable for general distribution but this left out the large number which were issued in confidential and secret editions or run off in near print form with such limited circulation that libraries were unable to secure copies with the end of the war strenuous attempts have been made to track down enough of these to stock at least the main depositories and research centers of the country the army and navy have agreed to release i copies of each of their departmental publications for distribution through the library of congress as they become down graded from the secret confidential and restricted categories the office of scientific research and development has made similar arrangements in the case of some three million copies of its wartime issues and it is hoped that other agencies
 the library quarterly will follow suit libraries are benefiting from termination of other national wartime activities the army map service plans to place sets of thousands of its maps in some i o research centers throughout the country the office of war information has turned over its enormous collection of photographs of the american scene to the library of congress and the office of censorship as soon as the war ended released about ooo books accumulated in the course of its work government production of motion pictures during the war years has been prodigious in the middle i it was calculated that about seventeen thousand reels of film were in government custody in  the figure was set at sixty thousand and it had multiplied to three hundred thousand in i even the latter is dwarfed by the one million reels of surplus i millimeter film estimated to be on hand at the end of t to say nothing of uncounted  millimeter negatives and surplus  millimeter prints in co operation with the national archives and the museum of modern art in new york city which had been performing pioneer work in collecting cinema material for historical research the library of congress created a national motion picture archive in i it will be world wide in scope accumulating material without restriction as to subject title or field of knowledge in addition to government transfers the archive includes paper prints of some thirty five hundred motion pictures deposited for copyright between i and ii the incunabula of the cinema industry and a selection of some nine hundred titles chosen each year from entertainment and documentary films produced in the united states and abroad thus it will preserve for future historians a first hand record of the changing aspects of today world the significance of the motion picture as an organ of expression an instrument for conveying information and a serious subject for research is becoming increasingly recognized special topical collections have long been put to effective use by the american museum of natural history the theodore roosevelt memorial association the wistar institute and other organizations visual education departments now operate in colleges and universities of virtually every state in the union one of their wartime services was helping the treasury and the office of war information with distribution of films explaining matters of public interest the cleveland public library went one step further by establishing a film lending library in i using materials from the office of war information the national film board of canada and the office of the co ordinator of interamerican affairs it seems clear as a result of the vast improvements in the technique of informing and educating through motion pictures which have been achieved by our armed forces that this medium is going to take a significant place in the scheme of postwar instruction and in consequence will be of growing concern to librarians development of cinema collections is only one indication of the attention that has been devoted to documenting the present research libraries have realized that it is not only obligatory but economical to accumulate anything bearing on the war while it has actually been in progress rather than to wait for some future time when much printed and written matter will have become rare or have totally disappeared from view when the united states entered the war a central committee on conservation of cultural
research libraries in the war period  resources was formed in washington stemming from the national resources planning board composed of custodians of the federal government cultural scientific and historical possessions joining together with members of professional organizations it gave much publicity to the need for preserving war significant data however ephemeral in nature similar committees were organized in various states to offer more specific advice many libraries had already begun the undertaking in a systematic way the largest special collections at the present time are those of the hoover library on war revolution and peace which had long since become pre eminent for the study of communism fascism national socialism and other vital movements flowing from the first world war and of yale university library which early in the critical period had asked alumni all over the world to send in anything of relevance at the university of illinois washington and lee university and a score of other centers there is now a wealth of pamphlets letters books and propaganda matter through which the multifarious aspects of the war may be explored in washington the amount of material accumulated by the library of congress and the national archives is prodigious and it is noteworthy that the war department and many agencies directly connected with the national effort not only have gone to great length to conserve their records but have set up special units of writers to sift their vast files and prepare written histories of their complex activities acquisitions from overseas in their endeavor to gather essential materials libraries have been confronted with the insurmountable problem of being largely shut off from foreign sources of supply the war has emphasized how interdependent is the world of scholarship and how greatly we had been relying upon acquisitions from other countries to support advanced research in america half of the annual expenditures of our libraries prior to the war were in foreign markets a recent survey has shown that some four thousand scientific and technical periodicals alone were on order in  and  from germany italy japan and the nations of europe and asia which had been overrun by the axis great gaps now exist in our files of books and learned journals after the war in europe began most libraries chose to have material for which they had placed orders stored on the continent rather than risk losses in the uncertainties of transatlantic shipping whether it has survived is only now being determined by a mission we have sent to locate stockpiles in leipzig and other central european cities during ii scattered consignments of books were still arriving via lisbon or siberia for such institutions as the newberry library which kept contact with agents abroad but after pearl harbor it was only from great britain that libraries continued to receive direct shipments on a scale comparable to that of the pre war period the library of congress thanks to energetic representatives operating overseas with the help of military and state department authorities has alone managed to keep a stream of material flowing in from europe africa and asia but between what it has acquired and what it needs to satisfy research demands there is still a huge gulf while individual libraries were barred during the war from securing what they needed from enemy and enemy occupied countries government intelligence and scientific investigation insistently de
