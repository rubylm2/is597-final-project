the impact of differing orientations of librarians on the process of children book selection a case study of library tensions joseph turow this paper represents an attempt to apply current organizational theory to the understanding of a large juvenile library system selection goals and guidelines writings on goal conflict within organizations suggest that the two groups characteristically involved in a large library book selection process the coordinators and branch librarians would display differing orientations toward the process which would result in conflicting objectives and organizational tensions a case study using nonparticipant observation interviews and a questionnaire survey was carried out to examine this hypothesis the findings challenge the traditional view of forces guiding book selection in a children library there is a great deal of writing on children books and much of it is related to the selection of titles for public and school libraries however while specific reviews of juvenile titles abound and general normative prescriptions for the selection of titles are issued regularly relatively little literature exists on the organizational factors which guide librarians to purchase certain books over others studies which do deal with organizational influences on selection for example      are generally directed toward the question of library censorship a sanction that is only one facet of the overall selection process moreover such studies tend to concentrate on quantifiable conclusions about large often unrelated populations no work could be found which views a children library as an organizational system and attempts to chart the influences which guide book purchasing activities of librarians as they interact within that system the investigation to be reported here represents an attempt to apply the holistic interactional perspective of current organizational theory to the understanding of a large juvenile library system selection goals and guidelines through nonparticipant observations interviews and a questionnaire survey the selection interests and activities of the library personnel wvere examined as expected from organizational theory two different orientations toward the library world were found among the two groups of librarians in the system orientations which reflected the library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago    
process of children book selection  confluence of different and often conflictingintraorganizational and extraorganizational pressures the different selection goals of the two groups the process of new book selection to carry out the goals the actual selection and rejection of new titles and even the images librarians had of the children who read the purchased titles were seen to result from these orientations from the tensions they raised and from structural as well as procedural attempts to mitigate those tensions the study findings raise some important challenges to the traditional view of forces guiding children book selection and point to unexplored areas for further research the conceptual framework asking about the influences which guide the members of any organization to perform certain activities necessarily involves asking about the organizational goals they hold the factors which shape those goals and the consequences of those goals for organizational operations theorists have pointed out that few if any organizations have only one goal in fact complex organizations often have subunits that develop interests and goals which are independent of the aims of other subunits and sometimes even of the organization as a whole see especially d furthermore writers agree that in such common goal differentiations lie the seeds of intraorganizational conflict march and simron  p  for example have written that a necessary condition for intraorganizational conflict exists when subunits involved in joint decision making have different perceptions of reality and possibly as a consequence of such varying orientations different goals pondy  moving somewhat further along these lines has specified three types of conflict bargaining conflict bureaucratic conflict and systems conflict that can be expected among various types of subunits in formal organizations bureaucratic conflict for example takes place between parties involved in a superior subordinate relationship because subordinates cannot rely on superiors always to identify sufficiently with subordinate goals a measure of autonomy becomes important to subordinates who resist attempts by superiors to control some of their subunit operations pondy sees conflict as a dynamic process that advances from a latent stage characterized by the existence of conditions necessary for conflict to stages in which organizational tensions are both felt and perceived by members to a stage in which those tensions erupt inlto manifest conflict however he notes that just as an organization tends to evolve ways to routinize nonargumentative decisions so it develops ways of
 the library quarterly managing tension in order to minimize the frequency of conflict and reduce its severity when it flares he points out that minor conflicts generate pressures toward a resolution which does not change fundamental organizational relationships on the other hand major conflicts ultimately force alteration or dissolution of those relationships the foregoing paragraphs are relevant to an understanding of factors which guide children book selection in a large public library as a formal organization a library can be expected to exhibit the same kinds of tensions that are evident in other formally structured entities concern in a library with interaction between subunits is especially relevant because the activity of book selection in a large library is characteristically the joint decision making concern of two groups the branch librarians and coordinating librarians who oversee this process using the theory outlined above it can be predicted that an investigation of book selection goals held by the two groups would reveal competing orientations toward book selection which result in conflicting objectives and consequent organizational tensions it can further be predicted that in pondy terms these tensions lead to latent bureaucratic conflict that is made manifest at intervals by the breakdown of routinized tensionmanagement procedures the library studied a case study seemed the best way to carry out an initial examination of these hypotheses despite the problem of generalizing findings from a single library it was felt that an intensive investigation into the workings of one library system could reveal tensions and procedures that a necessarily more superficial survey of many systems might miss a large city public library was the site of research conducted during the fall of  and the spring of  the city is an ethnically diverse urban center that has more than a million people and is located in the northeastern section of the united states its public library system founded before the turn of the twentieth century has two major book buying and distributing arms oriented toward different audiences the adultyoung adult services division and the juvenile services division the entire library has about  million volumes in stock nearly a million of which belong to the juvenile division in  that division was responsible for about   million book loans the juvenile services division and the adultyoung adult services division share space in the library fifty sections which include forty six branches a bookmobile service a service which deposits books in schools with no libraries and which lends books to the handicapped a regional branch and a central branch the branches are meant to serve specific
process of children book selection  neighborhoods within the city the three special service areas are designed to make the library more accessible to children and adults who cannot easily use it and the regional library is equipped to serve the broad and specialized needs of a large district far from the central branch the nerve centers of the juvenile services and the adultyoung adult services divisions are their system coordinating offices scos which oversee work carried out in the units the purpose of both scos is to direct divisional planning and policy to coordinate the selection processing and purchasing of books records and film strips in all units and to initiate and carry out various entertainent programs for their audiences throughout the year the head of the juvenile sco controls the entire range of the juvenile division activities although she is ultimately responsible to the directors and associate director of the entire library the head of sco is a nationally known figure who has been at her position for over a decade and according to the director has considerable autonomy in determining policies within the juvenile division the head of sco delegates much of the day to day responsibility of the book record and film selection processes to her head of book selection who in turn has two coordinators of lower rank to help her an area coordinator also plays an active role in the selection of books particularly in the regional library and the branches surrounding it the coordinators are former branch librarians with several years experience who took special civil service tests to work in the sco and advance to one of three levels there there are also three professional grades in the branches beginners who must have a master degree in library science start at level  and by passing competitive examinations may advance to assistant branch head level  or branch head level  when an appropriate position is vacant it should be noted that not every branch has a children librarian insufficient funding and difficulties of staffing the central branch have resulted in forty five professional librarians being located in only forty four of the fifty sections the central branch has two professional librarians in the branches without librarians lower paid technicians care for the juvenile collection and help children choose books the book selection procedure the selection of books that end up on branch shelves takes place through a two stage process in the first stage books are examined for general acceptability to the juvenile division as a whole every month the branch librarians and the coordinators choose or more rarely are assigned newly arrived titles to review in writing for the next book
 the library quarterly selection committee meeting wvhich is held monthly from september to june after perusing the books this committee of eleven which is chaired by the head of book selection and is comprised of her two assistants the area coordinator and an annually rotating panel of branch librarians decides whether any reviewer recommendations on system acceptance or rejection of a title should be contested a second careful review by another librarian might be suggested the majority decision by the committee must be approved by and can be vetoed by either the head of book selection or the head of sco after these selection decisions are made a list is drawn up which indicates the final status of each book the branch librarians then come to the sco to decide which of the accepted books they would like to buy for their particular branches branches without children librarians have their books bought for them by the sco librarians the regional area coordinator or the additional librarian in the central branch during this branch selection process the librarians are encouraged to examine the books as well as to read the staff reviews of each when all the branch orders are completed at the end of the month they are sent to the library system acquisitions department where they are consolidated and assigned to a jobber or jobbers the book selection head estimates that most titles end up on branch shelves approximately six months after publication date the method of study as noted earlier the aim of the present study was to chart the influences guiding the juvenile librarians book selection activities more specifically the purpose was to understand their selection goals delineate the organizational and extraorganizational factors that shape those goals and note how those goals are translated into specific selection guidelines and activities four methods were used to achieve this aim the interview the questionnaire survey nonparticipant observation and the examination of formal library documents the first two were the most systematic and elaborate interviews were conducted with all four coordinators and fifteen of the branch librarians the one third sample of branch personnel was chosen through an accidental selection of those visiting sco to select new books the questionnaire was mailed to all librarians including the nineteen interviewed to fill out anonymously and return by mail the interviews most interviews ranged from forty five minutes to an hour in length though several were longer and a few were shorter in the first part the
process of children book selection  librarian was asked to describe her professional activities and goals the second part dealt with specific details of book selection at each stage of the two stage operation first for each of nineteen characteristics of titles or groups of titles that might be relevant to the interviewee during the sco book review interviewees were asked  how influential they thought they themselves were in affecting decisions involving each characteristic at the sco level  how important they thought each characteristic was when they were themselves making decisions at the sco level and  what general guidelines they themselves followed with respect to each characteristic and why in making selection decisions see table  then similar questions about the nineteen characteristics were asked regarding the librarian branch selection activities the section ended with a query about any controversial issues on children books that have affected the librarian and her work luring the past year followed by another on the librarian image of the people who read her books and the way she arrived at that image  the third part of the interview attempted to gauge the librarian contact with members of the publishing industry her opinions about children books currently published and her feelings about the titles table  title and list characteristics influencing the review process  the size of the selection list  the relative selection of fiction and nonfiction titles  the relative selection of fantasy and reality titles  the relative selection of books for general audiences vs titles for particular ethnic andor racial groups  the relative selection of books for different ages andor grades  the author and illustrator  the subject of the book  the plot  the illustrations  the characters and the way they are portrayed probe on preferences regarding racial mix animal vs people sexual mix  the moral point of view  the style probe on poetry vs prose first or third person narration use of curse words vocabulary difficulty control  the accuracy  the size of the book probe on dimensions length  the binding of the book  the cover art of the book  the overall design probe on typography margin sizes frontispiece design quality of paper  the price  the paperback format  the female pronoun is used because all of the librarians in this study are women
 the library quarterly her library accepts and rejects from among those published the interviewee was asked about meetings with editors and salespeopleand about the value she places on such meetings she was asked if there are any types of books she wants but cannot find and she was asked if in her opinion there have been any books or types of books which have been rejected by the juvenile division but should have been accepted these questions were followed by a last group which asked about the librarian professional background her rank number of years worked most recent degree undergraduate major affiliation with professional associations and conference attendance each interview was recorded and the results were transcribed analysis was conducted by grouping all answers to each question together and comparing them for similarities and differences of response answers by coordinators and branch personnel were grouped separately and compared as were answers by branch personnel of different ranks and years of experience an interesting picture resulted of influences which shape particular selection goals and guidelines within the juvenile services division the questionnaire survey a questionnaire survey attempted to ascertain the generalizability to the system as a whole of what had been found about the division book selection process as a result of the interviews the detailed questionnaire completed by thirty five librarians was similar in thrust to the interview schedule in the first part each respondent was presented with a list of forty influencespeople groups facts and feelingsthat were mentioned by at least five of the interviewees as relevant to library selection activities at the sco level the branch level or both the respondent  the influences were the total book buying budget of the division your branch book buying budget the opinions of sco librarians who read the book the kirkus review of the book reviews of the book in professional review media other than kirkus your opinion of the librarian who wrote the sco review applies to branch level only the reputation of the author the reputation of the illustrator the reputation of the book publisher the head of sco the head of book selection at sco your personal likes and dislikes your branch current circulation figures your general philosophy of what children ought to read your general impressions about what the city children like to read your general impressions about what children who come to your branch like to read ethnic and racial minorities from around the city ethnic and racial minorities from your branch area older children who are slow readers advanced readers the potential popularity of the book in terms of circulation the extent to which the book is of very high quality the size of the month selection list the cost of the book the extent to which the book will balance your collection the moral point of view in the book the library trustees or directors parent teacher organizations library science students who borrow books parents who borrow books teachers who borrow books school assignments given to students the books which school libraries
process of children book selection  was asked to note whether each influence is usually very important somewhat important or not important at all when reviewing books for sco similarly she was asked to note the importance of those same influences when performing branch level selection part  of the questionnaire focused on the choosing of books for a branch and on some of the activities that take place in the branch the respondent was asked about the adequacy of her book buying budget about any conflicts she feels between buying potentially popular titles and buying high quality titles and the direction in which she would prefer to resolve such a conflict if it were to arise a question about the desirability of introducing the nancy drew series which has been rejected consistently by the library was followed by two questions about the perceived importance of branch circulation statistics and several queries about the librarian interactions with children and parents in the branch in part  of the questionnaire a series of questions was posed about the librarian contacts with representatives of the publishing world and perceptions of her division influence in that world the final part consisted of the background questions asked in the interview with the addition of queries about the general socioeconomic status and juvenile reading abilities in the respondent branch area as in the case of the interviews answers by coordinators and branch librarians were grouped separately and compared other background characteristics were also cross tabulated with answers about influences and activities to ascertain if those characteristics were more likely than sco or branch position to be associated with differences in response among the librarians the survey results and the interview results on similar issues were compared conclusions from that analysis were supplemented by impressions from nonparticipant observation of library selection activities including the sco book review meetings which were closed to the public as well as by information from formal library documents about book selection procedures the findings converged to reveal a fascinating picture of selection tensions rooted ultimately in librarians competing orientations toward the library world orientations to selection as predicted the librarians orientations were closely associated with the coordinator and branch positions within the library system and by carry the potential use of the book in a book talk the use of the book in a book fair potential complaints from parents people or pressures from city or state government publishers book fairs your training in library school promotional material from the publisher
 the library quarterly extension with the structure of the juvenile division of the system itself the different outlooks connected to this bureaucratic structural separation can be described in the cosmopolitan and local terms which merton  used to distinguish the orientations of different types of opinion leaders the sco librarians were cosmopolitan in perspective that is they were interested in and committed to the larger world of librarianship and publishing and they saw the whole library importance in terms of that world by contrast the branch personnel had a local orientation they tended to be much less interested in outside matters and saw the needs of individual branch locales as the most important areas of concern this difference in orientation was closely tied to a differential emphasis on selection goals the sco librarians tended to stress the importance of a work quality while branch librarians tended consistently to stress the importance of a title potential enjoyability or its potential popularity the specific meanings which librarians invested quality and popularity will be reviewed later in this paper as influences which guided different approaches to selection are discussed nevertheless a quantitative indication that popularity was indeed more important to branch personnel than to coordinators is possible while twenty nine  percent of the thirty two branch librarians who responded to the branch questionnaire listed general impressions of what children like as very important in the selection of books for their branch none of the three coordinators who responded to that part of the questionnaire in their capacities as book buyers for outlets without children librarians thought it more than somewhat important influences shaping the different orientations and goals this dissimilarity of orientation and emphasis on selection goals can be traced to the differential impact of certain organizational influences upon the two groups of librarians one influence that impinges more upon branch personnel than coordinators is the allocation of  percent of the book purchasing funds in direct proportion to a branch circulation figures while the coordinators tended to play down the importance of this factor and stressed that discretionary cash is often used to help branches with low circulation some branch librarians were not sanguine about their chances of maintaining or increasing their budgets without maintaining or increasing their circulation of the thirty five respondents eight  percent said that current circulation figures are very important considerations when they select books for their localities
process of children book selection  while fourteen  percent described this information as somewhat important eleven answered not important and two stated no opinion one librarian who had worked in the system for twenty two years suggested that concern over circulation is more widespread than these responses indicate when she observed that every branch librarian is under pressure to a certain extent to keep circulation up for the branch librarians interviewed who were most aware of it this pressure was judged a book selection requirement they reasoned that the allocation of funds according to circulation directs them toward the consideration of only minimum standards of quality in a search for books which promise to turn over most quickly the different outlooks of coordinators and branch librarians were seen to be reinforced by their varied contact with the publishing world data from the questionnaire and interview surveys indicate that while all the coordinators frequently attend library conferences are often in contact with editors and other publishers representatives and know quite a bit about current happenings within the children book industry the majority of branch librarians rarely go to conferences speak to publishing people or know very much about the industry or its imprints the head of sco noted she is well aware of promotional tactics that impinge upon her and her sco associates during their interactions with publishers representatives she considered however that influences are two way by allowing publishers to ask favors of her such as the review of manuscripts and promote books to the branch libraries through her she receives the opportunity of making a mark on their activities and in essence of helping them define quality in fact the desire to be influential in heralding and defining quality within the publishing and library world was seen by the coordinators as an important reason for maintaining the library system national reputation as a repository for the best juvenile titles still another important influence seen to shape the difference in orientation and emphasis on selection goals was the close interaction of the branch personnel with children an interaction which the sco librarians because of the administrative nature of their positions do not enjoy several branch interviewees noted that working on the floor listening to children requests helping students with school assignments and dealing firsthand with the low reading abilities of many of them yield a perspective which shifts the foremost emphasis of book selection from quality to popularity one librarian echoed the view of a number of her branch colleagues when she noted coordinators don get out on the branch floors that much so there is sometimes a gap in what the librarians on the floor perceive and what they that is the coordinators think is going on i think there is a tremendous gap
 the library quarterly sometimes branch librarians as a group were aware of this difference in orientation and many saw their primacy of response to children as determining it the goal of quality not all influences impinging upon the branch librarians were seen as explaining the difference in primary selection goals between them and the coordinators two major complementary influences were observed as pushing the branch librarians in the direction of recognizing the importance of quality to the extent that fourteen  percent noted it as very important for branch selection sixteen  percent said that it is somewhat important and only one considered it not important at all one influence library school training was spontaneously noted by a few of the interviewed although that experience was considered very important for branch selection by only seven  percent of the survey respondents nineteen others  percent thought it somewhat important it was in library school that many guidelines for quality were formally introduced to the respondents librarians stressed that every book acceptance is contingent on its moral and developmental appropriateness for the intended audience there was a general unanimity among coordinators and branch personnel regarding moral point of view they disapproved of books they considered obviously dogmatic or  the reader will observe that such seemingly important extralibrary and extradivisional bodies as parent teacher organizations the city and state governments and the library director and trustees have not been noted as structuring the orientations or primary selection goals of the system librarians this ommission is in accordance with the failure of any interviewee to indicate that they were significant except with regard to the routine initial provision of funds to sco and in line with their being among the factors considered not important by over  percent of the questionnaire respondents it should be pointed out however that these answers do not reflect the implicit encompassing influences of the abovementioned entities as the library system key patrons the city and state governments as the pressure groups which impinge upon the patrons ptas and others or as the system managerial links between its patrons and its operations the director and the trustees one may therefore speculate that if these and other key establishment figures experienced displeasure with the division approach to book selection their displeasure would at the very least be taken as an invitation seriously to reexamine and perhaps restructure the entire process when interviewed however the library director did note that the reputation and expertise of the sco head have led him to give virtual autonomy in selection to her and since there has not been a critical incident in the recent past in which extraorganizational factors have significantly challenged the division activities the librarians had no cause to consider patrons or pressure groups when reviewing or choosing books
process of children book selection  moralistic they pointed out that themes involving drugs heterosexual activity homosexuality abortion racial discrimination race relations and gang warfare along with curse words have been found in titles which the division has accepted however it seems that titles on such topics have been confined predominantly to middleand upper juvenile readers grades four through eight and that the librarians believe the books should contain thoughtful positive moral positions even if they do not contain happy endings several interviewees also recalled that certain types of books are specifically prohibited by the sco selection policy handbook how to manuals on subjects such as judo and hypnotism which can cause serious injury unless carefully supervised by an expert are barred and titles relating to specific religious teachings or practices are excluded since the library considers the child spiritual development as primarily the responsibility of his homne and church high quality though related to such moral and developmental values was particularly associated with literary highly aesthetic and distinctive books by the same token cartoonish illustrations and series book formatspopular features of department store juveniles were judged formulaic and generally unacceptable changing perceptions of quality in the publishing world and the national library scene were communicated to the branch personnel by the coordinators the sco provided continual reinforcement for the general goal of quality in periodic formal and informal meetings between itself and branch librarians pragmatic incentive for branch librarians purchase of titles highly approved by the coordinating office was found in the coordinators annual inspection of the branches and scrutiny of all large book replacement orders the purpose of this inspection was to maintain control over the reputation of the entire collection it should be stressed however that despite these influences branch librarians regarded quality as secondary to popularity in guiding selection moreover while library school training and reinforcement of the necessity of quality by the coordinators did make considerations of literary value important in establishing minimum standards for title acceptability those influences did not seem to shift the branch personnel toward a more cosmopolitan orientation most remained staunchly local and were quite aware of the generally conflicting orientation of their superiors the following is a representative remark i think they that is the coordinators are concerned a little too much with quality over popularity not just quality but name authors and publishers and illustrators and things like that out in the branches we don think about publishers but in sco they do and they know what kinds of publishers are doing what kinds of stuff
 the library quarterly selection orientation and audience images the local and cosmopolitan orientations of the two groups of librarians and the different selection goals associated with those orientations were seen to structure different approaches to and conceptions of the children who read the library system books the branch librarians tended to speak about children in terms of catagories sex age reading level and sometimes race that had to be met during selection they used those categories to purchase books according to a notion of balancethe choosing of titles from a book list so as to cover a wide range of audience groups popularity was often defined with balance in mind it was taken to mean the high circulation of a title among the particular audience category for which it was intended thus for example branch personnel said they try to choose monster books joke books car books and books on world war ii for older boys while also taking care to get modern romances and some types of fantasy for older girls in general the lower a librarian budget the more she characterized as difficult an adherence to the idea of balance regarding a great number of audience categories in such cases the children were placed into only one or two categories for making selection decisions in contrast to the branch personnel demographic view of its readership the scjo librarians tended to stress a generalized conception of children as sharing particular needs such as the need to be enriched by different types of special aesthetic experiences since the coordinators had worked in the branches at one time and were continuing to order books for outlets without children librarians they recognized pragmatically the necessity for audience categories however the specificity with which branch librarians discussed their selection activities in terms of these categories was not found among coordinators who admitted they don get out on the floor very much and have to rely on feedback from branch personnel for information about what is popular in one respect then the coordinators inability to appreciate the branch personnel perspective on the audience was related to their inability to identify comfortably with that group local orientation however the sco librarians emphasis on the aesthetic or other needs of children could also be seen to derive from their cosmopolitan viewpoint and its associated selection goal of quality the head of sco interpreted the branch people penchant for clearly popular titles as simply indicating they prefer to choose what seems to be what children want by what they say they want or take out in view of the choices they have at the time she said unusual titles that will give children a feel for true artistry can be successfully introduced to them particularly if a good librarian is doing the experimenting
process of children book selection  orientation and the selection process it will be recalled from the theory outlined at the outset of this paper that an organization can be expected to evolve ways of routinizing the management of structural tensions so as to minimize the frequency and severity of manifest conflict in the case of the library system under discussion overt tensions because of different orientations selection goals and audience images were both highlighted and mitigated by the division two stage system level and branch level selection routine sources and surceasers of tension each level of the two tiered procedure called attention to one of the competing primary requirements for selection data from the questionnaire survey corroborated as widespread the opinions of several interviewees that their main concern when reviewing a book for system level selection is the extent to which the book is of very high quality twentythree  percent of the responding branch librarians thought this criterion very important at this stage of reviewing while only eleven  percent felt that way about general impressions of what the city children like to read in striking contrast when asked about branch level selection thirty  percent of the branch personnel felt that general impressions about what children in their branch areas like to read are very important while only thirteen  percent thought the high quality statement rated that description despite their general acceptance of the quality goal as a basis for system level selection several branch personnel evidenced some annoyance with coordinators activities at that stage they referred to instances in which the head of sco overrode their unfavorable reviews as well as the book selection committee concurrence with the unfavorable reviews and accepted titles allegedly because of friendship with or personal esteem for an author or illustrator the branch librarians said that in response to such actions they simply do not buy those titles for their branches the books are purchased only for the central library more distressing the interviewees noted are the somewhat more frequent cases where titles they and the book selection committee have reviewed favorably are vetoed by the book selection head or the head of sco for reasons of unacceptable quality generally speaking however the process of book selection within the library system was considered flexible enough to ensure coordinator control over minimum requirements for acceptability which are ordinarily agreeable to branch personnel while also mitigating much of the tension between the two groups as to whether quality or popularity should come first the tension that arises over titles of very high quality
 the library quarterly which branch personnel believe will not be popular in their branches is alleviated by allowing those librarians to decide upon the particular books to purchase for their branches at the same time the chance that a book which is clearly unacceptable to coordinators will be deemed acceptable to branch librarian reviewers and expose this undercurrent of tension is reduced through the private screening of books by the head of book selection before they are even put up for sco review the book selection head explained this activity in which she excludes titles which obviously do not meet her minimum standards with a rhetorical question why waste someone time with something from a cheap press that i know we don need open conflict regarding selection despite the general reduction of tension which the two tiered selection process encourages flare ups which force the librarians of the system to confront their differences in orientation do occur during the course of this study for example manifest conflict arose over the acceptability of the nancy drew series picture books by richard scarry currently the best selling children book author illustrator in book and department stores and easy readers with fixed word lists significantly these books had been consistently rejected by sco while being constantly requested of the branch librarians by many children and parents who had become familar with them through nonlibrary sources the heads of sco and book selection who pointed out their experience in handling these matters dealt with each of the three instances in a different manner since knowledge about the requests for easy word list readers had not yet pervaded the system the book selection head felt that explanatory action was premature she seemed confident however that such books which she believed to have a consistently stilted style will continue to be rejected in the case of richard scarry books which the coordinators considered repetitious and cluttered demand on the part of branch librarians had become so strong that after two years of routine rejection the coordinators agreed to accept one of his titles on a trial ostensibly to gauge children reactions to the books such a procedure indicates explicitly that the title involved is an exception and that a redefinition of the boundaries of quality has not occurred it also gives notice that a precedent has not been made with regard to the evaluation of other scarry books the coordinators refused to allow a test of the nancy drew series since the individual titles are numbered and to accept one would be to invite children to ask for others however an angry letter signed by a large number of librarians asking sco to allow purchase of nancy drew books caused the head coordinator to schedule a meeting to deal with the nmatter more generally convinced that the petitioners had not
process of children book selection  read a book from the series since childhood and evidently aiming to show the librarians that the newer editions are even worse than the older ones the head of sco asked all of them to read an ol and new drew book for the meeting each person was asked to stand and state her opinion of the books it is of course impossible to know how the format of the gathering with its requirement of a public profession influenced the responses of the branch librarians to the books at any rate none of them spoke in favor of nancy drew at the meeting or in answering this study questionnaire speaking about the nancy drew series the head of sco gave a pragmatic monetary reason for wanting to reject those books if the system accepted them the branches would continually be buying the many titles in the series and replacing them as they wore out the substantial sums invested in this way would preclude purchase of high quality books which deserve to be bought in essence then sco authority was used to manage this and the other conflicts so that the cosmopolitan orientation of the coordinators and its attendant selection goal of quality were ultimately more influential in the system than the local orientation of the branch librarians and its selection goal of popularity concluding remarks the findings of this study shed a somewhat unusual light on the book selection activity of children librarians most writing on children book selection is self congratulatory in tone and implies that those connected with the distribution of juvenile titles through libraries are guided by a unanimous desire to create a reading environment for the child which will be the source of everlasting growth and delight  p  the present study through the instance of one large system challenges this assumption by pointing to the pragmatic organizational and extraorganizational concerns which have important consequences for book selection through their influence on the orientation of librarians toward the selection process organizational theory it has been noted points up the likelihood of bureaucratic tensions in all multiunit library divisions of course examination of other systems is necessary to determine if the particular competing perspectives and goals observed in the systern under study here can be found elsewhere and if so under what conditions the findings of this study suggest that the adoption of a cosmopolitan or local orientation by a group of children librarians depends on the relative influence of three factors the extent of the group contact with the library world library market publishers and library schools the reading level and other relevant features of young people who visit the
 the library quarterly library and the degree to which library funding is tied to circulation figures greater awareness of organizational and extraorganizational pressures upon children libraries will lead to a much better understanding of fundamental though often quite implicit concerns involved in the selection of books this understanding will aid library administrators to confront and if desirable to alleviate certain tensions and conflicts within their systems moreover an explicit recognition of competing orientations and goals might lead to more critical and novel questions about the purpose of children librarianship and might spark ideas which will add new dimensions to the discussion of children book selection references  broderick dorothy m roblem nonfiction library journal  october     busha charles the attitudes of midwestern public librarians towards intellectual freedom and censorship phd dissertation indiana university   eakin may l censorship in public high school libraries ma thesis columbia university   moon eric roblem fiction libraryjournal  january     tamblyn eldon w they play it safe library journal  june     selznick p foundations of the theory of organization american sociological review  january     march james g and simon herbert a organizations new york john wiley  sons   pondy louis r organizational conflict concepts and models administrative science quarterly  september     merton robert k patterns of influence in communication research   edited by paul lazersfeld and frank stanton new york harper  bros   gross elizabeth h public library service to children dobbs ferry ny oceana publications
