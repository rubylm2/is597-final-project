trends in children literature mary k eakin d uring the thirties many librarians teachers and parents rejoiced in what seemed to them to be a golden flow of children books the movement toward the establishment of school libraries and especially of elementary school libraries the increased awareness on the part of classroom teachers of the possibilities of using library books in a wide variety of teaching situations and the recognition by publishers of the potentialities of children books as big business all contributed to the flow and to its encouragement the steady increase in the number of children books published each year was not confined to fiction numerous books on science nature study history handicrafts sports travel geography biography and many other subjects appeared and some of them even made bids for recognition as children literature as might be expected the majority of the informational books published during the thirties have not lasted to the present day this was due in part to the fact that many authors were still clinging to the old outmoded pattern of presenting their information in a highly fictionalized form adults had not yet come to realize that children not only are capable of accepting and understanding facts as facts but even prefer to have their information given in a straightforward manner furthermore much of the material dealt with in these books is no longer accurate or up to date as new advances have been made in science and medicine and the events of history have brought political and social changes to most countries however a few of the informational books published in the thirties have come to be regarded as standard titles in their fields alice dalgliesh america travels macmillan  gives the young reader a vivid picture of one hundred years of travel in the united states william maxwell reed earth for sam harcourt brace  and robert baker when the stars come out viking  are as useful today for introducing young readers to the wonders of the earth and sky as when they were first published roger duvoisin and there was america knopf  brings to life many of the early explorers of america through simple but dramatic text and glowing colorful illustrations although a considerable amount of biography for children was published during the thirties much of it was of the written to order merchandising type which had little to recommend it at the time of publication and no hope or excuse for lasting through the years again as with the informational books there were a few notable exceptions james daugherty daniel boone viking  janette eaton leader by destiny george washington man and patriot harcourt brace  elizabeth janet gray penn viking  cornelia meigs invincible louisa little brown  and con

 the library quarterly creasing use of a variety of materials in modern teaching which has both stimulated and been stimulated by the development of elementaryand secondary school libraries has resulted in demands for more trade books both fiction and nonfiction publishers increasingly aware that children books are big business are encouraging and even commissioning authors and are developing new methods of selling and book promotion the major factors whose effect was felt during the thirties have continued to work together toward an increase in the number of children books published in subsequent years more important than the number of books published is their content during the last six years the center for children books has analyzed and evaluated  of the  books published for children in   and it is on the basis of this analysis that trends in children books are indicated the figures that follow will show few if any startlingly new developments in children books they will however indicate areas of emphasis in published books and will suggest some fields in which a need for good books still exists the  titles represent a range from preschool years to middle adolescence for convenience they have been divided into four groupings kindergarten grade i grades ii iv grades v vii grades viii x tenth grade is used as a top grading since the majority of the students in the eleventh and twelfth grades read books which are predominantly adult titles and the so called teen age books are read most widely at the sixthand seventhgrade levels and seldom above the tenth grade level a major portion of the fiction titles were written at the eighthto tenth grade level with books for the level of grades ii iv ranking next followed by those for the fifthto seventh grade level books at the kindergarten grade i level are not considered as fiction and will be discussed as a separate grouping the same pattern prevailed for the total number of fiction titles published during each year with the exception of  and  when the grades v vii group ranked second and the grades ii iv group dropped to third in rank in  there were only two more titles in the grades viii x group than in the grades vvii group the increase in books for the fifthto seventh grade level in  was due in large part to the increase in titles in the reprint series since most of the books in such series are intended for the middle elementary grades the increase for the fifthto seventhgrade level in  was also due to series books but not to reprint series the year  witnessed the unprecedented and often unwelcome mushrooming of publishers series of original titles and the books in most of these series were designed for readers at the fifthto seventh grade level of the informational books published in the period from  to  the largest number fell in the grades vvii class actually this class ranked first in only one year  but in that year it accounted for  per cent of the total as with fiction the sudden spurt in informational books at the fifthto seventh grade level during  can be traced primarily to the sharp increase in number of publishers series and reflects the growing awareness of a need for simply written but highly interesting materials and of the need so often expressed by teachers for trade books to be used in connec

trends in children literature  numbers of books are published which are too condescending in tone and too juvenile in subject matter for the readers who might be able to handle the text too difficult for the beginning readers who might find the subjects of interest and too poorly written to be suitable for reading aloud to young children conclusion as was indicated earlier one of the major trends of the last two years and one that is responsible for most of the increases to be found in several of the categories earlier identified especially biography and informational books is toward publishers series the center for children books has in its collection titles from eighty such series exclusive of author and reprint series many of these publishers series came into being between  and  and all of them expanded during that period the series cover a wide range of subjects and types the more recent ones being primarily concerned with general information united states history and biographies not all publishers series are bad and not all the titles within any one series are bad but the general impression obtained from a wide reading of them is one of overwhelming mediocrity with few exceptions the books show the results of hasty writing and hasty editing some of the books have obviously been written by authors who have done no previous writing for children and who have made no attempt to learn the requirements of such writing before starting on their assigned task other books and these are in some ways even more distressing have been written by authors who are capable of doing good writing for children when given a free hand in choosing the subject and style of writing the overwhelming flood of merchandise that abounds in the children book field today gives the adult who is working with children books pause to wonder if there will ever again be a golden age to match that of the  children books are more beautiful today than they have ever been in the past and it is to be hoped that the content will soon again come up to the standard of the physical format and that there will once again be books that are beautiful to read as well as beautiful to see
