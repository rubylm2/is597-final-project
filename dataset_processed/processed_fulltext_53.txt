integrating research results and national board certification standards into a leadership curriculum for school library media specialists nancy everhart and eliza t dresang national guidelines and professional associations have recently focused on leadership as an essential action area for competent school library media specialists although for many years at the florida state university college of information leadership had been incorporated into the curriculum for school media specialists faculty prompted by a university wide leadership initiative and feedback from the field decided to examine possible ways to integrate an even stronger leadership component the national board for professional teaching standards tenets which focus on encouraging organizational leadership provided a natural foundation for curriculum development florida state university college of information faculty systematically developed a based on research leadership curriculum project lead using a variety of formal and informal data sources this research both validated and improved course content research findings substantively influenced the curriculum design that will produce school library media specialist leaders introduction the application of research to teaching and learning is a sound best practice in library and information science lis education factors mitigating against this practice might be the nheritance of course content textbook driven teaching reliance on professor preference and perceived expertise lack of time and other resources and tradition the development of a graduate leadership certificate largely based on the national board for professional teaching standards tenets at the florida state university college of information provided the opportunity to apply research consciously and systematically to the development of curriculum without encountering the potential barriers grant support for increasing institutional capacity from the institute of museum and library services project lead leaders educated to make a difference gave faculty the time and resources to develop a based on research curriculum the newness of the curriculum helped to free the process from time honored expectations ie from exj of education for library and information science vol  no   fall   issn    association for library and information science education

 journal of education for library and information science science foundations the major teachers unions and the us department of education national board certification was created in the wake of a carnegie foundation report on the dismal state of us education national board certification is achieved through a rigorous performance based assessment based on five core teaching propositions and ten subject based standards to qualify candidates must hold a state license have at least three years of certified experience pass a standardized ets developed subject area assessment and develop a four part portfolio that includes videotaped interactions with students and extensive documentation of organizational leadership portfolio entries in library media are comprised of appreciation of literature collaboration integration of technology and documented accomplishments many benefits exist for those who achieve national board certification the process itself is a type of leadership training at least thirty two states now accept the certification all fifty states and more than  school districts have implemented policies and regulations to recruit reward and retain national board certified educators for example florida pays  of the  certification fee and successful candidates receive a  salary increase for ten years a few states eg georgia reward only national board certified teachers in low income schools research questions the following research questions form a framework for the curriculum development discussed in this paper  how does systematic in depth research make a difference in course development  to what extent will it validate what faculty would have done without it and to what extent does it change what would have been done  is there a need for leadership courses based on national board tenets methods and procedures both informal and formal data sources inform the teaching and learning in the project lead curriculum a carefully planned needs assessment was organized to make use of these sources a basic assumption underlying our data collection and analysis is that improving performance on the national board certification process will enhance leadership performance with this assumption while we did consult more general research literature our data sources were chiefly published or unpublished print and electronic documents related to the national board or queries addressed to persons associated with the national board standards process and results documents existing research and statistics since there have been no research studies of national board certified li

 journal of education for library and information science national board certification process is achieved and the extent to which participants become local and national leaders recommendations one result of this study is to demonstrate the need for academic research on national board candidates in the field of library media the needs assessment survey and interviews carried out as part of project lead demonstrate that library media candidates have needs that differ to some extent from their classroom teacher peers more needs to be known about unsuccessful candidates and what might have helped them succeed in order to incorporate this knowledge into course content another recommendation is for other lis educators to examine their curriculum and perhaps to survey their students and alumni to ascertain the need for and interest in a curriculum such as that offered by florida state due to its online nature this curriculum is available anywhere that the internet exists however the curriculum content is also available for other lis schools to adopt if they have an appropriate clientele a final recommendation is for all lis educators to make a concerted effort to base curriculum development on published and self conducted research the findings from this study substantially influenced the development of courses and headed them in a direction that will most likely best achieve desired learning outcomes while meeting learner needs references   american association of school librarians and association for educational communications and technology information power chicago american library association   national board for professional teaching standards accomplished teachers taking on new leadership roles in schools  httpwwwnbptsorgresearcharchive_ cfmid accessed february    lloyd bond tracy smith wanda k baker and john a hattie the certification system of the national board for professional teaching standards a construct and consequential validity study greensboro nc center for educational research and evaluation   dan goldhaber and emily anthony can teacher quality be effectively assessed  urban institute april   httpwwwurbanorguploadedpdf _ nbptsoutcomespda accessed february    carnegie task force on teaching as a profession a nation prepared teachers for the  st century washington dc carnegie forum on education and the economy   national board for professional teaching standards state and local support and incentives  httpwwwnbptsorgaboutstatecfm accessed february    national board for professional teaching standards national board for professional teaching standards studies reports  papers january   httpwww nbptsorgpdfresearchnbpts_bibliographypdf accessed february    national board for professional teaching standards research department impact of nbpts certification on teachers who earned national board certification arlington
