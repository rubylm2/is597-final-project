  the library quarterly tral focus of the work conducted at the western and eastern colored branches in louisville and at the negro public library in nashville but little is known about the book collections available to african american children in the first decades of the twentieth century when public libraries in the south began serving black patrons within a system of racial segregation the children collections offered at segregated branch libraries are difficult to interpret and they raise a number of questions about the libraries roles the librarians intentions and the children use analysis of the books acquired by the public institution of the library can enrich our understanding of children services as a mechanism for shaping black readers kay vandergrift  pp   asserts that youthful readers craft their own meanings out of the texts they encounter as individuals first and as members of social and cultural groups later often with the mediation of a librarian stanley fish  pp   argues that a text can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the socially constructed context within which it is read a reader construes a text on the basis of the reader membership in an interpretive community of shared understandings yet libraries are much more than a place where librarians gather texts and readers interpret them as janice radway  p  has asserted if all of us could forget that most familiar of assumptions the assumption that everyone who uses a library does so to engage in the same activity that of reading then we might see that the library and its librarians in fact foster many different kinds of interactions with printed artifacts racially segregated public libraries were places that provided access to services as well as to collections and the services tended to influence children use of the libraries this article draws on original library records annual reports and librarians writings to begin to reconstruct the complex relationship between african american librarians and young library users it describes and evaluates the collections librarians developed for black children in louisville and nashville it also discusses the services that encouraged reading as a group activity and as an individual pursuit southern background louisville and nashville are significant as exceptions to the standard practice of denying southern blacks library services and collections in the early decades of the twentieth century  pp    pp    historians george wright  pp     and don doyle  pp   have described the race relations context in louisville and nashville respectively in louisville restrictions based on race began

books for black children  literature harris himself wrote in his introduction the story of the rabbit and the fox  is a fable thoroughly characteristic of the negro sic and it needs no scientific investigation to show why he selects as his hero the weakest and most harmless of all animals and brings him out victorious in contests with the bear the wolf and the fox it is not virtue that triumphs but helplessness it is not malice but mischievousness  p xiv this also suggests why children black and white enjoyed the stories alison lurie  p xii has noted that folklore and particularly the tales and legends of childhood can be subversive in a number of ways folklore can be used to express whatever is muted suppressed or compromised in mainstream culture  or it may suggest that people we usually despise and overlook have unsuspected powers clearly uncle remus stories of the rabbit outwitting the fox appealed to readers who found themselves among the despised and overlooked unlike the folklore recounted by harris the fiction created by thomas nelson page was unambiguous in its nostalgia for antebellum southern life and culture  pp     by the time nashville negro public library opened kercheval had ordered seven page titles among the camps or young people stories of the war a captured santa claus polly a christmas recollection santa claus  partner tommy trot visit to santa claus two little confederates and two prisoners although louisville blue and harris did not recommend any of them for first purchase the  edition of the children catalog listed all but polly settings during the civil war are featured in among the camps a captured santa claus and two little confederates while two prisoners features a war widow typical of page work is his characterization of african americans in two little confederates  a children novel originally published in  and based on page own recollections of being a child in virginia during the civil war page set the novel on a southern plantation and told the story of war from the perspective of two young brothers when the two brothers play at war they are the officers and their playmates the slave children are the rank and file when real union soldiers approach the boys mother informs the slaves that they may go with the yankees but that if they do she will never allow them to return the slaves assure her they have no intention of leaving  pp   page also uses dialect and misspellings to represent his black characters speech despite their themes and settings page books were popular outside the south for example christine pawley  p  found two little confederates to be among the titles preferred by boys using the osage iowa public library in the s harris and page are obvious choices for analysis because they wrote
  the library quarterly about the south and included black characters and tales in their works for children and adults but many of the authors represented in louisville and nashville collections included incidental black characters in their novels and stories as dorothy broderick  has documented these minor characters usually reflected negative stereotypes rather than realistic portrayals that moved the plot forward among the stereotypes broderick identified were aunt chloe who fears that the yankees will try to take her from her master in thomas aldrich the story of a bad boy  p  happy slave turned loyal servant mom beck in annie johnston the little colonel  p  the bad tempered and potentially violent black woman who fascinates the white protagonist of susan coolidge what katy did  p   and the black cook who screams when she sees that her young son hair has been bleached golden by two white boys in frances calhoun miss minerva and william green hill  p   in such books young african american readers chanced upon unflattering images of blacks in addition to folktales and fiction the children collections recommended by louisville and purchased in nashville included nonfiction works here too african american readers might discover references to black life and culture an example appears in frank carpenter  series of geographical readers intended to supplement classroom reading the  reader on north america included descriptive tours through the tobacco and cotton lands of the south in the section on virginia carpenter noted that the state had had many plantations worked by slaves most of whom remained in the south after emancipation he continued our colored people are as a rule good citizens hundreds of thousands of them now own their homes and farms many have learned trades or professions and a large number have engaged in businesses of various kinds nearly all of them send their children to school and not a few colored boys and girls are going to college  p  such a positive report glossed over the jim crow restrictions in place throughout the south and their impact on the availability and quality of schooling and the nature of the businesses and trades in which black citizens were engaged the use of the phrase our colored people revealed the writer condescension and the sense that his audience was white still carpenter offered a positive depiction of african american accomplishment denoting not former slaves who happily continued to occupy the plantations but a striving people who owned property and pursued education  native americans and chinese immigrants did not fare so well in carpenter descriptions after describing the brutal practices of savage indians carpenter reassures his readers that such behavior is a thing of the past because of the us government diligent work
books for black children  juvenile readers information about the children who used such books in library branches for african americans is elusive in the case of nashville however the original register of borrowers  is still in existence an analysis of the first  individuals to register covering the period from february  to april   reveals that  names had the code letter j assigned to them indicating they were juveniles judging from their first names about one third of these juveniles were male and two thirds were female  p  among the  children about whom it is possible to find further information thirty eight had fathers who were laborers a common working class occupation among african americans in southern cities at that time only ten men working as laborers themselves registered to use the library suggesting that the lack of leisure time interfered with adults ability to exploit the benefits of libraries among the poorest children probably were the twelve who depended on their mothers incomes as laundresses parents pursued a variety of occupations ranging from porter to janitor from barber to cook also registered were children of the black middle class including those whose parents owned their own businesses or who worked as administrators physicians and teachers among the adults who registered to use the library and whose occupations could be determined the largest category was that of teacher the principal and ten teachers from pearl high school registered as did principals and teachers from a dozen elementary schools for african american children in nashville  pp   in some cases the listing of a teacher name in the register is followed by listings of several juvenile borrowers indicating that teachers escorted their students to the library to introduce them to its wonders historian leon litwack  asserts that black schoolchildren were exposed to the same moralistic and patriotric textbooks that white children were and to the same sanitized history of anglo saxons and northern europeans  p  for nashville however black schoolchildren were exposed to few if any textbooks in his study of african american life in nashville bobby lovett  p  concluded that the public schools for black children were chronically underfunded and that they offered at most a few arithmetic and geography books to civilize the various tribes  pp   in his section on san francisco carpenter noted the presence of our neighbors from the other side of the pacific ocean because they only came to work and not to become citizens who would contribute to the country prosperity carpenter asserted the us government had decided it was best not to have too many of them and had implemented laws to keep them from entering the country  p 
 the library quarterly consequently public library collections were important because they could offer supplementary and alternative reading matter for both teachers and students to use libraries could include material that both supported and undermined the status quo depending on authorial intention and reader interpretation at the same time however librarians were limited in their choices by three factors first the positioning of the librarian as a kind of educator second the range of books available for acquisition and third a practice of collecting mainstream materials public librarians saw themselves as having a role in the education and socialization of young people according to harriet long  in her history of library work with children the leaders who developed children collections and services in public libraries during the final decade of the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth had five main goals to make good books available to all children of a community to train boys and girls to use the adult library with discrimination to reinforce and supplement the class work of the city schools to cooperate with institutions for civic and social betterment and first and last to build character and develop literary taste through the medium of books and the influence of the children librarian  pp   the goals of developing the child character and instilling a taste for good literature shaped the librarian ability to offer a wide variety of material in a book intended to guide parents in selecting proper reading material for their children librarian frances jenkins olcott  pp   wrote that bad books focused on adventure without any attention to the difference between good and evil vicious books valorized criminals and sensationalized love both categories of books stimulated children imaginations in directions that led away from morality and propriety olcott acknowledged that adults would have to intervene to lead children away from the highly popular bad and vicious literature to the books that may forcibly impress on character ideas of justice truth honor loyalty and heroism  p  librarians worried about supplying children with fiction especially the works of popular authors such as oliver optic and horatio alger but many of them did in part because they hoped that children would develop the habit of reading and eventually seek more uplifting literature their efforts to censor at the site of consumption were linked to their efforts to position themselves as professionals capable of judging the moral and aesthetic qualities of the books they considered for acquisition according to alison parker  p  but librarians found it difficult to agree on the definition of a bad book and on specific

 the library quarterly supportive services within the library branches for african americans librarians attempted to counter the negative attitudes found outside the library and in its stacks by creating a space for children to encounter literature on terms shaped by the black library staff children who used public libraries talked with librarians and each other about which books to read joined library sponsored discussion groups and debating societies and attended story hours and told stories themselves in children minds and hands books were not inert objects to be returned after their texts were consumed instead they were sites of imagination interaction and interpretation in louisville where the american library association held its annual meeting in  white children librarian bernice bell  pp  presented a paper outlining the work of the two branches for african americans the western colored branch conducted outreach to the city and county schools for black children the library provided circulating classroom collections selected by grade level circulation patterns revealed that african american children borrowed less fiction but more folklore than white children among black children fiction accounted for  percent of the total circulation compared to  percent in white classroom collections and folklore  percent compared to  percent in white schools in both cases nonfiction accounted for  percent of total circulation in  bell conducted a survey of reading interests among fourth and sixth graders she asked each child to write on a slip of paper the author and title of a favorite book she found that about  percent of the white students but under  percent of the black students responded with titles the library did not recommend of those white children enjoyed popular series such as the motor boys adventures written by howard garis using the pseudonym clarence young while black children indicated a preference for horatio alger books both kinds of responses registered disapproval on the part of bell but she noted that the staff of the western and eastern branches had told her it was not necessary to expend a lot of energy trying to steer black children away from mediocre and pernicious books because so few of them had access to books outside the library bell explained to the overwhelmingly white audience attending the american library association annual meeting in  that black children relative lack of familiarity with the mediocre books that  percent of the white children had indicated they liked was a result of poverty colored parents can buy few books she reported and trust without question the librarian judgment in the selection of juvenile books  p  the children lack of access to even cheap books
books for black children  of the sensational variety gave the librarians a larger measure of control at least over those children who used the library toward the ultimate goal of building character and developing literary taste librarians urged children to read nonfiction as well as stories rachel harris  p  noted that fiction accounted for only about  percent of the circulation at the western colored branch in its first five years of operation because african american children did not have the habit of reading she reported the librarians could guide them toward history biography and other nonfiction biographies satisfied the same kind of desire that the horatio alger books did harris wrote hat book that will tell them about a boy who though poor and otherwise handicapped struggled overcame and became famous appeals to them    there are few of our boys and girls who will not gladly take a copy of the life of abraham lincoln or booker t washington and read them over and over their parents often having them read the same to them also the self made element in the lives of these men strikes a responsive chord in the hearts of our young people  p  the librarians guided children reading by recommending specific books they further guided children reading by organizing book clubs that met in the library for example the boys reading club met weekly at the western colored branch at the beginning of each meeting the roll was called and the club required that each respondent provide a summary of the book he had read that week when a club member gave an especially enthusiastic synopsis the others would ask for a longer description the club proved so popular that the library established one for girls and then one for freshmen and sophomores in high school and another for juniors and seniors membership encouraged youngsters to read beyond the texts assigned for their schoolwork  p  librarians in louisville and nashville also instigated story hours an innovation that allowed them to highlight the literature of their choice by reading it aloud to audiences of impressionable youngsters librarians used story hours to promote the fiction and nonfiction they thought capable of stimulating the children intellectual growth and their character development  p   the story hour became one of the most popular library services offered at the western colored branch  to  children attended weekly  p  the story hour had an impact on the individual child who might hear a story and then borrow the book the story came from but storytelling also had an impact on the interpretive community of black children the story hour was a group activity that conveyed multiple meanings story hours had become standard offerings for youthful clients in
 the library quarterly public libraries all over the country with the advent of children collections and services in the decades surrounding the turn of the twentieth century yet they carried special value for black children as harris white counterpart at the louisville free public library noted special entertainments story hours and clubs mean far more in the life of the colored child than in the life of the average white child he owns few toys or books in fact recreation in any form is almost unknown to the large majority  p  conclusion black librarians who worked at the branches in louisville and nashville used oral storytelling to engage youngsters in the literate life harris did not invent the library story hour but she recognized its value the majority of our children have never had stories told to them their parents being compelled to work out from home all day and during the evening they have not the time though they may have the stories to tell and the little ones have been deprived of every child birthright  a generous supply of good stories  p  harris  told attendees at the national association of teachers in colored schools in  that the library had instigated the story hours to inform children of the contents of the collections and to pique their interest and encourage them to read the books themselves after the story hour focused on tiny tim or oliver twist for instance books by dickens circulated but the staff soon discovered that the story hours served other purposes as well the librarians went beyond storybooks and told tales of english history with the result that the library english history books for children were in high demand she noted that children derived both enjoyment and education from the stories they heard and the stories they read carefully chosen stories could build character instilling values and virtues such as obedience courage honesty and loyalty furthermore story hours helped children develop their ability to concentrate and put them in a happy frame of mind that made learning possible and when children participated by telling stories themselves they increased their vocabulary and honed their verbal expression in louisville joseph s cotter principal of the s coleridge taylor colored public school and a published author had suggested that the library hold a children storytelling contest at the end of the school year the storytelling contests began in  cotter and others donated money for prizes for the children who accurately repeated a tale they had heard at one of the library story hours held during the
books for black children  school year cotter also had the winners names engraved on a loving cup on display in the library to enter a child had to be a registered borrower in good standing at the library and a student who attended school regularly the contest rules also required participants to have attended library story hours regularly and to tell a story that had been featured during the past year the storytelling contest was well received and both the western and eastern colored branches made it an annual event  p  among the pieces the participants had heard at the library and retold at the contest were fairytales such as matsuyama mirror and golden heart folklore explaining how fear came and why the sea is salty and classics such as john ruskin the king of the golden river and nathaniel hawthorne the great stone face they also told tales from greek and roman mythology  in  as the judges mulled their decision regarding the winners cotter told an uncle remus tale for the crowd gathered in the western colored branch assembly hall  in  a student chose to retell the story of little black sambo   although the extant sources documenting such activities do not reveal the manner in which these tales were presented or received it is possible to speculate that the context had an impact on the performance a tale of brer rabbit told by a respected african american educator and writer to a group of african american children presented a different experience than a tale of brer rabbit framed by joel chandler harris characterization of a contented uncle remus similarly a black librarian or student telling of little black sambo courage and cleverness created an event emotionally and materially unlike a private reading of the book with its insulting illustrations the surrounding supportive environment may have lessened the potentially devastating impact of the worst stereotypes at least on the children who frequented a library reserved for african americans black librarians working in separate libraries had dual contradictory roles they worked in buildings intended to keep black children out of white libraries and they built collections that reflected the racism children encountered in their everyday lives librarians working at racially segregated branches in louisville and nashville acquired collections similar to those acquired by libraries serving whites in so doing they introduced some racist stereotypes and images into the collections at the same time they acted on their faith in education and racial uplift by encouraging african american children to read they created an environment in which children could engage in reading as a social activity involving listening telling recommending and interpreting they created a space that encouraged and supported black children desire to participate in the life of the mind the extent and
