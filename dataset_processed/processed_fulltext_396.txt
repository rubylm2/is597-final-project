introduction how might information literacy il be animated by new approaches to literacy theory to make concerns about equity its point of origin and the production of equity its central function what begins as a broad question of the theoretical underpinnings of finding evaluating and using information intensifies when placed at the junction of community college students and higher education since this intersection is harrowing indeedas fraught with obstacles to accessing further higher education as are paths to accessing information a more traditional librarian concern with technological political and economic barriers students in community colleges need libraries in which the theory undergirding information finding evaluating and using addresses what jenny cookgumperz has called the central problem of distribution of opportunity  p  given the abysmal rate of community college students transferring to fouryear institutions a flawed but useful measure of equity   nothing less than this radical endeavor seems worthy of attention to be more precise although the specifics of information literacy il are of vital importance without a framework concerned with improving equity the specifics do not seem consequential enough to realize any sort of substantial result in other words community college instructional librarians spend a great deal of time analyzing how to teach the use of a catalog how to maneuver through a database or how to find credible web sites  these inquiries while essential for all students might lead to more equity for community college students by widening the scope of il for example the specifics of an information interactiona young latina and a community college librarian using a database to find an article on césar chávez for a reading classcan be understood most completely by asking the following what theoretical inquiries must we undertake to see what is going on here and in what ways does a librarians theory of il enable or disable this young womens ability to get information on chávez retrieve it get this information understand and evaluate it and get from use her finding and evaluating of it something that will get her capital

summary the questions that urgently need answering concerning the role of community college libraries in what students do and dont do know and dont know and feel and dont feel about information might yield more fruitful answers if they issue from a focus on equity and a resistance to inequity in this article i first identify conceptual advances in literacy theory that have contributed to vitalized theories of il theories that might lead to more equitable educational outcomes for community college students following this the concept of equity specifically as it applies to community college students will be discussed i then describe jeanluc nancys framework of globalisation and mondialisation  and apply it to moments in ancient librarianship history with the hope that librarians who are critically aware of their vocations history will be better positioned to think expansively about il in order to better understand how community college students equity might be furthered i intersperse among these historical examples some reconceptualizations of il that have the potential to contribute to the production of equity particularly for community college students information literacy conceptual advances in literacy and equity information literacy a topic of immense consequence over the past decade in academic libraries has been discussed defined and debated by lis scholars in over  articles since the term was coined in   why has il gained such momentum as librarians have become more and more interested in instruction over the past thirty years their interest in il has grown  understood as a product of the confluence of change in technology in the ways in which college students interact with information in societys perception of the nature of knowledge and in the way librarians view their role in higher education definitions of il tend to include three elements resourcebased learning critical thinking and lifelong learning  p  taking into account that one of the main reasons for ils rise to prominence is that librarianship has felt a strong need to proclaim its relevance it is not surprising that in the literature of librarianship il has often run the risk of being understood as a silver bullet as a monolithic and generic set of skills that transforms students  at times it seems to promise too muchto be the key to lifelong learning the antidote to humanitys all too human record of hoodwinking itself politically and economically and the conduit for social justice  yet many applications of il seem quite limited community college librarians spend vast amounts of their instructional time devoted to the mechanical aspects of il teaching students how for example to cite their sources in correct mla apa or chicago style but if information literacy as it is currently understood is lacking in a number of ways both theoretically and practically then how might community college librarians refocus their attention toward addressing issues of equity for their students how might community college librarians who frequently claim interest in producing more equitable results for their students theorize il more effectively to better understand how new theoretical perspectives on literacy might link il to equity in community college libraries a precise description is needed of what these perspectives entail as well as what is meant by equity brian street has identified several contested complex and interrelated approaches to literacy that have emerged since the s in response to an earlier less fruitful understanding of literacy  this older view was a reified autonomous notion of literacy which had a big l and a little y  p  novel perspectives on literacy that have led lis researchers to think anew about il include  emphasis on explicit instruction of how specific discourses are constructed  critical literacy which foregrounds social change cultural diversity economic equity and political enfranchisement  p   a sociocultural understanding of meaning as socially created  student engagement in the research process early in the semester  new conceptualizations of the nature of reading  an approach to il as a practice rather than as a set of skills  foregrounding of the role of power in thinking about literacy  a broadening of il to encompass insights from workplace information literacy what do these approaches have in common when applied to il these conceptual advances in literacy seek to produce directly or indirectly and with varying degrees of explicitness an understanding of literacy that is more and more equity centric these equitycentric perspectives on literacy have been employed by researchers of il in invigorating ways that will be explored throughout this article although all college students profit from il that is infused with characteristics of these new ways of conceptualizing literacy community college students who are on average least likely to succeed in higher education  especially need il that is vitalizing and that leads toward equity but what is meant by equity the first step in linking such a view of il and equity is to delineate which area of equity with its vast theoretical economic and political implications instructional librarians in community college are positioned to address in defining equity specifically in the context of community college students it is important to differentiate between on the one hand educational equity as it is framed in community college research and on the other hand librarianships long history of research on information equity which has examined such topics as the information rich and the information poor the knowledge gap and the digital divide this article will focus on educational equity for community college students which is often measured by looking at the extent to which students persist in enrolling semester after semester transfer rates of community college students to fouryear institutions and degree or program completion rates these dependent variables are usually analyzed in terms of such independent variables as advising remediation social and academic integration transfer support and financial aid  one promising line of research on educational equity in community colleges has contrasted equity with the related concepts of diversity and inclusion  in this approach equity is gauged by comparing the outcomes of a target group students in community colleges desiring a baccalaureate for example to an appropriate reference population such as all students who obtain a bachelors degree  this framework then shifts the emphasis from individual students as the unit of analysis and instead asks what role the community college faculty staff administrators and institutional structure play in creating inequitable outcomes this shift in focus is also evident in the research of jim cummins who offers a theoretical framework stressing educators personal redefinitions as one antidote to the repeated failure of educational reform for minority k students  many of whom eventually attend community college he asserts that truly equitable educational reform requires personal redefinitions of the way classroom teachers interact with their students and surrounding communities  p  while insisting that political approaches to equity are necessary cummins insists that implementation of change is dependent upon the extent to which educators both collectively and individually redefine their roles with respect to minority students and communities  p  as minority students are much more likely to enter higher education through community college than by going directly to fouryear institutions   any attempt to further equitable outcomes in higher education for them must carefully examine the affordances and obstacles that community college libraries offer in the educational pipeline but equity in community college libraries is not simply about improving educational outcomes for students of color community college students as a group are more likely than other students in higher education to be from all other historically underserved segments of the populationthe first generation in their family to attend college lowincome students english language learners newcomers to the united states and students with physical and cognitive disabilities   michal kurlaender describes community colleges as important vehicles for moderating inequalities in educational attainment because they offer noncompetitive access to higher education to socially financially and academically disadvantaged students who otherwise would not be able to enroll in college  p  discussions of educational equity by community college researchers have never explored the role of the library similarly a thorough search of lis literature on educational equity and community college il instruction retrieved no results the goal of this article is to begin to bridge this gap by identifying ways in which il infused by conceptual advances in literacy while important for all students is crucial for furthering community college students educational opportunitiesin other words for opening up channels for community college students equity all librarians profit from considering the transformative aspects of their work but community college librarians in particular who tend to serve historically underserved students might consider new ways of thinking about il that contribute to more equitable educational outcomes for their students naive assumptions that a reimagined theorizing of il is somehow sufficient to produce educational equity for community college students are less than helpfulapproaches to lessening educational inequity that overlook political and economic factors at macro levels could result in less equitable outcomes for example misplaced hope that equity is achieved simply by reenvisioning community college students as producers rather than as consumers of information could potentially hinder students equity by distracting attention from community college libraries chronic issues of understaffing and underfunding however while acknowledging that complex interrelated and stubborn social political and economic factors most of which are beyond the control of librarians contribute to inequitable educational outcomes for community college students librarians can exploit their limited but potentially pivotal role in furthering their students equity by reconceptualizing il linking educational equity for community college students to il theory requires a study of power at its extremities where it becomes capillary  p  where power  becomes capillary is a fitting description of a community college library in which the decisions of those holding economic and political power are transformed into resources and policies for students whose families have generally been on the short end of the bibliographic stick for generations likewise here at this capillary level is where librarians are positioned to transform new theories about literacy into il that creates equity institutional capillaries are ideal for studying these transformations of power into policy and theory into equity but how are we to understand either of these processes when they both are so microscopic and diffuse a useful starting point involves placing il in historical context christine pawley encourages such a historical analysis of il asserting that even an innovative professional practice carries with it the marks of its inheritanceits genetic imprintalthough the implication of these characteristics may be poorly recognized  p  examining early moments in librarianship at a capillary scaleconsidering ancient libraries catalogs for examplemay help to explain how students education equity is hindered in community college libraries such a historically expansive examination at such a minute level requires a powerful conceptual framework   for an overview of the impact of critical literacy theory on information literacy including discussion of paolo freire see james elmborg  heidi jacobs  also offers helpful suggestions for using freireian approaches to thinking about theory undergirding information literacy   the very long history of research on equity in librarianship has tended to focus on information equity which leah lievrouw and sharon farb define as the fair or reasonable distribution of information among individuals groups regions categories or other social units such that those people have the opportunity to achieve whatever is important or meaningful to them in their lives  p  readers wishing to gain an understanding of this line of research will find their review very useful  research done before the s is more thoroughly reviewed by ronald doctor  jeanluc nancys globalisation and mondialisation and the catalog of nippur jeanluc nancy in describing two contrasting directions in which history might be currently unfoldingglobalisation globalization which he sees as the death of the worldand mondialisation world forming which involves the creation of the world  p  offers an enormously generative theoretical framework within which to consider the tension inherent in il between the librarians aspiration to aid in finding evaluating and using information mondialisation and the librarians desire to suppress this impulse by declaring certain knowledge as offlimits globalisation a radical theorizing of il requires contextualizing it in this dynamic tension between library as an aid to accessing information mondialisation and library as a barrier to access globalisation catalogs and indexes the same tools for using the library for gaining access for facilitating circulation of materials for the consumption of information are also the marks of certification and of authority literally the list of holdings jacques derrida explains this authority through etymology  in tracing archive to arkheion a house in which superior magistrates archons both guarded and interpreted official documents derrida sees the archive as a place of patriarchal guardianship and hermeneutic authority  p  according to nancys framework globalisation results in a homogenized and unjust world where hermeneutic authority is oppressive and totala world in which librarians see their role primarily as guarding and vetting information mondialisation on the other hand would require librarians to redefine their primary task as contributing to the creation of an equitable world by conceptualizing information as something that is created and to undertake this personal redefinition with a sense of urgency to create the world means immediately without delay reopening each possible struggle for a world that is for what must form the contrary of a global injustice against the background of general equivalence  p  just as jacques derridas linguistic excavation of the word archive reopens our understanding of hermeneutic authority so might an attempt to link nancys framework to archeologists physical excavations of ancient libraries open possible ways of conceptualizing il excavation of the earliest known library near nippur in southern mesopotamia unearthed what might be thought of as ils founding text a rudimentary catalog consisting of two tablets dating to around  bc both inscribed with a list of sumerian works of literaturevarious myths hymns laments  p  how does this catalog etched in clay offer us insights into the ways freshman and sophomore college students interact with information the catalog of nippur offers at least two understandings simultaneously first it is evidence that at the moment that collections grew too large for easy access through browsing a retrieval toolan aid to accesswas invented even if the tool was a simple list it is in the jargon of librarianship the first known finding aid and aids for finding are indirectly aids for using for creating for participating in the discourse ultimately for the furtherance of democratic processes for mondialisation second the catalog signifies hindrance the librarys authority priestly authority and to the extent that it is interpreted as objectified total and unified knowledge a tool of globalisation the catalog is an inventory of the librarys holdings thereby a description of the sanctioned knowledgeliterally sanctioned if one considers that many of the ancient libraries were physically connected to sanctuaries  as both an aid for using and for the production of knowledge on the one hand and on the other hand as an aid for keeping for keeping order in library terms bibliographic control and for demarcating certified knowledge the tablets of nippur indicate librarianships central contradictions sharing and holding aiding and hindering furthering research and by designating certain information as privileged obstructing it information literacy has conventionally been theorized to explain catalogs indexes tables of contents and database search boxes the descendants of the nippur catalog as aids for finding and using information but how would theory about il change and how would community college students educational equity be furthered if the tablets were acknowledged by librariansand explicitly presented to studentsalso as tools for keeping keeping from keeping separate keeping safe keeping the status quo rather than trying to overcome this tension pawley wisely describes the tension as being between conflicting ideals of on the one hand a promethean vision of citizen empowerment and democracy and on the other a desire to control quality of information that has the potential to result inalbeit unintendedprocrustean consequences  p  advocating understanding it and laying it open for inspection and discussion pawley also embraces this tension as creative and helpful and asserts that we can achieve and maintain a balance between constraint and liberality that will promote the most emancipatingprometheaninstitutional and professional practices of il  pp  how might this tension apparently as old as libraries themselves be further theorized nancys philosophy needs further exploration it is important to emphasize that an application of nancys mondialisation to il would not result in a kind of riotous information freeforall a resolution of the dissonance inherent in librarianship between encouraging discovery and encouraging discernment rather following pawleys advocacy for an acceptance of the tension as fruitful mondialisation would be operationalized as theory supporting il that fosters careful yet adventurous sense making at first this stance may seem excessively and unproductively conservative it is tempting to align mondialisation with absolutely free information interaction however just as i associate nancys globalisation with unjust discrimination and not with astute discernment i also align mondialisation with judicious freedom in research avoiding the theorizing of il that would teach students to see information as undifferentiated unpacking nancys densely constructed argument will help to explain why an acceptance of librarianships ancient contradiction is congruent with both nancys philosophy and with equitycentered il theory central to both the misery caused by globalisation and the justice produced by mondialisation are contrasting understandings of meaning nancys globalisation is associated with a globe in space with totality as a whole  p  and with an unjust global network of agglomerationunrelenting conglomeration mixed with accumulation resulting in wealth for a few and misery for more and more  p  as such globalisation does not allow for meaning making it is an earth without a sky  p  that is an objectified orb without a horizon that would provide a reference point for meaning making such a globe leads to progressive enclosure in the undifferentiated sphere of a unitotality  p  similar to michel de certeaus depiction of an existence in which the reader is a sheep progressively immobilized and handled  p  such a confinement and reduction which de certeau declares unacceptable  pp  results in what nancy calls an unworld  p  in contrast mondialisation involves a world such as debussys world or the hospital world  p  as opposed to globalisations objective totality as a whole mondialisation is a totality of meaning that involves a value system constituted of knowledge affectivity and participation  p  sharing an important component of nancys philosophy is how one participates in such a world for nancy sharing in a worlds value system or meaningful content means apprehending its codes and texts precisely when their reference points signs codes and texts are neither explicit nor exposed as such  p  who better to facilitate sharing who better to explicate and expose codes and texts than librarians the vocational descendants of the priestly cataloger of nippur who acquired classified and sanctified the very first collection this is a crucial point in developing a philosophical basis for an il theory that emanates from a concern for equity while honoring the ancient role of the librarian as keeper no longer wishing to wear the mantle of arbiter but hesitant to throw away such a long venerated cloth the librarian committed to equity shares the mantle by turning it inside out explicitly encouraging students to inspect the seams to examine critically the ways in which information is constructed   pawley explains her intriguing two mythological allusions which resonate powerfully with mondialisation and globalisation in a helpful footnote in the greek myth prometheus son of a titan takes pity on humans and gives them fire he thus empowers them to improve their lives by stimulating their creativity and enabling the development of the arts and sciences procrustes on the other hand is a robber who waylays travelers and forces them to lie on a terrible iron bed if they are too short to fit the bed exactly he stretches his victims if they are too long he chops off their legs either way death is the result  p  explicit and critical information literacy for creating information this shift in the role of librarian toward facilitating an explicit and critical examination of information is of particular importance in community colleges often the first generation in their families to attend higher education and frequently coming from poorly funded k schools in which they have been underprepared for higher education community college students especially would profit from librarians who see in themselves some of the metaphors suggested by allan luke and cushla kapitzke critical commentators mediators  mentors  nomadic intellectuals and cultural tourists  p  mentored to think about information critically such students would be more likely to interact with information in strategic ways than if they received instruction from librarians who viewed themselves as bibliographic custodians librarians who view their job as monitors of information and who prize the conventional lis framework of efficiency and effectiveness are probably the least likely mentors for promoting the idea that knowledge is constructed an idea that is both crucial to nancys thoroughly constructivist concept of mondialisation and essential to the intellectual development of all college students because students often arrive at a community college underprepared they are both especially disinclined to see themselves as capable of constructing knowledge and especially prone to see knowledge as existing as a thinginitself independent of mediation and interpretation  p  community college librarians need to offer underprepared students il embued with expectations that research is about what radford calls the individuals attempt to locate his knowledge claims within an existing order of knowledge claims  p  such an approach to ilan approach that authorizes students to create meaning to construct an argument to stake claims and to question others claimsis often full of inefficiency doubts intellectual circling and confusion it is surely more efficient for both librarian and student to see knowledge as something that can be tracked down and captured as luke and kapitzke have described  p  but it is a kind of efficiency that community college librarians especially need to reject literacy theorists glynda hull and mike rose long ago pointed out the debilitating effects of overrating efficiency when facilitating underprepared college students advancement toward collegelevel english courses  they offer a reminder that is especially pertinent to community college librarians hesitance and uncertaintyas we all know from our own intellectual strugglesare central to knowledgemaking  p  as important as it is for librarians to reconsider the value they place on efficiency it is equally important to rethink the chronological configuration of the research process and to reimagine the nature of reading as an act of discovery and creation early engagement of students in the research process and regarding students as creators of knowledge from the moment that they begin research are two characteristics of a reconceptualized il especially appropriate for community college libraries creation is conventionally conceived as happening only during the third act the using act of a threeact information literacy drama which involves a first act of finding and a second act of evaluating de certeau  complicates this magnificently de certeau asserts that even in the act of reading the middle act of evaluation students are foreshadowing the third act of using producing gardens that miniaturize and collate a world  p  not when quoting not when paraphrasing not when synthesizing during the writing phase but in the very act of reading according to de certeau the reader hearkens back to the first finding act like robinson crusoe discovering an island  p  and simultaneously prefigures the third using act by producing gardens constituting a secret scene  p  de certeaus potent vision of the reader is especially useful for community college librarians who work with students having in many cases limited facility in reading to pretend that de certeaus reenvisioning of the nature of reading could somehow erase the fact that a significant number of community college students lack basic reading skills is fruitless however de certeau offers librarians an alternative image of readinga vantage that emphasizes readers capacities rather than their shortcomings information literacy founded on de certeaus conceptualization of reading and on nancys sense of urgencyimmediately without delaywould attempt to engage community college students as early as possible in meaning making a community college library in which all phases of research were regarded as creative acts could contribute to equity when distributed throughout the research process the act of creating might lead students to see their roles as creators librarians interpreting their jobs as mentors of creators and il pedagogy that would be more like a glassblowing class combining technique aesthetics risk demonstration and practice and less like a workshop on microsoft excel these effects would tend to increase academic and social integration important components of college success for all students  but of crucial importance to students in community colleges because of the central role such integration plays in learning persistence and ultimately in their transfer to fouryear institutions many community college students drop out early in the semester before they have established a sense of belonging to the college hull and rose argue that the real stuff of belonging to an academic community is dynamic involvement in generating and questioning knowledge  p  community college librarians who base their il theory on nancys urgency to create early in the students experience and on de certeaus view of reading itself as an act of creation might contribute to improving students retention rates by structuring their pedagogy in ways that bind students to the college early in the term how could a community college library support students in viewing information critically and seeing themselves as authorities capable of creating knowledge how could librarians in community colleges translate into practice what pawley describes as envisioning information use as a process that involves all users in both consumption and production  p  mining the pedagogical ore of these questions michelle holschuh simmons advocates creating alliances among student disciplinespecific instructor and librarian with the librarian acting as a discipline discourse mediator who makes explicit the tacit ways in which information in a particular discipline is constructed  p  she celebrates historical instances of disciplinespecific work in librarianship including the work done in the midtwentieth century by specialist librarians who created extensive bibliographies in their particular area of expertise this work of creating bibliographies although among the most traditional tasks of the librarian could exemplify the best practices of a theorizing of il that is truly equity centric if students were apprenticed in compiling bibliographies with discernment if they were encouraged to seek information in all kinds of formats if they were taught to annotate them critically if they were through publishing the bibliographies online afforded opportunities to give and receive commentary on their choices and annotations and if the bibliographies were regarded as valuable works of creation useful for the whole local community of scholars then these bibliographies could truly contribute to an il pedagogy radiating from equity this approach might contribute to more equitable educational outcomes for community college students by moving students toward a role of authority and by moving librarians away from the idea that il is a set of skills creating an annotated bibliography that critically examines how specific disciplines discourses are constructed is a complex processcalling for exactly the kinds of qualities diane zabel recommends in excellent il instruction integrated relevant ongoing collaborative and applied  p  community college students some of whom have spent years in skillsoriented classrooms only to test into more skill building in basic reading writing and math courses on arrival at college are especially in need of meaningful integrated educational endeavors and of il that involves to use annemaree lloyds terms from her study of workplace information literacy a simultaneous and interrelated process which enacts the individual into the discourse of the context  p  contributions toward educational equity might be possible in any academic library where librarians see their job as creating pedagogy for students in the discourses of for example english history biology and political science community college librarians would especially profit from thinking in terms of il for disciplinespecific discourses since their libraries serve both transfer students and vocational education students in such disciplines as radiological technology fashion design and nursing next returning to an examination of examples from ancient libraries will show that community college librarians need to conceptualize il in ways that call into question issues of authority and that make explicit the tension in librarianship between aiding and hindering access to information the hattusas catalog hostile encounters and disqualified knowledge the long tradition of privileging librarians as experts and information from libraries as reliable a tradition to this day apparent at every level of education can be seen in another ancient catalog found in a library in the hittite capital of hattusas south of presentday ankara  more elaborate than the two tablets found at nippur the hattusas catalog includes helpful bibliographic details any priest who needed a ritual for a given problem instead of picking up tablet after tablet  had only to run eye over the entries in the catalogues it was a limited tool the order of the entries is more or less haphazard alphabetization for example lay over a millennium and a half in the future and they give no indication of location  p  the catalog may have been as lionel casson calls it a limited tool with limited possibilities for enlarging the ability of a limited subset of the populationprieststo gain access to the discourse at hand performing rituals but it is nonetheless an early example of how the practices involving il are situated within tension this tension springs from the ability of the il apparatus both explicitly to connect priest with ritual and its ability implicitly to identify accepted rituals acquired by authorized experts like modernday library catalogs which save students the time and trouble of searching through endless texts to find an academic ritual for an academic given problem the hattusas catalog should be understood without question as being very helpful for finding and using information however the unspoken effect of the catalog that of privileging information within it whether for a hittite priest or a community college student must be acknowledged as well all too often students first visit as undergraduates to an academic library includes messages about the superiority of peerreviewed articles a certain disdain on the part of their professors for encyclopedias the extremely dubious quality of the free internet as opposed to the proprietary databases to which the library subscribes and the absolute unworthiness of wikipedia even with some professors as a starting point the message given to college students must be similar to that given to the priests of nippur and hattusashere are kept the rituals here etched into these tablets are the sources of information that you can trust michel foucault seems to name this conflict between librarian and user when he speaks of the memory of hostile encounters which even up to this day have been confined to the margins of knowledge  p  it is easy to observe these hostile encounters in warnings found on clay tablets from the palace of ashurbanipal in nineveh your lordship is without equal ashur king of the gods whoever removes this tablet writes his name in place of my name may ashur and ninlil angered and grim cast him down erase his name his seed in the land  p  we recognize presentday manifestations of these hostile memories among these are the obvious instantiations access denied messages for students lacking the proper password for certain databases denial of privileges for students who either do not belong to a librarys mother learning institution or have fines or other blocks on their borrowing privileges myspace and other disqualified knowledges filtered out by some campuses and the simple but dramatic inequity of internet access however the memory of hostile encounters central to this articles thesis embedded in the discourse of il potently pervasively and yet almost invisibly constitutes a major element in librarianships habitus certain pieces of information are authorized certain texts are declared the property of the king of the gods thereby excluding the rest foucaults questions directed to the very heart of il theory of scholarly discourse and of librarianship ask what types of knowledge do you want to disqualify in the very instant of your demand is it a science which speaking discoursing subjectswhich subjects of experience and knowledgedo you then want to diminish when you say i who conduct this discourse am conducting a scientific discourse and i am a scientist  p  this disqualification of certain kinds of information while detrimental to all college students is particularly debilitating to community college students who frequently arrive at college underprepared to engage in scholarly discourse but who often have had all sorts of other powerful information literacy experiencesas immigrants persistently negotiating a maze of community resources as consumers shrewdly maneuvering through complex networks to procure affordable services and goods as employees tenaciously seeking work and evaluating conflicting sources of information to get ahead economically and as individuals whose critical consciousness as members of oppressed groups is finely honed and who may not be predisposed to display the competence they possess  p  such students success in community college depends partly on learning about il in ways that respect the rich knowledge they bring with them from these experiences paralleling the interest among literacy theorists in literacy beyond the walls of the school  il outside of the educational context has been identified by lloyd who studied il among firefighters as a way to trouble the waters of il discourse and vitalize its theoretical possibilities  lloyd argues for expanding our notions of information literacy by examining workplace information literacy which allows other voices and other ways of knowing to be heard and represented  p  while beneficial for all students lloyds argument is especially important when conceptualizing il for community college students many of whom work long hours to support themselves and in some cases their families including workforce information literacy in thinking about il also foregrounds the interplay of information with other nonacademic pursuits what lloyd calls the multiple realities of everyday life  p  multiple realities are precisely what many community college students experience deeply engaged in work family and social activities community college students are less likely than students at fouryear institutions to identity primarily as college students these multiple realities and identities make community college libraries an especially appropriate space for an expansive conceptualization of il toward an equitycentric information literacy this article has attempted to show that for several reasons community college libraries are ideal places from which to translate advanced concepts about literacy into equitycentric il first approaches to literacy that make explicit the ways in which specific disciplines discourses are constructed have led il researchers to conceive of librarians as discipline discourse mediatorsinsideroutsider librarians who can improve students chances of educational success by teaching them how communication in their particular discipline is carried out  p  community college students many of whom belong to family or social networks in which such explication is rare and whose previous education has not prepared them to analyze the specifics of discourses would especially profit from librarians who reveal the rhetorical patterns of specific disciplines in constructing information next critical literacy theorists with their explicit emphasis on addressing issues involving inequity have influenced the foregrounding of epistemological issues in il such as the inherently political nature of information critical il is of special importance to community college students many of whom have the most to gain from penetrating interpretations of information given their generally marginalized political and economical status third theories that use a sociocultural framework to view literacy as a practice rather than as a set of skills have aided lis researchers in conceiving of il as a fundamentally complex and creative enterprise this widening of ils theoretical scope contributes to students educational equity by asserting their capacity as authorities and as creators of information fourth studies of power and of its implications in the workings of literacy offer community college librarians ways to examine critically their own il instruction this critical stance might help librarians to consider how their pedagogy leads to them to disqualify subtly but potently certain kinds of knowledgethe very kinds of knowledge possessed by the students whose equity they are trying to further and finally just as literacy researchers whose studies of literacy practices outside of school have resulted in more nuanced understandings of both the nature of literacy and of how to honor literacy resources that students bring to school lis researchers have used workplace information literacy to expand notions of il in academic settings these more expansive ways of viewing il could be translated into better educational outcomes in any academic library but in a library serving community college students whose identities are generally more closely tied to work than students in fouryear institutions such broad theorizing of il is especially necessary for contributing to educational equity all librarians might profit from considering how educational equity could be furthered by thinking about their vocation as lodged within an ancient tension between furthering access to information mondialisation and blocking access to it globalisation but such contemplation is especially pertinent for community college librarians whose students are in general the most vulnerable in terms of the ill effects of undertheorized il to the extent that a community college students relationship to knowledge shifts from passive recipient whose task is to find evaluate and use knowledge to active producer of knowledge whose enterprise is to create meaning equity will tend to be produced when students view themselves as agentsas creators of informationno longer do they see their papers as compilations of pieces of truth retrieved evaluated and used but rather as created works written with the authority that flows from understanding informations political social and economic dimensions this also might lead toward educational equity because such a project if students enthusiastically participated in it might produce the crucial effects of academic and social integration into the culture of the community college what is at stake in how community college librarians theorize il perhaps the question should be posed to the many students who enter community college with the goal of eventually earning a baccalaureate degree according to statistical analysis by mariana alfonso by enrolling at a community college instead of at a year institution students see their probability of attaining a bachelors degree reduced by a range between  and  percent  p  if librarians meditate on this vision of injustice then it becomes apparent that nothing less than equity is at stake when we consider il theory such an urgent stance toward il is endorsed by derridas attempt to connect archives justice and hope in the future  p  i have  tried to situate justice  in the direction of the act of memory of resistance to forgetting  p  nancy argues that the only task of justice is thus to create a world tirelessly the space of an unappeasable and always unsettled sovereignty of meaning  p  perhaps community college libraries are particularly appropriate places to translate nancys framework into practices that would contribute to more equitable outcomes for community college students this possibility would be difficult to measure for a number of reasons including the need for precise ways to gauge educational equity the difficulties researchers generally encounter in tracking community college students after they graduate or transfer and the many confounding variables that might obscure the effects of an approach to il that claims to be equity centric these issues might provide avenues for further research   alfonsos analysis controlled for a number of important factors including lower socioeconomic status academic preparation and educational expectations of community college students  p
