in  educator nancy larrick brought national attention to the need for multicultural literature with her landmark article the all white world of childrens books larrick  the impetus for that article was as follows one day when larrick was visiting a preschool in new york city a five year old african american girl who was looking at a picture book asked her why are they always white larrick   larricks subsequent examination of the  childrens books published between  and  revealed that this young girls perceptions were rightthe characters in childrens books were almost always white only  percent of the books larrick examined included one or more black characters and less than  percent featured contemporary african americans most of the books were either historical fiction or were set outside the united states larrick identified two consequences of the omission of african americans from books for children first across the country  million nonwhite children were learning to read and to understand the american way of life in books that either omitted them entirely or scarcely mentioned them at all  second  million white children were learning from their books that they were the kingfish  larrick concluded there seems to be little chance of developing the humility so urgently needed for world cooperation  as long as children are brought up on gentle doses of racism through their books  larricks study combined with the growing awareness of diversity issues spawned by the civil rights movement led to the beginning of the multicultural publishing movement in youth literature the need for multicultural literature is even greater today than it was in  according to an analysis of the  us census data completed by the annie e casey foundation there are currently  million children under the age of eighteen in the united states  percent of them are children of color and indigenous children ohare  all of the growth in the child population since  has been among groups other than non hispanic whites three major groups experienced significant increases between  and  ohare   children of mixed race grew at a faster rate than any other group over the past decade increasing by  percent  the number of hispanic children grew by  percent  the number of non hispanic asian and pacific islander children grew by  percent today more than one fifth of americas children are immigrants or children of immigrants ohare  if these trends continue demographers conclude that soon there will be no majority racial or ethnic group in the united statesno one group that makes up more than fifty percent of the total population crouch zakariya and jiandani  given the demographic landscape of the united states one would expect the number of multicultural books for youth published each year to be significant unfortunately this is not the case since  the cooperative childrens book center ccbc at the university of wisconsinmadison has been documenting the numbers of books published in the united states for children and young adults each year that are written andor illustrated by people of color in  the ccbc received approximately  books of those only  percent were multicultural horning lindgren and schliesman     books had significant african or african american content  twenty eight books had american indian themes topics or characters  ninety one books had significant asianpacific or asianpacific american content and  fifty eight books had significant latino content clearly the books published for children and young adults do not reflect the world youth inhabit and the lives they live horning et al  why is the continued lack of multicultural literature problematic why is the race or ethnicity of the people portrayed in books so important why as i had a white student ask me once cant minority teens just imagine the characters to be their race or ethnicity my cultural perspective doesnt affect my reading i just feel like i am reading about people numerous scholars have addressed this question but i would like to share with you the reasons given by respectively a teen a teacher and an author an african american teen reported this when my eighth grade teacher  shared mildred taylors roll of thunder hear my cry with the class and added several pieces of black literature to the classroom library it was a pivotal moment for me for the first time in my life i realized that i was not alone in the world there were other black girls having experiences similar to mine and some had grown up and written them down i began to write mine down too with hopes of becoming a writer hinton and berry   greg michie a teacher in chicago talking about his students reactions to the house on mango street said this chanclas was the title of the story and thats as far as alejandra got as soon as she read that word aloud the girls all burst out laughing i looked up from my book puzzled as to what had amused them whats so funny i dont know nancy said  thats just not the kind of word you expect to see in a book  its like a nickname or something ive just never seen that word printed up in a book before its not that its funnyits like an inside word you know like a word nobody outside knows you get me nancy had described it perfectly an inside word the more we read the clearer it became to me that every story in the book was filled with such elements little details and nuances that only an insidera mexican americanwould know inside words inside phrases inside sights and soundspeeks into a world nancy and the others knew well but had never before seen within a books pages mango street was unlike anything they had ever read and the girls absolutely loved it michie   sharon flake an author observes black boys will read but to get them off to a flying start weve got to give them books that remind them of homewho they are when this happens they fly through bookseven the most challenged readers they hunger for the work like a homeless man finally getting a meal thats weeks overdue flake   as these statements demonstrate we cannot overestimate the power of seeing or not seeing oneself in literature culturally relevant literature allows teens to establish personal connections with characters increasing the likelihood that reading will become an appealing activity heflin and barksdale ladd   it helps them identify with their own culture and it engenders an appreciation for the diversity that occurs both within and across racial and cultural groups bishop   but i believe multicultural literature can do even more as an integral part of the social and academic context i believe multicultural literature can act as a counter story to the dominant narrative about people of color and indigenous peoples counter storytelling daniel sol√≥rzano and tara yosso define counter storytelling as a method of telling the stories of those people whose experiences are not often told including people of color women gays and the poor   counter stories aim to cast doubt on the validity of accepted premises or myths especially ones held by the majority delgado and stefancic   they offer a perspective that both helps us understand what life is like for others and invites the reader into a new and unfamiliar world  richard delgado who introduced the concept argues that counter stories can quicken and engage the conscience stirring the imagination in ways in which discourse that is more conventional cannot delagado   counter stories can show us that what we believe is inaccurate or false they can highlight exclusionary practices and policies delgado believes that they can even help us understand when it is time to reallocate power  delgado   outlines a number of ways that counter storytelling benefits groups that have traditionally been marginalized and oppressed in the united states by telling and hearing counter stories members of marginalized groups  gain healing from becoming familiar with their own historic oppression and victimization  realize that they are not alone that others have the same thoughts and experiences  stop blaming themselves for their marginal position and  construct additional counter stories to challenge the dominant story members of the majority culture too benefit from hearing counter stories delgado argues that counter stories can help them overcome their ethnocentrism and the unthinking conviction that their way of seeing the world is the only onethat the way things are is inevitable natural just and best   as a counter storytelling tool i believe multicultural literature for young adults serves a number of similar purposes  it gives voice to teens whose voices have gone unheard and whose lives are at best underrepresented but more often misrepresented in the mainstream discourse  it challenges the single story providing a powerful space of affirmation and validation buehler    it presents the complexity of racial and ethnic identity formation  it challenges readers whose lives have been shaped by race and privilege to consider how the world looks to groups of people that have traditionally been marginalized and oppressed raising awareness of the inequalities those individuals face on a daily basis challenging the single story despite the demographic diversity of the united states many americans still live in segregated communities where they are unlikely to encounter individuals who are racially ethnically and socioeconomically different from themselves fry and taylor  multicultural literature bridges the racial and class based isolation that prevents the sharing of diverse experiences across racial ethnic class and cultural lines a counter story can help disrupt what nigerian writer chimamanda adichie refers to as the single story  teenagers of color as well as indigenous people are often victims of a single story latino teens are routinely depicted in the mainstream discourse as low achievers high school dropouts teen parents or violent gang members all stereotypes that paint a picture of an unassimilated population marked primarily by exclusion and difference foxen   the dominant narrative regularly portrays young african american males as criminals crime victims and predators sanders  and african american girls as having one assettheir sexuality national campaign to prevent teen and unplanned pregnancy  asian pacific americans as a rule are depicted as star students especially in math and science supported by industrious entrepreneurial and upwardly mobile parents tatum   and american indians are typically portrayed as people of the past not of the present or the future tatum   adichie argues that the single story is dangerous she explains the single story creates stereotypes and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue but that they are incomplete they make one story become the only storythe definitive story of a people adichie  and in most cases the single story reinforces a deficit oriented stance toward teens of color and indigenous peoplesa stance that represents their race ethnicity culture andor language as limitations sharon flakes poem you dont even know me provides an example of the single story flake  more importantly it demonstrates how multicultural literature can challenge the single story as this section of the poem shows teachers neighbors the media and even their friends try to use a single story to define the young man in the poem i live next door to you you see me on the bus sometimes you even tell me just be quiet child hush then im out with my boys two five or even ten its funny when that happens you dont seem to know me then im just another black boy a threatening scary sight flake   the young man uses his voice to fight back declaring that he is a scholar a musician a neighbor a builder and a dreamer at the end of the poem he declares only i define me and the brightness of my destiny flake   a novel that challenges the single story is the first part last by angela johnson  in this novel sixteen year old bobby becomes a single father when his girlfriend nia lapses into a permanent coma during childbirth how does this book challenge the single story  bobby and nia are both from upper middle class homes and plan to attend college their parents are professionals and they provide nourishing home environments  bobby and nia take sex seriously and are shown valuing their relationship  despite pressure from his and nias parents to give the baby up for adoption bobby takes responsibility for raising feather while continuing to go to school is bobby perfect no that would make the story unbelievable he skips school he gets arrested for spray painting graffiti art on a wall he even forgets to pick feather up from the babysitters house one day however his story the story of a middle class caring responsible and committed sixteen year old black male teen defies the distorted image of black males represented in the media multicultural literature can not only challenge the single story as johnsons novel does but also encourage and empower teens of color and indigenous peoples to take action in their own lives and in the world around them it does this not by denying the hardship and prejudice that many of them face but by showing that despite the disadvantages that correlate with their skin color culture andor social class they can overcome the constraints placed on them by the dominant culture as represented by the single story one book that does this is we beat the street davis et al  this nonfiction text chronicles the journey of three friends sampson george and rameck from a tough neighborhood in newark nj to college and then to medical school their journey is not trouble free along the way they make mistakes face disappointments and nearly fail in order to succeed they must resist buying into the single story themselves and avoid allowing others to use the single story to define them not long after arriving at seton hall rameck severely injures another student who dares to challenge him in front of his cousins rameck explains i had to learn control by no means did i want to forget where i came from or lose my culture i just needed to modify my behavior i had to learn to face a challenge without a violent reaction  i had never been exposed to anything else i gradually learned to discipline myself so that i could deal with challenges with my mind instead of my fists davis et al   at another point ramecks dreams are again almost ended this time by a justice system that adheres to the single story of young black men as perpetrators of crime as rameck and his friend dax a law student are driving home from a professional prizefight they are followed by the police why they sweatin us man dax said we aint done nothing wrong not one thing its not about being wrong its about being black rameck said anger and regret in his voice why do they assume were up to no good dax asked bleakly who knows rameck answered as the three police cars followed their every turn and stop dwbdriving while blackis the newest crime dont you know davis et al   the two young men are stopped frisked and their car is searched when one of the officers finds a small fishing knife in the glove compartment rameck is arrested and charged with interfering with a police officer and possession of a deadly weapon rameck is cleared of the charges only because the police lose the knife these two books and flakes poem are examples of how multicultural literature can challenge the single story they feature young black men who value education have aspirations have a sense of personal responsibility and are self reliant and resilient they feature protagonists who never give up despite the difficulties they facewho hold hope of achieving success and take steps toward getting there buehler  racial and ethnic identity development for teens of color and for indigenous teens coming of age is integrally tied to the process of racial and ethnic identity formation although identity formation is a critical task for all adolescence researchers have found that adolescents of color and indigenous teens are more likely to be actively engaged in exploring their racial and ethnic identity than are white adolescents tatum  as beverly tatum explains teens of color indigenous teens and biracial teens think of themselves in terms of race or ethnicity because that is how the rest of the world sees them tatum  moule  on a daily basis they must navigate a world where other people are making assumptions about who they are and what they can achieve based on their skin color psychologist william cross has proposed a theory of racial identity development that contains five stages pre encounter encounter immersionemersion internalization and internalization commitment cross  the first two stages are pertinent to this article in the pre encounter stage children of color and indigenous children absorb many of the beliefs and values of the dominant white culture including the belief that it is better to be white cross  stereotypes omissions and distortions combined with an image of white superiority to some degree socialize children of color and indigenous children to value the role models lifestyles and images of beauty of white culture over those of their own cultural group tatum  in the encounter stage children of color and indigenous children become aware of the impact of racism this stage usually occurs during late adolescence but it may begin as early as middle school in this stage children of color and indigenous children begin to wrestle with what it means to be a member of a group that is targeted by racism cross  often this awakening is precipitated by an event or a series of events examples include seeing a hispanic parent asked to provide proof of citizenship when he is leaving his place of employment being followed around by security guards at the mall or viewing media images of police brutality against persons of color as tatum points out to find ones racial or ethnic identity one must deal with these negative stereotypes resist internalizing negative self perceptions and affirm the meaning of ethnicity for oneself   this entails answering questions like these what does it mean to be a black hispanic asian or american indian person how should i act what should i do for biracial teens this process is further complicated by the question what am i as teens struggle with these questions they often seek support from other teens who belong to the same racial ethnic or cultural groupothers who understand their perspective and who have experienced similar stereotypes or prejudices and this is where multicultural literature can play a powerful role one of the key goals of counter storytelling is to give voice to the lived experiences of groups that have traditionally been marginalized and oppressed in the united states matsuda  by reading multicultural literature teens of color and indigenous teens gain insight into how other teens who share their racial ethnic or cultural background have affirmed their own identities born confused hidier  tells the story of dimple lala a seventeen year old first generation indian american growing up in new jersey the end of her junior year in high school marks the beginning of a journey of self discovery for dimple when she realizes that she is an abcdan american born confused desi so i was an abcd why hadnt anyone told me why didnt they put this in those spots where they say race doesnt matter but please check one of the following growing up i was always exing asianpacific islander even though i didnt understand why they were treated as the same thing it would have been so much easier to check abcd  i wondered if id ever be an abd  but for now i was an abcd i didnt really know what that meant but i suppose that was the point hidier   that summer dimple immerses herself in the vibrant south asian club culture in new york city attends a student conference at new york university on south asian identity and begins dating a young man who is also indian american throughout the novel she deals not only with the stereotypes others have of indian americans like julian who believes that all indians are gifted in the art of sex but with her own stereotypes of indian americans readers of the book watch dimple embrace her indian culture as a positive part of her identity and find a way to fit the two cultures together taunuja hidlier explains her motivation for writing the novel i hadnt read any books i could recall with a south asian american teen protagonist to the best of my knowledge born confused was the first book with a us female teen desi heroine that was one of the reasons my publisher wanted it and it is certainly one of the reasons i wrote it  it was and is important to me that a young south asian american have a voice and that it be heard and read by people of all backgrounds and ages and it is just as important that other south asian american voices be heard the more out there the more we can begin to approximate expressing the richness and diversity of this culture  a culture that is as diverse as the number of people who make it up hidier  in mexican whiteboy matt de la pe√±a provides insight into the challenges that biracial teens face as they try to forge their identity  danny lopez yearns to be accepted by both of the two worlds he is caught between that of his white mother and classmates and that of his mexican father de la pe√±a writes and dannys brown half mexican brown a shade darker than all the white kids at his private high school leucadia prep up there mexican people do under the table yard work and hide out in the hills because theyre in san diego illegally only other people on leucadias campus who share his shade are the lunch line ladies the gardeners the custodians but whenever danny comes down here to national citywhere his dad grew up where all his aunts and uncles and cousins still live he feels pale a full shade lighter albino almost less than de la pe√±a   when danny decides to spend the summer with his fathers relatives in an attempt to reforge his identity he finds that he cant simply flip some mexican switch and fit right in with the extended family hes lighter skinned and better educated he speaks poor spanish and he knows nothing of the teen culture in which his cousins live bush   his frustration with not fitting in leads him to stop talking and to engage in self mutilation dannys experiences mirror those observed by researchers who study biracial identity formation according to walker poston biracial teens often experience guilt at not being able to identify with all aspects of their heritage and this guilt frequently leads to anger shame or self hatred  resolving the guilt and anger is necessary for achieving a multicultural existence in which teens value all of their ethnic or racial identities poston  by the end of mexican whiteboy after a summer spent playing baseball and getting to understand his mexican heritage better danny has gained strength confidence and self awareness declaring im like me im just myself thats it de la pe√±a   as these two examples demonstrate multicultural young adult literature can provide teens of color and indigenous teens with insight into the process of racial and ethnic identity development it can provide identity affirming experiences and it can help them understand the unique challenges they face it can provide role models and support that may be missing in their schools their homes and their communities exposing the impact of racism central to counter storytelling is an examination of racism and its impact on people of color and indigenous peoples racism is defined as a system of advantage based on racea system that involves cultural messages and institutional policies and practices as well as the beliefs and actions of individuals tatum   the systematic advantages that are conferred on whites as a result of racism are often referred to as white privilege macintosh  these privileges include greater access to housing jobs and health care as well as an impartial justice system as beverly tatum points out despite rhetoric to the contrary every social indicator from salary to life expectancy reveals the advantages of being white tatum   discussions about issues of race and racism often elicit anger denial guilt and defensiveness white people often feel vulnerable and attacked for being white and prefer to believe that the problem is not that racism is present but that it is being discussed okun   people of color and indigenous peoples too may be uncomfortable feeling as though they are being asked to speak for their entire racial ethnic or cultural group multicultural literature can serve as a vehicle for overcoming the silences and discomfort that prevent open dialogue as counter story it is nonconfrontational it invites the reader to suspend judgment listen for the point or the message and determine the truth the story contains delgado   it acts as both a mirrorallowing teens of color and indigenous peoples to reflect on their own experiencesand as a window providing the opportunity for white teens to view the experiences of others the text becomes the tool for a conversation across racial and ethnic groups glazier and seo  many authors of young adult literature take a critical look at the impact of racism and poverty on the lived experiences of people of color and indigenous peoples their characters are aware of the privileges white teens share and they recognize how much less they themselves have been given by virtue of their birthright buehler   they are aware of the institutionalized racism present in the economic educational and judicial systems in ball dont lie  matt de la pe√±a explores the concept of white privilege challenging the idea that the united states is a land of opportunity  where anyone  can succeed if they just pull up hard enough on their bootstraps olsson   in this scene dante a young african american male explains the futility of believing in the idea of the american dream to sticky the novels protagonist dante reaches down to grab a couple of stones off the ground see that wall in front of you he says in america lifes like a race to that wall thats the way i see it he sets the first stone less than a foot from the wall points and says if you born white and got money then you start the race way up here ahead of everybody  but say you aint white and rich say you poor and black or you mexican puerto rican  you may not even have enough food to eat a balanced meal every night  in this case you startin the race of life way back here he points to the second stone only a fool would think someone who starts here has the same opportunities as cats startin at the first stone de la pe√±a   nikki grimes too examines the idea of white privilege in bronx masquerade  at the beginning of the novel tyrone a teenage african american male exclaims white folks who they think they kidding they might as well go blow smoke up somebody elses you know what cause a black mans got no chance in this country i be lucky if i make it to twenty one with all these fools running around with ak s  life is cold future what i got is right now right here spending time with my homeys wish there was some future to talk about i could use me some future grimes   unfortunately national statistics support dantes and tyrones perspectives in   percent of black teens  percent of hispanic teens and  percent of american indians dropped out of high school as compared to  percent of white teens national center for education statistics  the national unemployment rate is  percent for african americans  percent for american indians and  percent for latinos algernon a b in some metropolitan communities the african american unemployment rate is three times the white rate and the latino unemployment rate is twice the white rate algernon a b approximately  percent of all black persons  percent of all hispanic persons of any race and  percent of american indians live in poverty as compared to  percent of all non hispanic white persons denavas proctor and smith  in black and white  paul volponi provides a realistic look at the realities of the juvenile justice system when two star high school basketball players one black and one white commit a crime together marcus is black and eddie white known to all as black and white the two best friends are in the middle of basketball season headed to the playoffs and hoping to get scholarships to good colleges in need of money they borrow eddies grandfathers handgun and pull a series of robberies in dark parking lots one night eddie shoots one of their victims who survives and identifies marcus as one of his assailants it isnt long before eddie is implicated as well but nobody can identify him with the same degree of certainty eddie wont confess and marcus wont betray although the two boys say theyve gotten past all that racial crap they find out that racism is entrenched in the justice system and that it impacts how they are treated in the end marcus ends up in jail for nineteen months while eddie avoids the truth and heads off to college the reality of marcuss situation is captured in this interchange between the two of them the passage is told in eddies voice eddie i dont think taking the case to trial is going to work for me he marcus blurted out parker knows it was me and i dont think i can pretend it wasnt i dont want to screw this up for you maybe your lawyer is just smarter than mine ms torres doesnt think there is a thing she can say to make me look good i need to take whatever she can get me whatever she can get for you what about me my brother you want to plead guilty but thats only going to hurt my case do you get some kind of points from the da for that i eddie yelled at him you lousy little shit he marcus screamed wrapping both of his hands around my jacket collar he drove me back against the side of a brick building and i felt the air pop out of my lungs when i hit we got into this mess together but its just me paying for it and i havent complained one fucking inch about it he seethed with his face pressed up against mine and all you want to know from me is how clean i can keep you volponi   volponis portrayal of marcuss and eddies different paths through the justice system is real and of growing concern according to the annie e casey foundation  compared to the treatment received by white youth policies practices and stereotypes within the juvenile justice system work against youth of color and expose them to greater vulnerability for juvenile detention and compromised outcomes african american and latino youth experience stereotyping and consequent discrimination at every step of the intake and adjudication process including disproportionate arrest using anti gang laws disparate assignment of motivation and blame harmful labeling as super predators inadequate assessment of available family and community resources for detention alternatives and the claim that these youth expect to go to prison in his book the absolutely true diary of a part time indian  sherman alexie depicts the struggles injustices and long lasting effects of historical oppression toward american indians fourteen year old arnold spirit junior lives on the spokane indian reservation in washington state during his first day at high school junior discovers that his geometry textbook is so old that his mother used it in school in anger he throws the book at his teacher and he is suspended this act of defiance leads junior at the insistence of his teacher to transfer from the reservation school to reardon an all white school twenty two miles away there junior attempts to bridge indian and white cultures while at home he copes with a community and a family ravaged by alcoholism and faces the controversy and guilt of leaving the reservation and his own culture i would like to share two scenes from the book that illustrate the issues junior and many contemporary american indian teens facehow to succeed academically in underfunded and culturally unresponsive schools and how to live in the modern world without ceasing to be indian ill begin with the textbook incident i grabbed my book and opened it up i wanted to smell it heck i wanted to kiss it yes kiss it  but my lips and i stopped short when i saw this written on the inside front cover this book belongs to agnes adams okay now youre probably asking yourself who is agnes adams well let me tell you agnes adams is my mother my mother and adams is her maiden name  so that means i was staring at a geometry book that was at least thirty years older than i was i couldnt believe it how horrible is that my school and my tribe are so poor and sad that we have to study from the same dang books our parents studied from that is absolutely the saddest thing in the world and let me tell you that old old old decrepit geometry book hit my heart with the force of a nuclear bomb my hopes and dreams floated up in a mushroom cloud what do you do when the world has declared nuclear war on you alexie   now well fast forward to the end of the book and the day the reardon basketball team defeats the reservation team junior is playing for reardon the buzzer sounded the game was over we had killed the redskins yep we had humiliated them  we had defeated the enemy we had defeated the champions we were david whod thrown a stone into the brain of goliath and then i realized something i realized that my team the reardon indians was goliath i looked over at the wellpinit redskins at rowdy i knew that two or three of those indians might not have eaten breakfast this morning no food in the house i knew that seven or eight of those indians lived with drunken mothers and fathers i knew that one of those indians had a father who dealt crack and meth i knew two of those indians had fathers in prison i knew none of them were going to college not one of them i suddenly wanted to apologize to rowdy to all of the other spokanes i was suddenly ashamed  i ran into the bathroom into a toilet stall and threw up and then i wept like a baby alexie   in  the department of education conducted consultations with federally recognized american indian tribes and american indian school officials and educators across the united states across the board tribal and american indian educators expressed concern regarding funding for the education of american indian children citing subpar school facilities limited access to early childhood education inadequate access to technology and shortages of qualified teaching personnel as the consequences of funding shortages to name just a few us department of education  these inequities apply to schools operated by the bureau of indian education as well as the regular public schools many american indian students attend according to the tribal and american indian educators the failure of the american government to provide a quality education for american indian students has contributed to the perpetuation of a vicious cycle of limited economic opportunities among american indian communities resulting in significant health welfare and justice inequities us department of education   in order to succeed many american indian youth feel compelled like junior to reject their indian culture tribal and american indian educators contend that school curricula should include native languages and histories and reinforce a positive image of american indian cultures as one individual noted administrators and teachers need to be more aware of the native culture of their students because if we do acknowledge their culture it makes them feel valued and gives them self identity us department of education   as these three titles show multicultural literature as counter story can make the oppression and victimization of people of color and indigenous peoples visiblevisible to themselves and to the majority culture it can show that racism and inequality still exist in contemporary american society it can help teens understand racism as a system of advantagea system that is perpetuated when we do not acknowledge its existence tatum   as beverly tatum argues talking about racism is an essential part of facing racism and changing it xix multicultural literature provides a platform for these conversations conclusion multicultural literature that acts as counter story gives voice to those who have been taught to hide their emotions delgado   it speaks to the power of the individual and the collective it shows teens of color and indigenous peoples defining themselves and engaging in problem solving and it emphasizes the importance of self reliance and self determination tatum  it also allows teens in the majority culture to see how the world looks from someone elses perspective it challenges their assumptions jars their complacency and invites them to action delgado   as richard delgado notes stories are the oldest most primordial meeting ground in human experience their allure will provide the most effective means of overcoming otherness and of forming a new collectivity based on shared story
