university libraries face the future keyes d metcalf war re are here today to dedicate a building which is a noteworthy forward step in library co operation i am proud and honored to have been selected to represent the outside library world i take it that i was chosen because some ten years ago it was my good fortune to supervise a study made by john fall of the new york public library of the need for a regional library in the middle west at that time i spent a day with the men who were then presidents of thirteen midwestern universities a group that was struggling with the problem of inter university cooperation i must confess with some chagrin that many of the librarians of those universities were then opposed to a regional library while the university presidents were on the whole favorably inclined toward the proposal funds were not available and the project was held in abeyance for a happier time in the last decade most of those presidents have retired as have most of the head librarians who were then in office the change in presidents did not result in a different attitude toward the proposal happily the change in librarians did some of us are inclined to think that the world moves slowly as far as cooperation is concerned but the fact that we are here today to dedicate this center is the best of evidence that librarians at least have taken long strides during the last ten years i want to take this opportunity to congratulate those concerned with the planning and construction of this building particularly on two counts first on its appearance it is a noteworthy addition to library architecture at its best you can all be pleased by it and proud of it second on its economical construction it was built at no greater cost per thousand volumes housed than was estimated by the university of chicago architect ten years ago when building costs were about half what they are today and that i assure you is no mean feat i was asked to speak on the subject university libraries face the future and i suppose that the title was assigned because i ventured to speak at the dedication of the lamont library at harvard two years ago on the harvard library faces the future that was a difficult task but to speak adequately for university libraries in general is much more difficult the program calls my talk inter library co operatiqp and the future what i have to say will i think fit either title the first and most obvious thing to say about the university libraries of the future is that they will continue to grow some of us have spent a good share of our lives trying to increase the size of libraries and have perhaps failed to realize that one of the easiest things we could do was to make our libraries grow rapidly library growth reminds me of  a paper presented at the dedication ceremony of the midwest inter library center on october    john fall a proposal for a middle west deposit library ms in the new york public library new york ny 
 the library quarterly the sorcerer apprentice who turned on the water but didn know the combination with which to turn it off and so was swamped by the results that is now happening to many of us and while we still enjoy the swimming we are beginning to be worried about the future i often say that one of my duties at harvard perhaps the most important of them is to keep its library from growing as fast as it has grown in the past so far i must confess that i have failed miserably one way to describe the growth of libraries is to observe that we have as many university libraries today in this country with over i oooooo volumes as we had in  with over fourteen in each case during the same period the annual expenditures for books for these libraries have more than tripled rising from an average of less than  for each to about  and the money spent for staff salaries has gone up from a little over iooo for each library to something approaching  while i hope that we shall not grow so rapidly percentagewise in volumes and in money used for staff and books in the next thirty years as we did in the last thirty i think it not unreasonable to expect that in i  we shall have more libraries with  volumes than we had in i with  libraries will grow in size and as one result of that growth they will require more and more money this cannot help meaning that as we face the future we are going to have financial problems perhaps we had better speak plainly and say that we shall be in financial difficulty no library even in the boom days of the late twenties or the somewhat similar period immediately after world war ii ever seemed to have all the funds that its librarian would have liked to have at his disposal we always want more money for more books and then more space to take care of those books we want to spend more money for cataloging not only because there are more books to catalog but because the cost of cataloging increases as the library grows larger and also because there is a tendency on our part to want to do more and better cataloging you may call this a beneficent or a perversive tendency as you like but it costs money for staff and incidentally for space for the staff then for some reason or other the better the librarian the better service to the students and faculty he wants to give and the students and faculty apparently do not object to better service if it is made available so it seems to me obvious that as we face the future there will be a constant demand for larger budgets but there must be a limit to the funds that we can or for that matter should put into our libraries for a large part of the last thirty years we have been living in an age of economic expansion of great university building programs and of rapidly growing student enrolments and as a result we have not realized so fully as we should that in our libraries we have a section of our universities that tends year in and year out in good times and bad to increase in size and cost geometrically while the rest of the institution grows arithmetically it is obvious that this cannot go on without the library taking an ever increasing percentage of our total resources that expressed in other terms means that if we have a fairly stable economic situation that is if we have a return to normalcy and if our libraries are permitted to continue to
university libraries face the future  grow as they have in the past each year and i put it as dramatically as possible professors will have to be dropped so that the money from their salaries can be spent for library purposes this i submit may very well turn out to be an untenable situation from the over all educational point of view one not desirable for the university or for that matter for the library itself sooner or later we shall find that there is a limit to the percentage of the funds in each university that can be properly spent for the library as far as i know there has never been an adequate study made of this problem the figures should of course vary in different institutions one that is interested primarily in the scientific and technological fields and spends a large share of its funds for its laboratories should other things being equal use a smaller percentage for its libraries than an institution that specializes in the humanities and the social sciences an institution that emphasizes its graduate work and has a large research faculty will require larger library expenditures than an institution that is primarily undergraduate in character even if a formula were found on which to base library expenditures it would have to be interpreted with great discretion and changed from time to time the percentage should undoubtedly be increased when a new library building is constructed and then should decrease very gradually of course as the years go on in times such as we have been going through during the last five years when rightly or wrongly clerical and professional library salaries because of the market rate of pay increase more rapidly than the salaries of professors library expenditures inevitably increase more rapidly than those of the institution as a whole if service standards are to be kept up we have recently had a study known as the public library inquiry sponsored by the carnegie corporation and the american library association i suggest that it would be desirable to have the library situation in colleges and universities studied in a similar manner and one of the important points to be considered should be the proper relationship of library expenditures to those of other parts of an institution if such an inquiry is made i do not know what the results will be undoubtedly some institutions will find that they are not spending enough for their libraries and should be urged to appropriate more others will find that they are already spending as much as can properly be devoted to the library without interfering unduly with the rest of the university educational program and a few may discover that their libraries have overexpanded but i am sure that in the years ahead we are going to have to consider more seriously than in the past the rate of library growth which we encourage or permit the total size of the accumulation of books that we gather together and finally the whole question of the weeding out of our collections we may well set an outside figure on the number of books that we can afford to keep on our campuses we should study the cost of weeding and the methods to be used in determining the books that may be discarded we should plan our catalogs and records in such a way that we can de catalog a book less expensively than is now the case in brief when we have found the proper level of library expenditures in relation to the rest of the institution we must manage to stick to it and to do this i am sure that we
 the library quarterly must have more inter library co operation than we have ever had in the past i have talked for a long time in order to provide a background for the main points that i want to make as we face the future with larger libraries greater costs and more financial troubles we must have more inter library co operation along many lines we must for instance go forward with co operative storage in libraries such as this one particularly when by so doing we can eliminate little used unnecessary duplicates but we must not stop there and think of the midwest inter library center as solely or even primarily a storage library for little used books because that is only a part of the picture i think that ultimately there should be in addition to the midwest interlibrary center a number of other regional libraries one in the northeast one near washington in which the federal libraries should join one somewhere in the south and one in the far west i hope that all these will be available not just to a limited number of libraries that take the initiative in starting them but to any library that is ready to co operate and pay its fair share of the costs in this connection let me add that when institutions use collections brought together and financed by others they must expect to pay their way directly or indirectly in addition to these regional libraries i believe that we should have less pretentious and more local institutions such as the new england deposit library to house material that does not require on campus storage but should not be too far away these deposit libraries have their place they have many important features but their scope is limited and they cannot take the place of the regional libraries there might well be one of them in every large metropolitan center i hope that the whole group of regional and deposit libraries will work closely together i am sure that their collections should be recorded in the union catalog of the library of congress and that they should co operate closely with the national library as i have already indicated we should not stop with co operative storage and i am very glad to learn that the midwest inter library center considers storage less important than joint acquisition programs we must have such programs both in connection with and separate from the regional libraries programs through which fewer copies of books that will obviously be little used are purchased in the beginning thereby saving cataloging storage and purchase costs and freeing funds for other much needed books not now available the farmington plan even if it develops much farther than it has as yet should be considered as only one step in this program some of these programs should be connected with the regional libraries but others may be the result of unilateral agreements between libraries within a region as there are some collections that are more suitably stored in a university library than in a regional library in this connection however i think it will often be easier to persuade libraries to join in a regional plan than to agree on co operative acquisition arrangements with another library that may have been a rival in the past a neutral center such as a regional library should be helpful we must forget as far as possible about inter library rivalry we have gone a long way in this direction already by realizing that no one library
university libraries face the future  can have everything and that unnecessary duplication of little used books among libraries reduces the total research resources of the country and just does not make sense on the other hand we must realize that we cannot cure undesirable rivalry any more than race prejudice by going too fast or by being arbitrary in dealing with it and thereby arousing passions it may well be that it would be better theoretically for harvard to send its gutenberg bible and its bay psalm book to chicago because yale has a copy of each but i doubt that we would promote inter library co operation at harvard by proposing it we must not forget about microfilming when that will help or about microcards or microprints i believe that there is a place for all three of these methods of photographic reproduction microfilming should be considered primarily when a single copy or a very limited number of copies is required i might interpolate at this point my belief that microfilm would have come into wider use in the last decade if we had been wise enough to make it particularly for reproductions other than newspapers in sheet form somewhat similar to microprints or microcards instead of in reels microcards and microprints are edition methods they are not economical for a very few copies because of the cost of making the original master negative but they are suitable if a large edition can be printed at once and advance orders can be arranged this brings me to another interpolation which seems appropriate it has been suggested for many years that microreproductions of one kind or another should in the long run replace a large part of our library collections and that these copies could be made available for less than it would cost to store the original volumes in co operative storage warehouses expressed in a different way the theory is that it costs as little for each of a group of libraries to own a microreproduction as it does for the group to share the cost of housing the original i have yet to be convinced with the high labor costs of today that microreproductions are cheaper than the storage of an original already in hand and stored under inexpensive conditions unless fifty copies or more of the reproduction can be sold without great sales expense i suggest that further study be made of this problem neither am i ready to propose that all originals of materials that have been reproduced photographically should be discarded but replacement of the originals in many libraries should be considered if it can be proved that the savings are great if the library already owns a bound volume the saving made by buying a photographic reproduction may be negligible and as i have always said we shall rarely if ever find it possible for any library to replace a large part of its collection by microfilm but if not one of a group of libraries owns a volume the cataloging binding and storage costs as well as its purchase price should be considered we may well find then that if microreproduction is kept in mind from the beginning and the material is copied for a number of libraries at once microreproductions will prove to be even more useful and economical than we have already found them we must incidentally consider the acquisition of material that is used heavily for a short time and infrequently thereafter this may deserve
the library quarterly only temporary cataloging and storage and when the proper time has come we may dispose of it and rely on microfilm copies with perhaps one copy of the original for the whole group of libraries this logically brings us to a kind of co operation that has been neglected up to this time namely the co operative acquisition of master microfilm copies of bulky sets of little used material such as some foreign and state public documents those of us who have had our own microfilm programs ihave been inclined to try to sell as many copies of the film as possible so as to reduce the cost for each copy and have failed to realize that the net cost to the library would would be less if a group of libraries split among them the cost of making master negatives and then made it possible for each of them to acquire or borrow a positive of any part of the microfilmed material when it was needed this may be a field of great importance for a library such as this one some of us will object of course to this as well as to all kinds of co operative storage on the basis that most material is of little use unless it is actuallyunder our roofs at the time it is called for here i think we shall have to realize that we can no longer afford to store in our own buildings all the material that we may want this is a fact that must be emphasized if the midwest inter library center is to be a success our scholars will have to be content in many cases to wait twenty four or even forty eight hours for books or reproductions of books it may be inconvenient it may require a change in work habits but it is practicable for most of us and our methods of research will have to be adapted to current conditions just as they were in the past when many of our scholars had to wait for years until they could make a trip abroad to see the books and manuscripts they needed the choice may be between having several million additional volumes available on one or two days notice and having a small fraction of that number under our own roofs i am sure we must continue the struggle to find better ways and means to carry on co operative cataloging so as to hold down expenses in that field this is another problem that we have by no means solved as yet the library of congress cataloging takes care to a very considerable extent of the needs of our smaller university and college and public libraries this unfortunately is not true for our great research libraries and many of us have found that joining in co operative cataloging as well as adapting library of congress cards resulted in additional expense rather than saving i think that the time has come for a new study of the co operative cataloging situation and for a report on it to the research libraries of the country indeed a full scale study of the whole cataloging situation in research libraries is in order while it is not difficult to argue that the larger the library the more detailed the cataloging should be and the higher the standards used it is also not difficult to prove that spending as much for cataloging as many of us now do prevents us from acquiring additional books and pamphlets that might be even more valuable to research workers than higher cataloging standards a third cataloging problem which must be faced within a generation is whether the card catalog which we have come to take for granted has not
university libraries face the future ii reached a state where it will begin to break down of its own weight in our larger libraries i believe that we shall always have card catalogs for our recently published material but i am not at all sure that we shall not find it more economical and convenient and more useful for research in the long run if a number of our largest institutions in addition to the library of congress print catalogs in book form for older material either independently or better still jointly another problem on which i feel that special study is required is the question of fees for library use by those who have no official connection with the institution owning the volume required such use might include requests for inter library loan as well as use in person i think that most of us have felt in the past that there should be completely free use of material by any research worker but i am not so sure that we are going to be able to promote inter library co operation of the kind that i have outlined if a few libraries carry most of the burden of the cost of acquisition cataloging storage and service of material and then find that the use of the books is largely by others we may well find that a reasonable system of charges for use by outsiders would in the long run encourage library co operation and joint acquisition programs this problem may prove to be one of the most important and difficult ones to be faced by the midwest inter library center all these points which i have discussed seem to me to be of importance but there is another matter which i cannot refrain from mentioning and for which i have no solution i am inclined to think that it may be more serious and more important than all the other matters which i have taken up put together but it is one that we are prone to forget every year that goes by brings closer the time when a large percentage of the printed material in in our great research libraries will have reached a stage so near to disintegration that further use may destroy it our public and college libraries on the whole will not have to worry about this problem for the books that they must have are mostly modern and replaceable and it is easy to arrange to replace books needed by a good many libraries but there are millions of different titles on poor paper in our larger libraries of which few copies are available and though these are not worth reprinting we ought not to let them disappear off the face of the earth microfilming of course will help it has largely solved this problem with newspapers but it and other ameliorating plans have not even scratched the surface of the main problem are we ready to join louis xv and simply say after us the deluge let our successors face the problem of paper disintegration finally we must make a special effort to eliminate as far as possible the further building up and in many cases the continuance of large duplicate collections of very specialized little used material why should a single section of the country have three large collections of friesian literature old textbooks or material on egyptology for instance this question alas cannot be answered by librarians working alone or with one another it will have to be answered on an inter university level by the top university administrative officers a library is primarily a service institution if a university insists on giving advanced work in egyptology
i the library quarterly it is up to its librarian to furnish the material required in spite of the fact that there may be two or three other universities in the region each trying to specialize in egyptology each with only one or two students in the field and each with a large and expensive library collection on the subject but the decision is in the hands of the university and it would seem to me that the heads of the universities must get together and make firm commitments for specialization in such fields as those just mentioned division of fields on the university level not just that of the library is one of the best possible ways to relieve financial pressure for the libraries and for universities as a group and it should release library funds and funds for instruction that can be put to better use in fields not now covered in the same part of the country if at all let me now attempt to summarize what i have said as university libraries face the future they must take into consideration the fact that libraries will continue to grow that they will require larger and larger budgets and that money will be short libraries cannot continue to grow as in the past without taking a larger and larger share of the resources of their institutions unless we can bring about more inter library and inter university co operation that cooperation should include i a careful inquiry into the library costs and their proper relationship to the total expenses of the institution  regional and deposit libraries for the storage of little used collections  joint acquisition programs going on from the farmington plan in which regional libraries should take a leading part  promotion of library co operation in the field of microreproduction  a study of co operative cataloging methods including the question of printing catalogs in book form  an investigation of the desirability of fees for inter library use  an attack on the paper disintegration problem  consideration of the division of fields among universities not just by libraries but by the top level university officers as a group i propose that foundation aid be solicited to finance a study of these problems by a competent outside group and that it be sponsored by the american association of universities and the association of research libraries i further suggest that the midwest interlibrary center would provide a firstclass background for much of the work and that one of the results of the study might well be the development of the next regional library
