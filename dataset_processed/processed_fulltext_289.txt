 journal of education for library and information science seminar addresses a particular problem identified by jonathan cole in his important study about american universities namely their lack of attention to preparing new faculty and leaders cole  this course immerses students into the history and culture of higher education the context for the development of lis education and prepares doctoral students for academic careers we did not examine all schools but focused on ones descending from older schools educating librarians and archivists representing our immediate context namely the school at the university of pittsburgh tracing its origins back more than a century to the training of school librarians we recognize that there are now ischools lacking this lineage emerging from other domains such as communications or computer science given that our school was involved in preparing a self study for the university of pittsburgh reaccreditation by the middle states association doctoral students among other activities worked on assignments to support this self study as we proceeded through this course we found ourselves increasingly drawn to questions about how ischools in their nascent state assess themselves four major areas  reputation evaluating productivity in scholarly publishing student evaluation of teaching and student satisfaction with their academic programs  emerged as the seminar proceeded based on student interest comprehensive coverage was not the aim reputation reputation has become synonymous with quality in higher education emphasizing the prestige of the students faculty programs of study or the school itself often the reputation of a school is reflected through the results of a ranking system where higher ranked schools are perceived as more prestigious or reputable ischools appear to have a similar reliance on rankings of the  us based ischools  post on their website the results from at least one of the available ranking systems how do these rankings relate to the school reputation what qualities or characteristics are key to defining the reputation of an institution of higher education in a two year study of higher education  institutions were visited and surveyed to analyze the industry of higher education focusing on the competition for reputation and prestige brewer gates  golman  the authors define three classes of universities prestigious prestige seeking and reputation based prestigious and prestige seeking organizations compete in four markets student enrollments research funding public fiscal support and private giving such factors are often measured in ranking systems for higher education such as the carnegie classification and the us news and world report many methodologies have emerged for ranking higher education institutions some include a subjective reputational score calculated through surveying deans and other officials while others have based their calculations exclusively on objective measures such as research expenditures while colleges and universities attempt to discredit specific methodologies they also legitimize the rankings through using high ranking scores when they receive them in promoting their schools the competition for higher rankings leads administrators to shape policy with the rankings in mind however ranking systems are not new dating back to before the turn of the th century stuart   webster  one of these first attempts at reputational rankings based on a survey of faculty members at thirty six different institutions occurred in  with raymond m hughes a study of the graduate schools in america  making hughes the inventor of the reputational ranking stuart  p  hughes did a second although unpublished study in  after these first attempts very few rankings would be published for some years
assessing ischools  contemporary reputational rankings continue to follow the example of these early systems the us news  world report survey first published in  relied solely on a reputational score until  webster  today the us news  world report compares similar schools departments and programs with  of the score based on a reputational survey the best colleges are listed according to six different categories based on the carnegie classification graduate schools are listed according to   different disciplines that can be further ranked according to specialty the carnegie classification relies on more objective data and classifies universities based on statistical data rather than providing a list of top schools the top american research universities appeared in  to counter these other ranking systems published through the center for measuring university performance this ranking attempts to provide an objective analysis of american research universities relying on  different measures supported by data reported by universities to third parties such as the national science foundation lombardi et al july  schools are then ranked according to how many factors fall into the top  unlike other systems the result is not a top  list but rather a comparative look at the top schools in the us as competition in higher education is increasingly global attempts also have been made to rank the top schools in the world including the world university rankings which ranks the top  universities based on   indicators in five categories teaching research citations industry income and international mix and the academic ranking of world universities first published in  by the center for world class universities and education of shanghai jiao tong university china attempting to make sense of the multitude of ranking methodologies the institute for higher education polity ihep emerged in  to provide a road map of this complex rankings landscape through the ranking systems clearinghouse the website offers resources for both national and international ranking systems attempting to provide an unbiased look at the myriad of ranking systems appearing world wide working in conjunction with unesco european centre for higher education and the international rankings expert group ireg the ihep has assisted in the formulation of principles for higher education rankings reflecting the academic literature critiquing ranking systems rankings based on a reputational factor such as the us news and world report are specifically criticized for the bias of the reputational score webster  other studies have assessed the quality of the objective statistical data used by other rating methodologies schmitz  kerr  such classification becomes a major issue when ranking ischools seventeen us based ischools report the result of at least one ranking scale on their websites of these  list their us news and world report ranking with little contextual information about the nature of the ranking as few ischools share a common origin with many emerging from lis and others from computer science and technology oriented programs it is difficult to determine how the ischools should be categorized the us news is one of the few systems that report the rankings specifically for lis the us news further complicates the classification of lis programs by reporting the rankings for specialties offered within lis including archives and preservation digital librarianship health librarianship law librarianship school library media services for children and youth and information systems the top research universities also fails to capture the intricacies of the school movement while ischools may be situated within large research universities few of the factors capture data related to the programs within the ischools many of the data points for this system are gathered from the
 journal of education for library and information science national science foundation while the nsf does report data for computer science programs library science is categorized with journalism and communications it is not clear where information technology or telecommunications programs fall within the nsf classification the schools represent a range of undergraduate and graduate degrees and certificates in a variety of programs while the schools may be united under the ischools banner the differences outnumber the similarities what factors are crucial in assessing the quality of schools during the discussions at the first school conference held in  the essential attributes of schools were defined as focusing on information its connection with people and technology multidisciplinary approaches to research academic independence and an active research agenda with a doctoral program bruce richardson and eisenberg  a notable similarity between the schools is their location within research institutions granting doctoral degrees in the prestigious or prestige seeking category where they compete in student enrollments research funding public fiscal support and private giving brewer et al prestige is considered a rival good as prestige is gained by one institution it is lost by another also reflecting the nature of the rankings since much of the rhetoric of the ischool movement suggests cooperation and collaboration perhaps the ischool movement has a unique opportunity to break away from the reputation based rankings and consider other methods for assessing quality such as what has occurred in australian universities focusing on establishing a system of institutions with a common mission competing in the global market as a whole sheil  bradley  if schools can see themselves as a network advancing the goals of the information professions there is an opportunity to move beyond the competitive nature of higher education reflected in ranking schemes through the governance of the caucus schools could also adopt a similar networked approach promoting the caucus standards and benchmarks for the ischool programs this is not to say that all of the schools should offer the same programs rather by embracing the interdisciplinary nature of the schools standards of quality should be established to ensure that the network of the schools is furthering the field by focusing less on artificially established rankings and more on the ultimate goals and objectives of the movement schools can aspire to a quality education that will prepare graduates to become professionals as the idea of schools evolves so should quality standards to provide consistency for longitudinal comparison ranking systems have remained relatively stagnant in their methodology the caucus can provide a set of quality standards that can grow with the new field should these standards be expressed in an ischool specific ranking this question remains to be answered by the schools clearly the rankings fail to capture the interdisciplinary characteristics of the ischools if the primary goal of the movement is to be recognized an ischools category in the us news and world report rankings would be one way to gain that recognition however a continued adherence to the rankings systems would only perpetuate the known problems with the rankings and competition among institutions of higher education kerr  assessments of quality are a necessity for higher education to be accountable to students and as the ischools exemplify one system doesn fit all the myriad of ranking systems only confuses potential students and makes it difficult for administrators to set quality benchmarks recently some commentators have suggested that universities should move beyond the ranking systems and provide relevant information to students faculty and the public directly parker  ischools can embrace this opportunity to look past the traditional measures of quality pro

assessing i schools  disparate notions may seem to be in conflict with one another in an ischool model they represent the assorted configurations of potential collaboration scholarship originating in schools ranges from user studies on children in narrative spaces to data mining and bioinformatics for this reason ischool scholars might consider new ways of assessing the impact of publications that are more in keeping with the values and goals of these diverse institutions examining the contributions of an individual over time and assigning new values to existing rubrics for areas such as collaborative scholarship and the evolving set of journals in which ischool faculty publish could provide a clearer picture of both the impact of schools on scholarly publishing and any emerging trends in ischool scholarship another area that schools can explore is the current lack of ischool specific journals or other publications to date no one has completed a dissertation that focuses on the concept of the ischool itself the lack of existing scholarship about schools points to a need for further study about them the dearth of existing journals addressing the trans disciplinary nature of ischool research and scholarship presents a unique opportunity for today schools and the caucus an journal created by schools would provide a venue for their emergent collaborative scholarship an journal might employ both traditional print and online components allowing for an exploration of more visual or auditory elements of scholarship like those being developed in disciplines such as cyberscholarship and the digital humanities finally the annual conference presents an ongoing opportunity for ischool specific scholarship t o better address issues of measuring ischool impact on research and scholarship schools may also want to improve their tracking of ischool faculty and graduates offering insight into how faculty scholarship has changed and whether or not there has been a shift in dissertation topics or the kinds of employment common to ischool phds these kinds of data analyses may provide insight into whether this change in scholarship precipitated  or is the result of  the appearance of the first ischools in the early part of the   st century students and the evaluation of teaching student evaluation of teaching set is used widely in higher education and generally understood as a means of measuring the efficacy of teachers and the extent of student learning despite questions raised by faculty and scholars as to their validity set results are commonly used in various faculty reviews although not the sole determining factor in promotion and tenure measuring teaching and learning helps in faculty evaluation such evaluation also falls in line with the growing demand for accountability in academia demonstrated in part by documents like the miller commission  report a test of leadership charting the future of us higher education one of the most remarkable and controversial assertions of the miller commission report concerns a lack of accountability in educating students and measuring students achievements such as using the collegiate learning assessment the commission states that the purpose of measuring and gathering data on among other things successful education and student learning is for higher education institutions to demonstrate their contributions to the public good us department of education  p  this type of measurement and disclosure is described as part of the need for educational institutions maintaining public trust set plays a role not only in informing personnel decisions but also as an input for a system claiming to have the public interest at heart and aiming to translate successful education into solid evidence comparable across institutions of how much students learn in colleges or whether they

a ssessing i schools  and that they need to be accountable for what they do in the classroom however when faculty are burdened with layer after layer of bureaucratic assessments that reduce the time for them to keep up in their own field or to do research in it then the natural consequence for many is to disengage from such endeavors and leave it to others to take on this labor as schools strive to establish themselves as new academic programs on their campuses generating new challenges for faculty identities and responsibilities it remains to be seen whether they can meet these new requirements along with the increasing requests from both external accrediting agencies and their own campus administrations for data self assessment and new metrics academic assessment is a reality a form of accountability that none of us can or should want to escape from but the visionary rhetoric that we hear from new academic programs such as ischools suggest hope and promise for more engaging academic endeavors there is a difference of course between the reality and the hope references algozzine b beattie j bray m flowers c gretes j howley l mohanty g  spooner f  student evaluation of college teaching a practice in search of principles college teaching    american association of university professors  declaration of principles on academic freedom and academic tenure retrieved from httpwwwaauporgaauppubsrespolicydocs contents   htm appleton knapp s l  krentler k a  measuring student expectations and their effects on satisfaction the importance of managing student expectations journal of marketing education    bar ilan j  measuring research impact a first approximation of the achievement of the ischools in isi information and library science category  an exploratory study paper presented at the annual conference university of illinois at urbana champagne illinois february   bradley d  review of australian higher education final report canberra ac t dept of education employment and workplace relations brewer d gates s  goldman c  in pursuit of prestige strategy and competition in us higher education new brunswick nj transaction publishers brookover w b  person person interaction between teachers and pupils and teaching effectiveness the journal of education research    bruce h richardson d j  eisenberg m  the i conference gathering of the clans of information bulletin american society for information science and technology    bryant j l  assessing expectations and perceptions of the campus experience the noellevitz student satisfaction inventory new directions for community colleges    cameron m  faculty tenure in academe the evolution benefits and implications of an important tradition journal of student affairs  retrieved from httpsteinhardtnyueduscmsadminmediauserslhcameronjosapdf centra j a  reflective faculty evaluation enhancing teaching and determining faculty effectiveness san francisco jossey bass publishers clayson d e  student evaluations of teaching are they related to what students learn a meta analysis and review of the literature journal of marketing education        cole j r  the great american university its rise to preeminence its indispensable national role why it myst be protected new york public affairs cox r j  the demise of the library school personal reflections on professional education in the modern corporate university duluth mn litwin books crisp g palmer e turnbull d nettelbeck t ward l lecouteur a sarris a strelan p  schneider l  first year student expectations results from a university wide student survey journal of university teaching and learning practice  retrieved from httprouow eduaujutlpvoliss   fishbein m  ajzen i  belief attitude intention and behavior an introduction to theory and research reading ma addisonwesley publishing company haskell r e  academic freedom tenure and student evaluation of faculty galloping polls in the st century education policy analysis archives  retrieved from httpepaaasu eduojsarticleview
