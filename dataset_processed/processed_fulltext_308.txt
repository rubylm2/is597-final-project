a survey and evaluation of minority programs positions in the library profession available to negroes and the question of equal opportunity in promotion preliminary to the development of its program of activities a study was made to determine approximately how many black graduates of accredited library schools there had been in the five years   questionnaires were sent to the deans of accredited library schools in the united states to obtain this information it was assumed that library school records would not reveal the racial identity of graduates but that deans and or faculty members would be able to identify and estimate the number of black graduates in the five year period twenty five library schools estimated the number of black graduates five responded that they could not supply this information and three schools did not respond of the  graduates of  accredited library schools from  through  it was estimated that there were  or four per cent blacks when atlanta university the only predominantly black institution concerned was eliminated there was a total of  library school graduates with an estimated  or two per cent being blacks even though the number of black graduates of these  library schools was based upon estimates this figure is indicative of the fact that a relatively small number of blacks were entering the library profession the library schools of america were charged with the responsibility of changing the racial and ethnic composition of their student bodies to be more representative and responsive to the populations which their graduates serve a number of library schools instituted minority recruitment programs most of them with assistance from the federal government the committee on institutional cooperation a consortium of ten universities instituted a doctoral program for minority or disadvantaged groups financial aid over a three year period was provided for this program the university of illinois and the university of maryland have had minority recruitment programs for several years the university of michigan offers minority programs at the master and doctoral levels in librarianship florida state university indiana university emporia state university louisiana state university university of north carolina at greensboro queens college of the city university of new york rosary college university of texas at austin and wayne state university are some of the other graduate library schools which have established minority recruitment programs 
journal of education for librarianship the intent of this article is to survey the minority programs in selected graduate library schools in the united states to fill an information gap for those who would like to institute such programs but do not know how to go about it although there have been a number of minority programs in graduate library schools information on these programs has been fugitive and sparse more and more graduate library schools will be embarking on their own programs to attract and train minority students but because there exists no data bank of information to assist schools in setting up their own programs library schools have been placed in the position of having to reinvent the wheel the survey of minority programs that have already been tried and tested reveals much useful and insightful information for those schools that are about to develop minority programs the survey developed a list of the complete range of minority programs given by selected graduate library schools and raised questions about  how well the particular program met its stated goals  the problems encountered in implementing the program  sources of funding  the responsibility of the sponsors of the program  the placement problems involved  the type of programs chosen dual track versus the school regular program and the successes and problems encountered by each type the library schools surveyed in this study were those given federal funds for   under title ii b of the higher education act of  as per notification of the us office of education the main interest of the researcher was programs on the master level postmaster programs and doctoral programs were examined if they also happened to make provisions for minority students various techniques were used to determine the number and type of minority programs that have been developed by graduate library schools these techniques included a survey of the literature letters of inquiry careful scrutiny of the catalogs and brochures of library schools describing such programs preliminary discussions with deans and faculty at meetings of the association of american library schools and the american library association and the development of questionnaires to survey and evaluate minority library school programs on site visitations were made to  schools the remaining schools were surveyed through mailed questionnaires and contact with the deans at professional meetings table  at each of the library schools visited the researcher met with the

a survey and evaluation of minority programs curriculum was a basic philosophical framework of the public library as a component in the over all service delivery system in inner city communities the program can be assessed as successful in that placement for those who desired library jobs was excellent and the program was continued in   with ten participants in   indiana university graduate library school awarded   in title ii b funds for a one year institute for training librarians to specialize in urban area community colleges the institute was multi media inter disciplinary and individualized culminating in a mls degree for the  minority participants all the students had some special seminars and some regular courses recruitment was via ala minority group newspapers and person to person contacts the program was significant because it was the first master degree program specifically designed to prepare librarians for a community college setting and because it allowed  individuals of minority status who might not otherwise have been able to do so to advance themselves individually and professionally there is presently no special education program or funds for minority students at indiana in  queens college department of library science received  from the u s office of education under part e of the education professions development act for a one year training program for minority librarians the purpose of the program was to encourage and prepare outstanding highly motivated minority students for effective leadership and support roles as librarians in academic libraries two minority need oriented courses were required as was internship at new york city community college library the funds for this program provided for five minority fellowships until  the program was managed by a black librarian on the staff of the department since his departure from the college it has been managed jointly by the department graduate advisor and assistant to the chairman the program has been adjudged as successful in attracting and educating minority students in reviewing this program seven strengths were identified the location of the program the fact that it was an integral part of the regular program rather than adjunct to it the program flexibility the two minority need courses the internship the advisory committee and its membership and the program continuous system of monitoring and evaluating itself two weaknesses were noted the lack of behavioral objectives and a milestone chart and the failure to attract participants from outside the new york city area a follow up evaluation of par

a survey and evaluation of minority programs programs there was a correlation between receiving an enthusiastic greeting from one advisor and responding with similar enthusiasm but it is unclear which is the cause and which the effect the unpredictable nature probably determines this as much as any factor although it is important in setting the tone for a student stay in graduate school a high level of interest shown by the advisor in working out a student library education program is also related to the warmth perceived in the initial interchange students were asked whether their programs and schedules seemed to be different from those of non minority students and whether the curriculum seemed too hard or about right in some of the programs the courses would be different because of the nature of the specific program in which the student was enrolled that is those schools with dual tracks others might have felt that they were different even though their class schedules were not intended to be any different from those of non minority students there was no differentiation between these two circumstances also minority students might have chosen a specialty that would be out of the mainstream whatever the racial makeup of the student the difference in program however correlated with a feeling that the curriculum was about right and a program that was essentially the same with a feeling that course work was too hard feeling welcome and among friends upon entering library school correlated with feeling involved in orientation with an enthusiastic advisor who is interested in one program with having one work being shown more consideration than others with being invited to discuss one work and other matters with faculty and students with rating one over all library experience as good to excellent it is impossible to say which is the cause and which the effect in any of these correlations however it is more likely that each fortifies the other and is part of the cause and part of the effect in each of the correlations the responses to questions dealing with minority students experiences in library school are enumerated in table  below two hundred seventy two persons gave  responses to this question of all those responding  or  per cent gave a negative response the actual number may be quite a bit smaller as a single person may have given more than one negative response all of this is speculation however and the best solution is merely to disregard all evidence relating to these questions and factors comments were solicited from the students at the end of the ques

a survey and evaluation of minority programs i was obviously slighted by one particular member of the faculty after this person became acquainted with me as a person rather than a minority his attitude changed considerably over all i was treated fairly throughout my library school experience i have been treated fairly by students and faculty except in one instance i was in a special seminar for library services to the disadvantaged in which i was made aware of some prejudices on the part of the professor not directly toward me but toward my people i was disturbed that my fellow students might be influenced by the professor prejudicial statements please note that my experience might have been worse except for one woman who worked in the admissions office she was extremely helpful in every way possible if she couldn answer a question then she would pursue the answer from other sources without her aid advice friendship etc i might have been tempted to drop out the only complaint that i really have is with my advisor i felt that he was too inexperienced to deal with my problems in addition there seemed to have been a lot of politicking and jealousies among individual faculty members some students like myself were caught in the middle my present advisor is excellent in dealing with problems and he offers to help in all areas of the library environment i do however feel that there is much lacking in the program i did feel strange in the predominantly white surrounding and felt that there was little warmth and openness among the faculty they were cold and aloof and often poor teachers of course i also had about two who were quite good and people like although i feel that on the whole i have been treated fairly i do notice that as long as i do more than is required as far as class assignments are concerned i will get an a if i do only what is required the grade will undoubtedly be a b for a b whereas the white students not all  but many will do the required work and get an a or a in other words the discrepancy between my a of more than required work and their whites a of required work is much too wide in order to get an a out of a course i know i must do much more than the required amount of work i certainly expect this in graduate school but all students should have to perform equally well in order to receive an a instead of some working extra hard to get an a and the others doing only what is required and receiving an a an examination of the comments in relation to the responses to 
journal of education for librarianship the other questions shows that those students who had a negative experience with their advisor or a member of the faculty generally rated their library experience as negative those that had a particularly good experience rated their over all library experience as positive this survey has shown that those library schools which did not institute separate programs for minority students were notably more successful than those which did however the factors of feeling positive about library school correlate with having a somewhat different program from other students with similar interests it would therefore seem that the most successful program would have one or two classes relevant to the special interests and needs of minority students as electives together with the regular classes of the curriculum other factors are also important in insuring the success of minority student programs one is the ability to offer financial assistance to minority students either in the form of grantfellowships or assistantships a second factor is the commitment of the dean and administration faculty and students of the library school to the minority student program the results of the student survey show the attitude of the minority students advisors to be especially important in affecting their attitude toward the library school minority students have recorded their library school as unpleasant when there has been a single prejudiced faculty member thus the commitment of all members of the faculty is essential the above findings reveal three essentials to any successful minority student program  the availability of financial assistance  the inclusion of minority students in the regular program of the library school and  the commitment of the administrator students and faculty to the program references  ala ad hoc committee on opportunities for negro students in the library profession progress report to the ala council june   p  also ala th annual conference proceedings p   ibid  walton eugene equality programs office surveys library schools minority enrollments lc information bulletin jan   pp   selected bibliography california at berkeley university of california at berkeley school of librarianship   bulletin  september
