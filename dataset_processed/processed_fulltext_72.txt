lis students and lis professionals on how to be inclusive and culturally competent practitioners the symposium approaches diversity and inclusion as broad issues including race ethnicity gender socioeconomic status education ability language literacy geography and orientation among others with challenges such as internet access digital literacy and digital inclusion being central both to library missions and to the needs of community members meeting the needs of diverse populations and promoting inclusion are at the very heart of much of the contemporary work of libraries the

libraries museums and archives staff of nonprofits and government agencies and diversity professionals the total number of registrants for the  symposium was slightly higher than the total for the first symposium indicating a clear and significant interest in sharing ideas about diversity and inclusion in lis education and professional practice a previous special issue of library quarterly vol  no  featured papers from the first symposium this special issue of library quarterly presents some of the many highlights of the  symposium with speakers converting their talks into articles that convey their key messages in this issue  samantha hastings explores the ways in which lis educators and professionals can work to ensure that in the future our library and information professionals can be representative of the populations they serve  denice adkins christina virden and charles yier detail the interrelated roles of lis education and lis professional groups in promoting diversity

communities the speakers reflected the broad range of attendees and many different educational approaches institutions and perspectives were represented in addition to the talks the symposium featured a student poster session to showcase the work of young professionals and scholars interested in issues of diversity and inclusion the symposium also bridged these discussions to recognition of achievement in diversity among lis professionals and students the james a partridge outstanding african american information professional award was presented to janet sims wood by the citizens for maryland libraries and the college of information studies at the university of maryland thanks to a generous gift from maryland alumna simmona simmons a new award was also created the college of information studies at the university of maryland will now be able to present the simmona simmons best student paper on diversity award each year the number of attendees demonstrates the vital importance of this symposium in driving discussions of diversity and inclusion in lis education research and practice yet some people have raised questions about the need for the event a few have claimed that lis is long past having to worry about challenges relating to diversity and inclusion believing that these problems were fixed a long time agoor were never concerns to begin withand that we do not need to discuss them anymore in the same way that many people in popular media and popular culture speak of a postracial postgender or postdisability world some in lis seem to be seeking a way to avoid addressing significant challenges of difference exclusion and privilege by trying to wish them away the perpetual underrepresentation of certain groups in lis students faculty and professionalsincluding such sizable populations as african americans hispanicslatinos and people with disabilitieshas been well documented over a long period for an overview see jaeger bertot and franklin  jaeger et al  similarly most lis education programs and research have given limited attention to diversity and inclusion for recent data see jaeger et al  mestre  subramaniam and jaeger   which is particularly surprising for a profession with the mission to provide equal service to all as an example consider lis education and diversity related courses approximately  of graduates of lis programs feel that they never had a chance to take a single elective related to diversity or inclusion mestre  among the diversity and inclusion courses offered by lis programs the vast majority are electives most of which are offered infrequently subramaniam and jaeger  furthermore such classes are far less likely to exist at lis programs with larger enrollmentsparticularly ischools subramaniam and jaeger  although some lis programs make diversity a core part of their curriculum jaeger et al  jaeger bertot and subramaniam  most offer no more than a token elective related to diversity and inclusion such a lack of focus in the curriculum demonstrates the overall lack of attention that diversity and inclusion tend to receive in lis education and research although some libraries have amazing projects and programs that reach serve and advocate for underserved and underrepresented populations in their communities the great majority of lis graduates are not prepared in these areas by their degree programs and many libraries do not provide these types of programs and services this perhaps is due in part to the fact that staff members may not have been sufficiently prepared by their education to work in these areas and they may remain ill prepared as professionals there are very strong and pressing reasons for the symposium on diversity and library and information science education and other forums for better addressing issues of diversity and inclusion across lis professions education research and practice one of those reasons can be found in the attitudes of some lis professionals whose views have even made their way into published lis literature a perfect example of these attitudes was seen among the new books for the review section of the journal just a few days after the symposium crash course in dealing with difficult library customers libraries unlimited  by shelley e mosley dennis c tucker and sandra van winkle is part of a series of quick reference guides for library professionals with titles devoted to topics such as story time genealogy and administration issues the books in this series are designed to be references to have on hand in any library meaning that they will be read by and influence the practice of many library professionals in theory having a quick reference book on dealing with difficult situations seems perfectly reasonable as there are a large number of potential problems that can occur when interacting with members of the public in any setting being prepared to deal with issues of criminality or safety is of course a very good idea this particular book however presents a rather alarming portrait of the ways in which librarians might view and interact with their communities the ultimate goal of focusing on diversity and inclusion issues in lis education research and practice is to make a library and its professionals a more integrated part of the community that they serve that means being a member of the community being knowledgeable about the community and the various populations it comprises and being welcoming to all populations in that community those focused on diversity and inclusion in lis try to prepare students to work effectively with diverse populations so that they are able to make the library a truly inclusive environment this book in contrast paints the job of the librarian as one of exclusion by labeling a surprisingly wide variety of groups as difficult or problematic although there is a nod to cultural diversity and a few brief paragraphs in the general guidelines encouraging librarians not to stereotype the included definition of stereotyping is primarily restricted to those who dress differently than mainstream america and readers are reminded that just because someone has piercings and tattoos doesnt mean that theyre in the library to hurt you  the overall tone of the book is condescending with snarky section titles that mock their subjects eg vandals this is why we cant have nice things or smelly people the hygiene deficient and other stinky patrons this tone would undercut the seriousness of the book but for the fact that the assemblage of problem groups is quite simply bewildering patrons who are indecisive shy quiet mumblers and those who are self important are given the same level of significance as abusers and arsonists many descriptions of the problem groups are simply complaints about the changing nature of working in a library particularly the more prominent social service roles that libraries have been taking on over the past decade the unemployed the homeless and those seeking to apply for government benefits are singled out as problem groups regarding these particular groups the book showcases an exclusionary streak present in some parts of the library community the homeless are deemed problems both for having nowhere to stay and in a separate section for being smelly perhaps the oddest section explains how the unemployed are a danger to children by far the most disturbing section is the one on mentally ill patrons although it is important for library staff to be aware of potential warning signs the descriptions of common mental illnesses are outdated insensitive and in some cases inaccurate it should be noted that there are no citations indicating the origins of the seemingly clinical descriptions in one example the authors actually equate intellectual disabilitiesa  something woman with the mental abilities of a  year oldwith mental illness  people with disabilities and mental illnesses are presented as monsters including the jarring and wildly incorrect assertion that people with obsessive compulsive disorder are physically violent and even a reference to one patron as ms hyde the language throughout the text is decidedly us the librarians versus them the patrons inclusivity in the form of customer service is given lip service but the overwhelming attitude is one of exclusivity unfortunately such attitudes are far from uncommon among library professionals an excellent article by lynn westbrook which was recently published in library quarterlyabout the resistance of some librarians to helping patrons in areas of social service demonstrates the strength and depth of these attitudes among some in our field it is one thing not to want arson occurring in the library it is a very different thing not to want people searching for a job in the library at their core such complaints reflect a rejection of the inclusive mission of libraries the symposium on diversity and library and information science educationand all other education research and professional initiatives related to better preparing lis students and professionals to be inclusive practitionersare vital to the future of the field because of this inclusive mission services to people who need help finding a job learning digital literacy skills getting government assistance or finding shelter are all parts of serving the community the message clearly still needs to be proclaimed loudly if the crash course book is any indication across the articles in this special issue of library quarterly the authors discuss ideas initiatives and programs that are devoted to the goal of inclusive service to the community and preparation of lis students and professionals to be culturally competent and socially engaged community members as the country becomes more diverse and there are fewer community institutions providing social support the future of libraries and library professionals is inextricably linked with diversity and inclusion in her article in this issue samantha hastings rightly asserts that encouraging diversity is one of the most important things we do as educational institutions considerations of inclusion access human rights and social justice need to be guiding our approach to working with community members rather than belief in the exclusion of those who do not fit the notion of an idealized patron from long ago
