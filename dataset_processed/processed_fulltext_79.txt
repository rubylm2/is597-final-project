information literacy a contradictory coupling christine pawley information literacy has established itself as an important subfield of librarianship yet although librarians justify information literacy as increasing democratic participation by all citizens their efforts to improve quality control of information also threaten to restrict choice in systematic ways this contradiction results in part from the genealogy of the terms information and literacy terms that share a relationship traceable to an enlightenment ideology namely that reading could transform society by informing its people but reading power to transform was also a contested issue for groups seeking political and cultural ascendancy and reading genres that initially challenged conventional thought evolved into those that buttressed it in the process some groups came to be defined as information consumers and simultaneously excluded from the role of information producers strategies that can raise awareness of the assumptions underlying this legacy include critical analysis of language use and envisioning information use as a process that involves all users in both consumption and production adopting these can help librarians recognize that the tensions inherent in the discourse and practice of information literacy are not only unavoidable but essential if the basic condition of democracy citizen participation is to be fulfilled the problems we face are not really technical they are moral they are ethical a reliance on technical solutions leaves us still gasping still empty maxine greene  p  information literacy denotes an emergent professional and institutional practice as james w marcum comments over the last decade  the author would like to thank the following for their help in formulating the ideas expressed in this article larry amey alan bundy thomas elandjames elmborgjoyce kirk raymond g mcinnis ross todd and the five anonymous reviewers for the library quarterly who commented on the manuscript  christine pawley school of library and information science university of iowa iowa city ia   telephone    e mail christine pawleyuiowaedu  christine bruce traces the use of the term information literacy back to the late s and relates it to early developments in computer based information technology but it was not until the s that it began to enjoy widespread use  pp   libraiy quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
information literacy  information literacy has established itself as a major focus and purpose of librarianship a field that has successfully drawn to itself considerable resources in terms of library staff and curricular time not to mention policy making energy  p  library and information science lis professionals have developed information literacy in response to a variety of pressures complaints in the mass media about information overload especially on the internet a constant flow of breathless reports from the information industries about advances in new technologies and institutional pressures that include the presence of the very electronic resources that librarians themselves have acquired for use definitions of information literacy abound but most include the following elements resource based learning critical thinking and life long learning educators and librarians depict the skills to use and locate information in a variety of formats and the intellectual ability to evaluate such information as techniques or tools essential for a successful adaptation to the rapid social and technical changes that we will all face we are told throughout our lives in  carla j stoffle dean of libraries at the university of arizona in tucson wrote in american libraries success in the next century personal professional civic and economic will depend on the ability to participate intellectually in the emerging knowledge based society the knowledge explosion and economic changes brought about by the rapidly expanding information telecommunication technologies require individuals to be skilled independent learners t he average st century worker may need the skills to cope with as many as seven major employment changes in his or her lifetime  p  library educator daniel callison summarizes definitions of critical thinking for school library media activities monthly staff and teachers thinking critically is the cognitive process we use to carefully examine our thinking and the thinking of others in order to clarify and improve our understanding critical thinking is reasonable reflective thinking that is focused on deciding what to believe or do  p  such descriptions locate information literacy at the intersection of teaching and learning along one dimension and information production and distribution along the other the composite term information literacy is an example of discourse synthesis as raymond mcinnis  in  the american library association presidential committee on information literacy stated information literate people are those who have learned how to learn they know how to learn because they know how knowledge is organized how to find information and how to use information in such a way that others can learn from them they are people prepared for lifelong learning because they can always find the information needed for any task or decision at hand  p 
 the library quarterly reflects if two or more concepts are combined  does the resulting concept produce a new understanding and are new larger concepts generated  pp   most librarians would probably argue that information literacy is indeed an activity greater or at least different from the sum of its parts and the conjoining of information and literacy sets up a powerful resonance the so called information age has become a defining metaphor of our time while literacy is what philosophers call a hurray word like democracy and apple pie who can be against it small wonder then that librarians and lis educators have welcomed the wedding of the two ownership of so politically charged a term assigns rights and privileges it provides justification for resources including staff equipment and research grants and funds for program development in universities and colleges information literacy often appears on the undergraduate curriculum and is an important area of library staff expertise for librarians charged with responsibility for teaching courses in information literacy this may represent success in an ongoing battle to garner maintain or divert funds these days only meagerly distributed by university administrators similarly in k  schools information literacy appears on the curriculum with increased frequency some states have identified information literacy as a key competency for all students public librarians too talk of the need for information literacy among the general population courses in information literacy take place in the graduate curricula of lis schools a growing professional literature focuses on practical and technical aspects of developing standards and implementing information literacy  discourse synthesis is the process by which new ideas and concepts become incorporated in the body of knowledge and for some ideas become part of the stock of knowledge what everybody knows  in a discussion of epistemological and strategic issues connected with use of the term information literacy loanne snavely and natasha cooper produce a list of thirty four examples of the use of the term literacy to denote basic knowledge in a subject or field they also suggest thirty six alternative terms to use instead of information literacy   for example the web page of the university libraries at the university of iowa states clearly information literacy should be a key component in each student education and the university libraries encourages the university of iowa to implement information literacy throughout the curriculum  at the university of wisconsin madison all incoming freshman are required to take a two course sequence that includes information literacy components and that is mainly taught by campus librarians   the state of wisconsin has established standards for information and technology literacy that identify competencies for all students from pre kindergarten through grade    the mission statement of the chicago public library for example includes the statement we welcome and support all people in their enjoyment of reading and pursuit of lifelong learning 
information literacy  programs in educational contexts yet even an innovative professional practice carries with it the marks of its inheritance its genetic imprint although the implications of these characteristics may be poorly recognized investigating the genealogy of the contributing terms information and literacy can bring some of these hidden traits to the surface and can alert practitioners to underlying tensions and inconsistencies that have the potential to deflect their practical programs however wellintentioned and conceived from their ultimate goals first i argue that combining the terms information and literacy sets up a tension between conflicting ideals of on the one hand a promethean vision of citizen empowerment and democracy and on the other a desire to control quality of information that has the potential to result in albeit unintended procrustean consequences however contradiction is not new to the field and rather than try fruitlessly i believe to resolve this tension we should focus on understanding it and laying it open for inspection and discussion second i contend that conceiving of information as a thing the reification of information has permitted us to treat it as a commodity a development that has actually facilitated the institutionalization of libraries and their core activities cataloging and reference third i go on to show that the development of information genres such as reference and textbooks has contributed to the decontextualization of information obscuring the specific conditions of its production fourth i argue that although enlightenment ideology saw information use in terms of building concepts and empowering he public to create new knowledge the pedagogy of reading and policies to promote literacy have systematically worked to render some groups of people indeed the majority less capable of active information use and knowledge construction than an educated elite finally in conclusion i contend that although the contradictions that these inheritances have built into information literacy cannot be dissolved we should see the tension between them as creative and helpful the lis community also needs to pay more critical attention to language use by engaging in critical analysis so as to understand the specific conditions under which information is produced as a step toward involving users in recontextualization and expanding the category of information producer to encompass those  in the greek myth prometheus son of a titan takes pity on humans and gives them fire he thus empowers them to improve their lives by stimulating their creativity and enabling the development of the arts and sciences procrustes on the other hand is a robber who waylays travelers and forces them to lie on a terrible iron bed if they are too short to fit the bed exactly he stretches his victims if they are too long he chops off their legs either way death is the result
 the library quarterly previously excluded we can achieve and maintain a balance between constraint and liberality that will promote the most emancipatingpromethean institutional and professional practices of information literacy language and ideology built in contradictions the language that the lis community uses to develop the concept of information literacy is of course heavily dependent on the traditional style of argument and explanation in the field since the prevailing style of lis discourse uses techno administrative language to address technical and managerial problems most professional literature describes applied research into information literacy provides economic and educational justifications for its existence and passes on practical tips and recommends methods of evaluation this literature is mainly expressed in terms of managerial and pedagogical theories and concepts is addressed to teachers librarians and educational administrators and can be found not only in scholarly and professional journals but also in monographs and edited books commercial publishers produce how to manuals and compilations of materials like the libraty orientation series emphasizing information literacy and bibliographic instruction published by pierian press clearly information literacy has already gone a long way toward institutional acceptance for many librarians however the ultimate ideal of information literacy is to promote citizen empowerment and democracy a promethean paradigm that is hard to express in conventional technoadministrative discourse the association of college and research libraries acrl information literacy competency standards for higher education for example includes the goal of creating a more informed citizenry  this aspect of information literacy emphasizes providing information users with unfettered access to a wide variety of sources but because statements like the acrl competency standards also refer in the techno managerial tradition to the need for effective and efficient information access and lay out the evaluative criteria on the basis of which information should be selected information literacy also has the capability to produce and sustain a hierarchical system wherein expert authorities determine what counts as knowledge such an approach emphasizes control rather than freedom and a narrowing as opposed to a broadening of selection to those sources deemed valuable rather than opening up possibilities for social cultural and economic participation in knowledge production by all citizens the tendency of this procrustean paradigm is to fit all contingencies to an iron bed the dimensions of which are
information literacy  predefined by a cultural social and economic elite it would appear then that the very notion of information literacy embodies a tension between opposing aims what can be made of these contradictory potentials contradiction is not new to the lis field and indeed american librarianship from the mid nineteenth century on has experienced some persistent tensions that are detectable in the rhetoric surrounding information literacy in a  paper aptly titled ambivalence and paradox the social bonds of the public library phyllis dain contrasted sidney ditzion progressivist view of public libraries as arsenals of a democratic culture with the recent revisionist interpretations of michael h harris and dee garrison   that year harris had shocked yet intrigued the lis community with an article about the founding of the public library movement influenced by recent revisionist interpretations of public school history he argued that rather than emanating from liberal and humanitarian zeal as described by ditzion public libraries were generally cold rigidly inflexible and elitist institutions from the beginning  p  at about the same time garrison essay drew on contemporary feminist thought to introduce the theory that gender was crucial to explaining librarianship low status  rather than choosing one interpretation over the other however dain sensibly pointed to the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches since then library historians have tended to follow dain recognizing the virtues of sitting on the intellectual fence in  evelyn geller published a sociological account based on her  phd dissertation at columbia university of changing attitudes among cultural authorities including the library profession to intellectual freedom  geller pointed out that at different periods in time librarians shifted their ideological stance in ways that expressed three dilemmas first a populist elitist dilemma expressed a conflict between the tastes of cultural professionals and sponsors and more popular taste second a neutrality advocacy dilemma contrasted the librarian role as civil servant responsible to the entire community  hope a olson relates that when melvil dewey classification system was accused of procrustean tendencies dewey defended himself by likening his ten divisions of the universe of knowledge to a railroad better and quicker and cheaper but olson argues we should remember that etter and quicker and cheaper is always at a price and the price is the violent reshaping of objects to fit the preconception of the knowing subject  pp    this article ensured that harris critique would reach a wide audience but it was based on a much longer and more thoroughly documented report that harris prepared for the eric clearinghouse on library and information sciences and that later appeared as the role of the public library in american life a speculative essay 
 the library quarterly with her desire to exercise social responsibilities in ways that question the value of neutrality and third in a freedom censorship dilemma librarians struggle with ideas considered to fall outside the framework of conventional debate ideas that seem to threaten the moral or social order for librarians these dilemmas geller argued can never be resolved they inhere in the field they come with the job contradiction then is a condition that characterizes the field and echoing concerns of the earlier periods the theory and practice of information literacy continues to raise issues of freedom versus control and diversity versus standardization these self contradictions are unavoidable yet the failure to acknowledge and come to terms with them could magnify the potential for unconsciously subverting a fundamental belief to which most librarians adhere without reservation support for citizen empowerment and democracy information reification and commodification to uncover these contradictions we need to investigate the heritage of the two contributing terms information and literacy while most commentators assume that information literacy is merely a marriage of convenience pointing to the pairing of literacy with many other partners in fact the two terms share an inheritance and the common link is the social practice of reading the term information as we understand it today traces its ancestry to the enlightenment and the development of a rationalist belief that people could be shaped for the betterin formedthrough reading that the printed word could influence moral behavior went back further of course at least as far as the reformation but it was during the eighteenth century that were laid the foundations of what michel de certeau calls the ideology of nforming through books or the yth of educationthe belief that books could if they were sufficiently widespread remodel a whole nation  p  indeed according to benedict anderson it was print and reading that permitted imagined communities to form of which nations another developing concept in the eighteenth century constituted a major example  and along with the spread of scientific attempts to discover laws of nature came the gradual acceptance of standardization and regulation in print of for instance uniform rules of spelling another example was the eighteenth century development of reference books  see for example wayne a wiegand contrast of librarianship focus on useful knowledge rather than stories 
information literacy  while reference books were not new at that time an enlightenment focus on discovering knowledge rather than seeking wisdom from the past endowed them with a different character ephraim chambers two volume cyclopedia or an universal dictionary of arts and sciences appeared in  the encyclapedie of denis diderot and jean de la rond dlembert was published in thirty two volumes between  and  samuel johnson a dictionary of the english language came out in  while the encyclopaedia britannica was first published in subscription form between  and  these major intellectual enterprises were not undertaken in order to maintain fixed standards of truth and certainty unlike their medieval predecessors rather their authors and publishers saw them as tools for debate and instruments of philosophy to facilitate the exchange of new ideas according to richard yeo the encyclopaedias of the eighteenth century were a practical embodiment of the notion that knowledge should be accessible to a wide public and as such their purpose was not just to collate knowledge used by elites but to facilitate conversation and communication  p  mcinnis too argues that these conversations formed the basis for interpretive communities and that dictionary makers like chambers deliberately sought to transmit the new methods of intellectual engagement to a broader public  p  n  some were highly polemical in contrast to the neutral understanding of reference works common today in particular diderot encyclopedie presented a threat to french authorities in that it challenged rather than confirmed existing official knowledge with the publication of the encyclopedie for the first time contends john ralston saul an alphabetical analysis of civilization looked not backwards but forward through innovative social ideas  p  the choice to alphabetize had consequences that the early composers of dictionaries and encyclopedias could hardly have foreseen although it was not without controversy even in the eighteenth century some contemporary critics argued that alphabetical arrangement of entries entailed the abandonment of the search for an orderly overview of the circle of knowledge  p  while isaac watts praised it as facilitating consultation rather than sustained reading   with the publication of the very first volume officials understood the danger it represented the encyclopedists identified their philosophy with knowledge itself that is with valid knowledge the kind derived from the senses and the faculties of the mind as opposed to the kind dispensed by church and state argues robert darnton traditional learning they implied amounted to nothing but prejudice and superstition so beneath the bulk of the encyclopedie twenty eight folio volumes and the enormous variety of its  articles and  plates was an epistemological shift that transformed the topography of everything known to man  p 
 the library quarterly p  n  but imposing alphabetical sequence on encyclopedia articles and word definitions and thus removing words from their context also promoted the reificationthe thingness of information in the early nineteenth century the prevailing concept of information was still as an active verb as instruction that shaped the mind or character but because this instruction increasingly derived from the practice of reading books by the middle of the century the meaning of information had undergone a strategic shift so that linguist geoffrey nunberg points out information was taken to denote not the instruction derived from books but the content of books from which the instruction is derived  p  my emphasis this shift had the effect of resituating the agency of instruction to the text and its producers and reducing the reader to the role of passive consumer of content in other words information had shifted from an effect to a cause but a cause inextricably linked to books and reading  pp   according to nunberg our present day abstract understanding also arises from a conflation of two senses of the word on the one hand he argues we are familiar with an ordinary particularistic sense as in i looking for a book about guinea pigs on the other hand when we talk about the information age or information overload we are thinking in a more abstract sense about a kind of intentional substance that is present in the world this is the sense of the word which bears the ideological burden in discussion of the new technologies  pp   but we confuse these two senses so that even in the abstract we have come to think of information as a thing the first copyright law in england the act of queen anne in  also contributed to acceptance of this concept jorge reina schement and terry curtis maintain that this thing like perspective forms the conceptual foundation for the information society making it possible to conceive of buying and selling information possessing more or less of it stealing it and storing and retrieving itall essential to commercialization and commodification  p  a commodity literally is a thing that is produced to be bought and sold in a market in a precapitalist system of production people may produce goods and services for their own use they grow their own food make their own clothes and furniture and entertain themselves if they produce more than they need for their families they may exchange this surplus for something produced by a relative or neighbor but for this sort of exchange to become a regular event the two products must be systemati while the meaning of information has been the subject of repeated and repetitive debate in us circles the thing like quality of information enjoys widespread acceptance and indeed advocacy see especially

 the library quarterly american librarianship first professional journal to the need for an intermediary to link readers with books  nunberg dubs library products such as classification systems catalogs and indexes along with reference materials and newspapers as informational genres these genres support certain practices of reading practices that reinforce the impression of information as an abstract thing what these information genres have in common nunberg says are particular properties for instance they are uniform and morselized uniformity arises from the separation of their content from their material form the essence of the information in the newspaper is irrelevant to the details of the newspaper physical layout the size of the font the color of the ink the number and size of pages and so on morselization has to do with quantization or atomization that makes its measurement possible so that information can be broken into small chunks or little atoms of content propositions sentences bits infons morceaux that can be disconnected and recombined counted stored and retrieved  pp    the newspaper for example presents all historical events as events of immediate daily significance each occurring in a single place  p  although a newspaper content is tremendously varied consisting of reports of political events and natural disasters gossip columns editorials letters obituaries advertising and so on these tend to lose their individual character all can be described in terms of column inches the newspaper material form interacts with the formatting of its contents in discrete information packets to encourage the practice of reading in short discontinuous bursts similarly library catalogs reduce all materials no matter what the format or subject to a standard set of descriptions producing information that stands as a surrogate to the original but at the same time obscuring the individuality of the original  p  these qualities of morselization and uniformity contribute to our impression of the informational genres as standing alone lacking history authorship lacking context of production an informational genre that nunberg does not discuss is the textbook but like newspapers reference books and library catalogs school and college textbooks consist largely of uniform packets of information that have been taken out of context and then recombined textbook reading like reference book and newspaper reading takes place in discontinuous segments rather than start at the beginning and read through until they reach the end many students and teachers dip in and out of their textbooks fitting the pattern of their reading  for a definition of an infon see 
information literacy  to the demands of the curriculum rather than the other way around again the voice of the author is muted textbooks take on a disembodied decontextualized life of their own it is true that some famous textbooks that have persisted through many editions and over the years may be known only by the name of the original authorsamuelson in economics for instance or perry in chemical engineering but this is also true of reference books   although we may refer to a dictionary as webster we do not hold the long dead webster personally responsible for its contents the personalization of these works is a mere metonym a metaphor in which a part stands for the whole recontextualization and the enlightenment model of information diffusion yet this apparent decontextualization is illusory information never stands alone it is always produced and used in ways that represent social relationships and these representations and relationships are not merely a matter of chance or individual choice but reflect the underlying patterns that structure society all information use involvesin michael apple termrecontextualization a process by which users make active sense out of the information packets that they encounter  p  in enlightenment epistemological theory the discrete packaging of information allowed readers to recontextualize the information content in ways that permitted them to produce new knowledge as mcinnis explains by bundling their concepts into concrete like entities scholars are able to move concepts at will from text to text  p  according to this theory the active reader employs the information packets as bundles or building blocks to combine them in potent and innovative ways this treatment of concepts as the component parts of a metaphorical construction lies at the heart of information literacy ideology and may appeal to librarians on a number of grounds it promotes a progressivist theory of knowledge which many may find reassuring it also encourages us to think of readers or information users as possessing agency as active builders of knowledge thus occupying a central position in the information process a view that supports the promethean paradigm of information literacy but before exploring this conception of the active user in more detail we need to pause and recognize that focusing exclusively or even principally on users agency threatens to obscure the relational character of the process of knowledge production by minimizing structural features that act to deprive
 the library quarterly users of agency we risk ignoring the ways in which the material and intellectual qualities of textual production and distribution shape readers experiences this provides an example of what sociologists call the structure agency dichotomy as david walsh explains  every conception of social structure must ultimately reduce to what people do in society yet society always consists of particular and institutionalized forms of the organization of these actions these cannot work however without the commitment of actors to them the question of structure and agency then is whether this commitment is simply enforced or entirely volunteered and how it is possible for it to be a combination of both so that social structure is both achieved by and constitutive of social action the point is under what conditions and how does this occur  pp   enlightenment information products like those of today were created owned and distributed by members of an educated elite yet the apparent decontextualization of texts permits the stratified nature of their production to recede into the background and even to disappear the enlightenment model of information diffusion as many commentators have famously pointed out was a top down structure in which the wisdom of literally the masters was legitimized naturalized and presented as fact to everyone else be they women children the poor the illiterate or non europeans in other words processes of textual production and recontextualization were confined to the privileged few michael apple uses the word de locate to describe the process by which curricular knowledge is removed from its original context in order to be recontextualized or relocated in a new pedagogic situation the original knowledge from academic disciplines differing social groups and so on apple points out is appropriated by those groups of people who have power in the new context in the case of school textbooks for example these recontextualizing agents consist of textbook publishing houses content consultants and state and local educational authorities  p  the relocating process removes the text from the professional discourse of researchers it also modifies the text how textbook writers present material depends on prevailing pedagogical theories doubtless they will also select material that they can present clearly and perhaps that is noncontroversial these selection procedures are not random systematic forces come into play curricula are rooted in differential power in a set of social relationships that ultimately play a large part in determining whose cultural capital is made available and elocated in our schools apple  michel foucault is perhaps the most often cited see for example 
information literacy  argues only by understanding the interaction between the forces acting on government regulation and on the economics of textbook publishing can we determine how such decontextualizing and relocating works  p  the process that apple describes with respect to textbooks can be applied mutatis mutandis to other information genres including library printed and electronic reference materials publishers editors designers and scholars work together to distill synthesize and rearrange printed texts so that they take on the uniform recognized and authoritative features of encyclopedias handbooks gazetteers and so on of all the print materials in the library modern reference materials are presented as among the most decontextualized authors recede into the background the authorial voice muted or silent many encyclopedia articles appear without accompanyingjustification in the form of references or citations the information encapsulated in an article stands alone authoritative by virtue only of its presence in the volume legitimacy is conferred by its place on the library shelf although great variation can be found in the standard of production and scholarship in reference books library patrons trust librarians who themselves rely on the judgment of reviewers to select only the best marcia bates even describes reference works metaphorically in terms of files and fields as an electronic database inverting the more usual practice   the discourse of information literacy and indeed of lis in general provides few alternatives to this dispiriting portrait of monolithic social control while in the past lis researchers have too often presented information use as a relentlessly utilitarian activity in which metaphors of searching and retrieving receiving and transmitting prevail information users are depicted as passive consumers of information products information literacy is a matter of making enlightened and informed consumer choices yet if the enlightenment model of information diffusion also leaves little room for differences along such dimensions as class race and gender to emerge lis practitioners and researchers interested in a more multidimensional picture of information use and of users as active participants in these processes can draw inspiration from two parallel scholarly movements  more familiarly computerized materials have adopted the metaphor of the book especially in the use of the term page for instance  james marcum criticizes the information processing paradigm as a problematic foundation    on which to construct a compelling model of learning and information literacy for oversimplification faulty logic and overworking the concept of uses of information  p 
 the library quarterly in the s and s one from within lis the other from print culture history first was the development within lis of user centered models of information use as dervin and nilan outline in their now classic literature review during the late s and s researchers attention shifted from a system oriented theory of information needs to a cognitive approach to information seeking behavior that focused instead on individual users consciousness and inner worlds  dervin cast her own sense making approach in terms of a situationgap use a model in which information users employ sense making techniques to bridge a gap between their personal situations or contexts and the information available for their use thus user centered work shifted from viewing information as objective and users   as input output processors to information as something constructed by human beings and users as beings who are free to create from systems and situations whatever they choose  p  but while the cognitive approach gained currency in the s during the s some lis researchers used foucauldian discourse analysis to critique the cognitive view as depicting information use as a mental process taking place inside the individual user head producing a radical individual view of information use that neglected structural constraints such a theory had political implications a discourse of radical individualism supported by polarizations of inner and outer and of ense making as a radically individual act wrote bernd frohmann in  becomes ideological in a society of to borrow from chomsky necessary illusion and manufacturing consent where nformation stores and nformation needs are constructed and contested on behalf of specific interests and where image production and manipulation are highly politicized social practices  p  sanna talja used a discourse analytic approach to reconceptualize users as knowing subjects or cultural experts at the same time she argued researchers need to reconceptualize information systems as participation systems in the organization and systematization of social knowledge  p  in a  article that perhaps recognized a  extensive literatures describe both of these and it is beyond the scope of this article to do more than provide a brief outline  for a more recent overview see  for an example of the cognitive approach that has enjoyed considerable influence among library practitioners see   however as bernd frohmann points out in this article talja conflates several different kinds of discourse analysis that employed by foucault brenda dervin and conversation analysis foucault emphasis by contrast to the others frohmann argues is on institutionalized social practicesthe focus also urged in this article  p  n  emphasis added
information literacy  privileging of agency over structure in her earlier formulations dervin wrote that the sense making approach both mandates attention to the term nformation as inherently a structural term in which information is typically used to describe the observings of experts and simultaneously claims that there are myriad ways that human beings have individually and collectively verbed their words in adaptation response resistance creativity challenge and invention in this formulation an information user is an actor who is an nformation expert and theorist  p  still working within the broad field of lis elfreda a chatmnan pioneered the use of ethnographic fieldwork to explore the small worlds and everyday lives of groups of less affluent information users who included women retirement home residents and janitorial staff on a college campus while studying women at a maximum security prison chatman developed her concept of life in the rounda life lived with a tolerable degree of exactitude in the sense that as long as the prisoners sense that most events occurring can be taken for granted and that they can approach their daily activities moving along a life in a routine predictable way they do not question the dimension of security in their lives like the discourse analysts chatman emphasized the importance of the collective as opposed to the individual construction of information use it is the collective view that leads to understanding the workings of a small world  p    the second track consists of the literature on reading produced by print culture scholars in history literary criticism and cultural studies as well as lis in addition to incorporating nonutilitarian concepts such as for example pleasure and play into their analyses print culture scholars talk of readerly appropriation and resistance thus providing room for the exercise of individual choice and portraying nonelite readers as possessing agency rather than as passive and even manipulated argues michel de certeau reading is    situated at the point where social stratification class relationships and poetic operations the practitioner constructions of a text intersect a social hierarchization seeks to make the reader conform to the nformation distributed by an elite or semi elite reading operations manipulate the reader by insinuating their inventiveness into the cracks in a cultural orthodoxy according to de certeau the act of reading provides readers with the opportunity to evade being shapedformedby elite cultural products  p  these two tracks are parallel in the sense that although they have apparently never crossed they have both tried to balance research attention to information texts with attention toward users readers both represent ideas theories and methods that are evolving
 the library quarterly through time as their proponents struggle to reconcile tensions inherent in the structureagency dilemma but both also have the potential to provide lis practitioners with insights language and a body of research on which to draw in devising information literacy practices that situate all information users not just scholars at the center of processes of information production and recontextualization thus hybridizing the identity of consumer as producer and producer as consumer the pedagogy of reading and the etymology of literacy the concept of the active reader was not foreign to cultural authorities of the eighteenth century who recognized that teaching people to read carried its own dangers no guarantee could assure that nonelite readers would use their opportunities in ways that the elites deemed proper they might for instance read the encyclopdie and even when confronted with officially sanctioned materials readers could produce their own interpretations irrespective of authorial or producer intent interpretations that could defy subvert or resist the dominant order believed even more dangerous was the ability to write a perception that produced systematic discrimination against whole groups of people lacking the qualifications of the cultural elite as e jennifer monaghan has shown american girls and boys in the early colonial period both learned to read but few girls were taught to write franc ois furet andjacques ozouf have demonstrated similar gender discrimination in nineteenth century france some states of the antebellum south outlawed slave literacy   thus from their beginnings over two centuries ago institutional arrangements for learning to read attempted to control who had access to what and for what purposes pitting a procrustean against a promethean ideology of reading nevertheless control was only ever partial some women did learn to write and more succeeded in gaining access to printed materials considered unsuitable for female readers slaves too exercised courage and ingenuity in acquiring the forbidden skills and using them to subvert the official order sometimes literally to gain their freedom although the word literate in the sense of an individual accomplishment has a long history reaching back to the middle ages the first recorded use of the word literacy according to the oxford english dictionary occurred in  when an education journal article declared that massachusetts is the first state in the union in literacy in its native population this innovative use of literacy to describe a demographic constructpopulationis instructive over the
information literacy  course of the nineteenth century as a concomitant to industrialization urbanization and the growth of the nation state governments became involved in a wide range of human activities one of the techniques developed to manage their activities was the collection and manipulation of statistical data taxation military service and in the united states political representation depended on the use of newly invented quantitative tools the most essential being the population census literacy then was invented as a term to describe and measure the population ability to read and write as a massitself another term that came into common use in the nineteenth century usually with derogatory connotations harvey j graff has described how in north america nineteenthand twentieth century mass literacy policies and practices developed around and perpetuated a taken for granted stratification based on social class  carl f kaestle too has pointed out the stratified nature of twentieth century american pedagogical practice that provides the majority of high school students with just enough knowledge of literature to value high culture products like shakespeare but not enough fully to participate in high culture activities as producers thus reproducing a hierarchical form of literacy  literacy and information then share a heritage of cultural and social control as well as of freedom and self expression a heritage that has the potential to be transmitted to and through information literacy as is well recognized new informational genres digital catalogs web pages e mail messages and the like present the lis community with a new version of an old problem not only are they hard to control through traditional bibliographic technical systems but they are hard to read in terms of their legitimacy whereas decontextualized print materials have an overt symbolic history for example they bear author and publisher names we have learned to recognize and may have impressive bindings and a traceable provenance which together boost the reader confidence in their authority digital genres lack this depth of signification information literacy can be construed in part as a techno administrative effort to solve the problem of bibliographic control and legitimacy with respect to digital genres a glance at a typical library web page that seeks to instruct users in methods of evaluating internet materials confirms that librarians try to replicate the standards of authority of the print world in its electronic counterpart information literacy represents this as seeking quality or dependability by  indeed the very term statistics derived from the notion of the state statisticians developed their professional practices and sold them to emerging state bureaucracies   for an elaboration of this argument and its application to the theory and methodology in the history of reading see 
 the library quarterly pointing to traditional standards of judgment the institutional affiliation of the web site author or the presence and type class of journal and so on of citations but at the same time institutional practices of information literacy have the effect of reestablishing relations of authority and authenticity that developed over three centuries for the print production of commodified information in other words they attempt to reproduce the social dimensions the social relations of the print world and impose them on the electronic world this is no easy task electronic publishing on the internet is a relatively open system in particular the world wide web was designed as a medium in which everybody can publish costs of publication and distribution on the web are low individuals with no institutional affiliation can threaten the monopoly position of those accustomed to control information production and distribution by publishing alternative content as well as alternative modes of presentation contested standards of decency and issues of security ensure that along with commercial publishers and scholarly communities state officials join the struggle for control we certainly need a structure that will avoid those two catastrophes the global uniform mcdonalds monoculture and the isolated heaven gate cults that understand only themselves writes tim berners lee i feel that to deliberately build a society incrementally using the best ideas we have is our duty and will also be the most fun we are slowly learning the value of decentralized diverse systems and of mutual respect and tolerance  p  a challenge for librarians then is to contribute through their information literacy practices to berners lee vision of an open communications system not only in technological but also in social and cultural terms and to steer a course between the scylla of chaos and charybdis of conformity one danger is that information literacy will take its cue only from the tradition of the decontextualized informational genres guidelines for the evaluation of internet resources are typically and perhaps of necessity themselves decontextualized they display little concern with actual content consider for example the page posted by the university of wisconsin madison libraries under the heading checklist for evaluating web sitesa particularly thoughtful and well designed example of a common phenomenon  the page lists questions under the following six headings what who where why how and when the questions posed are models of clarity clearly the librarians who authored the page worked hard to avoid jargon and obscurantism one particularly cogent question asks why is this site on the web and how does it affect the information students are advised to determine the purpose of the site advocacy or oapbox
information literacy  tries to persuade informational often multiple viewpoints and references business or marketing tries to sell entertainment although many of the questions and most of the headings in the checklist could be applied with equal relevance to print materials it is unlikely that students would have to be warned that they would have to sort out advertising matter from the text proper with respect to most of the printed materials on the library shelves similarly they would not expect to be told how physically to navigate the print materials although some such instruction would not necessarily come amiss most but not all of the page is based on traditional standards of evaluation in lis the sort of thing that librarians have been doing on behalf of patrons for over a century only now patrons have to learn to do it for themselves so what is the problem if these techniques of selection and evaluation have worked over the decades for librarians why should librarians not simply pass these techniques on to the general public at one level of course there is no problem none of us would wish to lay ourselves open to accusations of restrictive practice however traditional selection of library print materials was never merely a matter of the routine application of a handful of principles collection development and subject bibliography require an intimate knowledge of the content that is being evaluated as well as the context of its production based on an expertise scholarly in the case of academic materials often acquired over many years high quality bibliography requires research that in turn requires time diverse sources of material sophisticated theoretical understanding and access to if not membership of a relevant interpretive community although a techno administrative understanding of library reference materials many see no further than their structural commodified container like shape a more critical understanding recognizes not only the abstract principles underlying their structure but the contingent historical features of their journey onto the library shelves these historical features include not only the authors official institutional affiliations and title if any but their position in the interpretive community for whom they act as a voice other writers who have had an influence on their careers those with whom they have crossed swords the ways in which their views have changed over time they include knowledge of the publishing and reviewing processes that will flesh out the roles of editors translators and the writers of review articles in a variety of journals that  interpretive community is stanley fish term fish argues that judgments of informed readers are socially constructed and dependent upon the shared assumptions of the social groups to which they belong 
 the library quarterly doubtless exercise different review policies the library own acquisitions and collection policies and practices will themselves have played a part in the book journey not only the formal institutional policies that may be set out in black and white but also the personal interests and preferences of the bibliographers the constraints or otherwise of blanket and standing orders and the trade practices and policies of the jobbing firms with whom the library holds contracts those with such knowledge also understand that in terms of the production of knowledge the library shelf is not the end of the journey even for the most decontextualized reference materials they recognize that the recontextualizing process does not only take place in one direction what is the end product of one scholar work an encyclopedia article for instance may contribute to the initial stages of another the two traditional core library practices bibliographic control and reference both contribute to this process of discourse synthesis the decisions that indexers catalogers and classifiers make in providing intellectual access to the contents of books and articles through subject headings and index terms and physically or virtually allocating works to particular areas of the library collection contribute to the way in which researchers think and along with other types of reference practice information literacy itself may help to construct or define a discourse community the process of knowledge formation is intertwined with the formation and re formation of discourse communities a process that takes place through its social dimensions as mcinnis points out these social dimensions consist of the qualities of craftsmanship and the community affiliations that inhere in the work of scholars  p  scholarly discussions of discourse synthesis tend to revolve around one particular segment of the knowledge community other scholars but clearly discourse synthesis is a phenomenon that occurs in any discourse community whether as in the case of scholars relatively powerful or more marginalized as in the case of say an immigrant community for marginalized groups it has not historically been published reference works produced by well established publishing houses that have facilitated the synthesis of their discourse rather such groups have relied on more ephemeral materials such as ethnic newspapers and other local community publications as a growing number of lis commentators have argued even some public libraries with a mission  geoffrey c bowker and susan leigh star have provided a stimulating empirical analysis of the role of invisibility in the processes by which classification sorts out social relations and activities while wayne a wiegand has discussed the contextual influences that helped shape melvil dewey decisions on the classification structure  
information literacy  to serve as a center for community information have in the past done a poor job of collecting the publications of even quite sizable ethnic groups in their areas a considerable literature points to a tradition of collection management practices that has led historically to a systematic underrepresentation in library collections of materials of other groups including gay and lesbian materials radical publications of the left and the right african americans and women promoting a promethean practice traditional collection management practices then have served marginalized groups relatively poorly in providing library based access to their publications but the web with its cheap production and distribution technology can supposedly level the playing field and provide universal access to materials that previously circulated only within small communities and what will information literacy contribute to this process of opening up access the challenge is for lis community to find a way of matching the creative and unfettered character of web technology as a publishing device to open up people access to alternative web based publications rather than lay them on a one size fitsall procrustean bed a prerequisite for developing a promethean information literacy practice is paying critical attention to language use while the procrustean pressures on the synthetic information literacy are powerful they are not overwhelming and neither do the separate words information and literacy necessarily carry pessimistic connotations at the level of populations an increased spending on public education that leads to higher literacy rates for example can correlate with better material conditions that substantially improve the daily existence of millions and for individuals access to print or electronic reading materials to informationcan indeed transform the course of lives but although library professionals and educators prefer to envision a society in which information literacy plays a positive role in enhancing the quality of public engagement we are hampered in our search for a more critical discourse by a tradition in lis that uses managerial language as a matter of course and that pays almost exclusive attention to technical and administrative issues this selective tradi tireless in bringing alternative publications to the attention of the lis community have been james p danky and sanford berman whose biennial anthology alternative librayy literature has provided a thought provoking collection of critical writings since  see in particular 
 the library quarterly tion has political consequences when we restrict ourselves to an instrumental means end range of concerns and languagepurposiverational thinking injfirgen habermas terms we exclude ourselves from the option of questioning the value of what we do we surrender the moral and political implications of our professional practices to groups outside the profession who are neither shy nor reluctant to press their own agendas   so perhaps the lis community should follow its own advice and engage in some serious critical thinking and analysis that raises specific and searching questions at the societal level where the unit of analysis is neither the organization as in managerial analysis nor the individual as in pluralist analysis but society itself   the process of establishing information literacy in the educational curriculum at all levels parallels its incorporation into official discourse conferring a stamp of authority and legitimacy on the term a commonplace and uncritical explanation for this acceptance goes thus the information industries began the transformation of the production and delivery of information in the s and s with the growth of commercially available databases and the initial phases of networked information technology however it was computer miniaturization and a fall in software and hardware prices that brought digital technology within the reach of ordinary citizens from the s onward the most startling result has been the spread of the internet bringing e mail and the world wide web the most familiar of internet functions within the reach of everyone or at least of affluent members of industrialized countries but the argument goes the spread and transformation of technology has not been matched by a spread and transformation of end user skill just as in the nineteenth century technological changes in the production of print on paper in conjunction with universal schooling made possible the spread of books newspapers and magazines so the spread of digital technology in the late twentieth century now requires an investment in universal digital education furthermore it is not enough to be familiar with the basic practical techniques of computer manipulation information now appears in new and different forms and in huge quantities in order to manage this unfamiliar flood individuals need sifting evaluating and synthesizing skills knowledge management is the term that describes the most successful use of such skills information literacy is a step on the road to reaching this acme and is a rational response to changed circumstances in the world out there this standard explanation framed as it is in naturalistic language masks the contested character of the struggle to define information
information literacy  literacy and to claim it as a field of expertise as the standard explanation shields the lis community from the shifting power relations involved in the establishment and institutionalization of information literacy it also prevents us from articulating what should be the most important issue that of our moral and political values rather than focusing only on negotiating some essentialist concept of the term and on the best techniques for transmitting the agreed upon skills we should also be debating the issue of what fundamentally we are trying to do when we engage in information literacy practices however defined such a challenge requires us to ask why as well as how and to draw on scholarship not only in lis but also in education epistemology ethics politics and social theory to ask questions like what is information literacy for and who is it for in what social and institutional circumstances does it take place what consequences does information literacy have for the distribution of social and cultural goods in society as a whole furthermore the analysis should recognize that socially and historically constituted power relations based on for example class race gender and age mediate thought and definitions of knowledge  in thinking about knowledge the critical analyst first and foremost thinks relationally asking how knowledge is defined by whom and for whom and how these processes contribute to the reproduction mediation or transformation of power relations  thus a critical question about information literacy is how does the institutionalization of information literacy and the development of information literacy as a natural category reproduce mediate or transform power relationships critical analysis then focuses on values always ideologically inscribed and inseparable from fact as philip agre puts it critical analysis quickly becomes lost unless it is organized and guided by an affirmative moral purpose  critical research draws attention to structural and cultural levels of explanation to the things that happen through our actions but that exist beneath our conscious awareness  p xii language plays a key part in the construction of conscious and unconscious awareness what language do we use to describe and discuss information literacy on what concepts do we draw to explain and justify this movement who is speaking in favor of information literacy in what terms and on whose behalf thus critical analysis aims to denaturalize the natural and to call into question the taken for granted this is not simply a matter of intellectual curiosity rather critical anal this standard explanation is rooted in technological determinism  pp  
 the library quarterly ysis takes as its aim the democratization of social political economic and cultural relations it has an emancipatory aim critically scrutinizing our language use also allows us to pay greater attention to information content and context including production recontextualization and use who produces what print and electronic publications and for whom which institutions corporations and individuals are supporting publishing in terms of financial and political support who takes part in the processes of information decontextualization relocation and recontextualization librarians and lis educators also need to pose these questions within the framework of their information literacy courses some programs have already adopted this approach a pioneer is the library of the minneapolis community and technical college mctc whose information literacy course for incoming freshmen starts with a lesson on the production of knowledge and includes a segment on information politics students learn for example that just because knowledge is produced and published does not mean that it will be widely distributed it is no accident that under the guidance of librarian thomas eland the mctc library also focuses on collecting alternative press materials  we can also learn from research streams in lis and print culture history that treat information use and users or texts and readers not as groups to be manipulated and re formed but as discourse communities and communities of practice perhaps we could contemplate moving from a standardized to a more localized sense of information use as active production and consumption just as writing can be seen as an active and powerful form of reading as cultural authorities of the eighteenth century well understood so information production is something that we are all capable of and in fact all carry out it is an lis truism after all that people prefer to obtain what information they need from friends and family before turning to more standardized and commodified information products just how nonelite groups produce and disseminate information is not well understood in lis yet unless we make an effort to find out and then to make use of this understanding in shaping what we mean and how we practice information literacy we will fail to enlist nonelite consumers as producers of information in processes of production and recontextualization to achieve these goals librarians need to rethink what ross todd has called the one size fits all approach to information literacy todd suggests that librarians collaborate with other agencies who are providing information to various community groups to develop specialized tailored information literacy programs for the community based on real needs drug information agencies business organizations taking on knowledge management organizations dealing with a range
information literacy  of social concerns or social groups may benefit from the information literacy expertise of librarians  and such collaborations may facilitate the initiation of alternative conceptions of information literacy and alternative pathways to its development particularly in the social arena  and todd own research into the use of heroin information by a small group of teenage girls illustrates the concept of consumersas producers the girls he concluded were not passive robot like processors of information merely absorbing information indiscriminately  but were active creators of knowledge manipulating information selectively and creatively to develop their revised pictures  p  reference librarians too might rethink how their expert professional practices can contribute to a promethean vision james elmborg contends that academic library reference desk procedure typically emphasizes the librarian expertise in ways that are unhealthy for the learner who needs to participate in every decision in order to learn to be independent unfortunately elmborg argues many librarians today still consider their knowledge the source of their professional power he recommends especially that librarians describe in the scholarly literature what really happens in the messy process of research rather than what we think hould happen and work to develop a vocabulary for discussing the reference desk as a teaching activity  pp   addressing similar issues in cataloging and classification that other core practice in lis hope olson argues that the hierarchically based dewey decimal classification ddc system typically follows the liberal approach of instituting equality or sameness more often than it represents diversity  p  as a result groups at the top of the hierarchy will always be gathered together but groups lower down the hierarchy will be dispersed systematically privileging some while marginalizing others  pp   olson remedy is to search for permeable systems even though this means that librarians may have to relinquish control instead of possessing this power exclusively she points out we who are on the inside of the information structures must create holes in our structures through while the power can leak out a process that requires an active stance on the part of librarians and library users  pp   although adherence to enlightenment values may have gone out of fashion in the postmodern world of the s perhaps it is time for lis professionals to acknowledge again the value of their modernist and humanist inheritance this involves trolling back past the scientistic and technocratic influences of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries influences that continue to dominate the field to foreground an eighteenth century value for information as represent
 the library quarterly ing an ongoing conversation about what counts as knowledge at the same time twenty first century multicultural values remind us that we also need to go beyond the top down enlightenment model in which books and journals were necessarily produced by an educated feweuropean white males to a man as a modest start then we might consider the following components of a critical approach to information literacy first our information literacy courses should highlight in addition to the tools and skills metaphor the importance of learning about context and content in understanding how information works second we need to be both explicit about the moral and political commitment to flattening rather than reinforcing current information and literacy hierarchies third we need to recognize that information access is notjust about information consumerism but also about individuals and groups of people actively shaping their world as knowledge producers in a way that renders the consumer producer dichotomy irrelevant and finally we need also to come to terms with the fact that freedom and control perpetually vie with one another in lis especially in the arena of information literacy indeed we should take comfort in the recognition that as long as the tension holds both approaches have much to offer just so long that neither wins outright references  ayers william doing philosophy maxine greene and the pedagogy of possibility in a light in dark times maxine greene and the unfinished conversation edited by william ayers and janet l miller pp   new york teachers college press   bruce christine the seven faces of information literacy adelaide auslib   marcum james w rethinking information literacy libraty quarterly  january     american library association presidential committee on information literacy final report chicago ala   stoffle carlaj literacy  for the digital age amercan libraries  november     callison daniel critical thinking school library media activities monthly  november     mcinnis raymond g introduction defining discourse synthesis social epistemology  no      snavely loanne and cooper natasha the information literacy debate journal of academic librarianship  january     mission statement of the university libraries at the university of iowa available at httpwwwlibuiowaeduinstructionmissionhtml last accessed january    loomis abigail and konrad lee designing and implementing clue an interactive multimedia instructional program in linda shirato and elizabeth r bucciarelli theory
