comparison of the publishing patterns between men and women phds in librarianship christine a korytnykl previous research examining librarians publishing patterns has established the significance of published research for personal advancement studies have found however that in comparison with male librarians female librarians tend to publish in disproportionately small numbers one rationale offered for this discrepancy is that men receive the phd more frequently than do women doctorate holding librarians have been isolated as the most prolific writers this study tests the hypothesis that men and women exhibit similar publishing patterns if education is held constant at the doctoral level the population studied is limited to a random sample of library science phds who received their degrees between  and  a list of each person publications was compiled for the five year period following receipt of the phd the citations are classified by gender occupation and type of publication and authorship on the basis of this study the hypothesis that men and women will exhibit similar publishing patterns cannot be rejected the difference in the number of citations per person for equal numbers of men and women is insignificant differences between men and women when comparing type of publication type of authorship or quality of articles are also insignificant there is however a significant difference between the number of unpublished women and the number of unpublished men almost three times more women than men have no citations listed in library literature the hypothesis can be rejected when comparing male and female educators the difference between mean number of citations per person as well as the difference between nonpublishing male and female educators is highly significant male educators publish almost twice as many works as do women female educators are almost six times as likely as male educators to have published nothing introduction women status in librarianship is a growing concern among both male and female librarians studies document inequalities between men and   glendale drive tonawanda new york  library quarterly vol  no  pp   k  by the university of chicago all rights reserved      
comparison of publishing patterns  women particularly when comparing measures of success salary position prestige equally disturbing are studies that demonstrate women relatively low productivity for example by comparison with male librarians female librarians tend to publish in disproportionately small numbers although many variables may be responsible for this discrepancy little research has been conducted to determine the exact factors that inhibit or encourage publishing among librarians publication patterns of librarians require examination because studies have shown that high publication rates are correlated with advancement in the field and prestige among colleagues these studies also indicate that male librarians hold more high level administrative posts command larger salaries and enjoy more status than female librarians one partial explanation is that men publish a notably larger amount than women this may occur because the most prolific writers are those who hold the doctorate degree and until   more men than women were receiving phds in librarianship  p  female librarians therefore are less prepared to do research and publish if gender difference in education is the sole or major reason for gender difference in the number of publications then the publishing difference should disappear or be minimized if education is held constant at the phd the major hypothesis of this study is that when publishing histories of men and women holding library school doctorates are examined they will be similar with regard to quantity and type previous research harvey was the first to isolate publishing as a characteristic of highly placed librarians he correlated research with advancement and prestige upwardly mobile librarians were the most likely to have published books and articles eighty percent of academic library heads and  percent of public library heads had published in contrast  percent of academic librarians and  percent of public librarians holding low level positions had published harvey discovered further that most of the top positions were held by prolific authors  p  masse bloomfield  study was the first to describe both the amount published in librarianship and the author characteristics examining the number of citations per person in the  volume of library literature he found that the average library science phd published  items prior to completion of the doctorate one item per year thereafter and  items total the median number of publications was eight all citations regardless of type or authorship were assumed to have equal value gender of author was not taken into consideration
 the library quarterly journal articles were the most popular format of expression and monographs the least popular although the phds averaged more than one book each bloomfield concluded that the number of a librarian publications increased with possession of the doctorate  pp    in  bloomfield updated his previous study of publishing characteristics of librarians again using library literature as a source for citations and assigning equal value to each citation doctorate holders continued to be the most prolific writers among librarians in comparison with the earlier group post  phds published only  items prior to attainment of the doctorate with the median number of five items after receiving the degree this lower value can be attributed to the shorter time span of the second study bloomfield found that both the  and the  groups of library science doctoral candidates tended to be mature experienced publishers and concluded that somehow the selection of doctoral candidates separates those who write from those who do not nearly everyone  percent or more of the doctorates produced an item that was cited in library literature bloomfield further related writing to professional achievement he maintained that there was a high chance that the person who is a top ranking administrator or educator will write or conduct research  p  watson described research and publishing as certainly one of the most important   indexes for evaluating librarians accomplishments  p  her sample included only librarians from the ten largest public and private academic libraries that maintain composite publication lists for staff members with the exception of in house publications all other types of citations were tabulated three variables affecting publication patterns were identified the first was professional maturity librarians who have been practicing the longest tend to have the largest number of publications the second was job description watson found a high correlation between publishing and each of the following characteristics administrative responsibility subject specialization technical expertise the third factor was education sixty percent of librarianauthors have a second master a doctorate or another higher degree the olsgaard study first attempted to identify a bias in publication trends on the basis of the author sex occupation or geographic location ten years of author statistics from publications in college and research libraries crl library journal lj library quarterly lq library trends lt and rq were compared to normal distribution figures for the entire population of librarians and library school faculty members these journals were chosen because they met certain criteria established by the researchers and they represent a broad base of interests although women constitute  percent of the population of librarians the highest percentage of females among librarian authors was

 the library quarterly swisher and du mont questioned why women did not obtain top administrative posts sex was one of the variables examined as were external factors such as selective recruitment general stereotypes and lack of mentors they found two primary reasons for women lack of success first women have a lower educational level than men sixty six percent of library science phds are men while only  percent are women second men and women publish at different rates the real discrepancy was in article production  percent of men but only  percent of women were authors of articles  pp   previous research examining librarians publishing patterns has established a relationship between publication and professional advancement analysis of the characteristics of publishing librarians has determined that men publish more than women these studies have also isolated education as an important indicator of a librarian tendency to publish the present study however will compare an equal number of men and women phds to determine the extent to which education is correlated with publication if the hypothesis is rejected and it is proven that men and women who have the same educational level continue to exhibit different levels of publishing then other variables affecting publishing must be examined by future investigators if the hypothesis is found to be correct and men and women phds show similar publishing output then it can be predicted that as women continue to earn doctorates in equal or greater numbers publishing differences will be reduced methodology this comparison of the effect of education on the publishing patterns of men and women is limited to a sample drawn from the population of library science phds people holding this degree account for  percent of all authors of the literature of library science perhaps because doctorate level training provides intensive preparation for research this population is also assumed to be relatively homogeneous in terms of motivation and commitment to the field a list of people who completed their library science phds between  and  was generated using american doctoral dissertations this source lists all dissertations accepted by american and canadian universities each entry was numbered and a random sample of thirty men and thirty women was drawn when the sex of a person could not be determined from the name the institution granting the degree was contacted any entry whose sex still could not be determined was discarded a list of each entry publications for the five year period following

 the library quarterly external obstacles discriminatory hiring practices difficulty in obtaining research funds editorial bias lack of encouragement failure to gain the academic rewards and recognition men normally achieve such as tenure and promotions may discourage women from publishing for instance statistics gathered by the association for library and information science education reveal that in   women held  percent of the full time faculty positions in ala accredited library schools but only  percent of the associate professorships  percent of the full professorships  percent of the deanships  p f  and  percent of the tenured appointments  p f  at all ranks women mean and median salaries were substantially lower than men on the other hand considerably lower percentages of women than men held earned doctorates  p f a difference that may soon disappear three possible explanations for women lack of publications are explored in this study the first is type of publication authorship of longer more substantial works such as monographs take more time and energy and may therefore lower the number of citations for an individual the second possibility is type of employment an administrator responsibilities may prevent the publication of as many works as a library school faculty member who is required to publish in order to earn tenure and usually has a more flexible schedule the third reason may lie with the quality of publications an article in a refereed journal is generally more scholarly in nature and requires more research than an article published by a nonrefereed journal although women publish quantitatively fewer articles than men the quality of women articles may be higher type of publication and authorship to determine which type of publication is most commonly written by men and by women five categories were identified monograph article chapter occasional paper and pamphlet the contrast between the large number of citations to articles and the small number of citations to all other publication categories reflects the results bloomfield  first described men however still had more citations in every category with the exception of pamphlets this breakdown also highlights a general lack of citations to monographs by both men and women the difference between bloomfield findings and the results of this study can probably be explained by the difference in time frames bloomfield studied more than thirty years of data this study is limited to a ten year period although both men and women had an equal number of citations to monographs two of the women citations were to jointly edited directories further research is needed to determine exact reasons for this gap in the literature are funds to support the writing of longer
comparison of publishing patterns  works of scholarship unavailable to women do their other professional obligations take precedence over the writing of monographs type of authorship is broken down into four categories sole author sole editorcompiler joint author joint editorcompiler the results show that most authors work individually rather than on a team men however tend to publish articles with colleagues at three times the rate of women it is in the category of the jointly authored article that men excel boosting their quantitative output above women level this trend suggests that women suffer from professional isolation they may not be included as often on research teams or communicate as effectively with colleagues through professional networks further investigation is needed to determine whether men copublish exclusively with other men or with women as well a t test revealed the difference between the mean number of jointly authored works between men and women to be insignificant t   the difference between the number of men and the number of women who are authors of jointly published articles is also insignificant t   future researchers need to study professional collegiality and its effect on professional advancement type of employment examination of the career paths women choose may provide another explanation for the lower publishing rates of women  the ala membership directory and the directory of library school faculty members compiled annually by the association of american library schools now the association for library and information science were consulted to find the job title that each member of the sample had in the third year after completion of the phd based on these titles each person was classified as an educator member of a library school faculty or as a professional practicing librarian or administrator whose primary responsibilities exclude teaching five men and three women were not listed in either directory and were therefore excluded from this part of the study it is expected that educators are under more pressure to publish particularly those who have just begun their academic careers and are trying to become tenured if more men tend to become educators and more women become professionals then men would have more citations the comparison of male educators with female educators however discounts the above hypothesis tables  and  educators who are male published  items per person with a median of four women averaged only  items their median is one a t test showed the difference in the mean numbers of publications of men and women educators to be significant the confidence interval was approximately  percent t   in addition women educators with no citations  percent

comparison of publishing patterns  far outnumber the nonpublished men  percent a t test revealed this difference to be highly significant t   although this study did not survey those sampled to determine motivations for publishing several explanations are possible for the discrepancy in citation totals the first regards type of institution women may prefer to work at schools that emphasize teaching at the expense of research a second reason may be inequality in the distribution of job responsibility heavy teaching or advising loads and administrative duties would prevent women from conducting research a third factor may be that women are discouraged from perceiving library school faculty positions as permanent hiring for tenure track positions may be biased in favor of men or women may be more likely to be denied tenure in either case lack of incentive for publishing would stifle the motivation to publish male professionals constitute the only group of men that publishes at a slightly lower rate than the same category of women these men average  citations per person with a median of two women professionals however average  citations per person their median is only  indicating that some very prolific women boost the average results of a t test show the difference in the mean number of citations between men and women professionals to be insignificant t   a t test reveals the difference in the numbers of nonpublished men and women professionals also to be insignificant t   the low median number of citations for professional women constitutes further evidence of professional segregation if women are discouraged from pursuing careers as library school educators they may instead choose professional positions despite their interests in research and their abilities to publish consequently the group of professional women will contain exceptional members whose high rate of publication skews the mean toward a high value women may also feel that in order to compete successfully for top level administrative posts their record of productivity must exceed that of their male colleagues in addition no professional woman has any jointly authored articles which indicates that professional isolation among these women may be particularly severe quality of publications a comparison of the quality of the articles written by library science phds using journal selection methods as a measure reveals no difference between men and women approximately one third of all articles were published in refereed journals table  a t test showed no significant difference t   therefore further research is necessary to determine whether a real difference does exist in the quality of articles
