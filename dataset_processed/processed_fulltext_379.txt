preservation of rare books and manuscripts in the huntington library n october of the year i the short lived periodical known as the bibliographer published an essay entitled of bibliophilism and the preservation of books by henry french later identified as the great collector robert hoe in this article the author makes the unqualified statement that palatial fireproof buildings with imposing facades monumental staircases and lofty halls and reading rooms elaborate and learned classifications and systems of catalogues with ingenious machinery for the almost automatic delivery of books to readers however perfect and efficient furnish no guarantee for the proper care of literary treasures perhaps because of the relatively high proportion of unique and rare material in the huntington collections we have given a great deal of time and thought to the preservation of rare books and manuscripts the belief that not only the present generation but generations for centuries to come will need to use these materials has caused us to develop a somewhat more extended idea of actual library obligations than the average research institution the creation of treasure rooms in several large public and university libraries during recent years shows a definite trend toward conservation for posterity making it clear that librarians in research institutions are becoming definitely receptive to ideas other than those mainly governing the purchase and circulation of books i had at first planned to touch more generally on the broad subject of the preservation of books and manuscripts on the possibilities of the photostat and other methods of photographic reproduction for the purpose of conserving original material on the restricted use of certain rarities and on many i a paper read before the large college and reference libraries section of the american library association new orleans april s   
 the library quarterly other points of possible interest to a group of librarians who have or may some day have the responsibility of a rare collection but a letter received some time ago from dr t j briggs of the united states bureau of standards seemed to indicate that a paper confined chiefly to methods of exterminating bookworms would be more timely in answer to my inquiry dr briggs said we have not made any experiments upon bookworm extermination we have been told that there is much difficulty with bookworms in libraries at new orleans i feel that under the circumstances new orleans should benefit from the experience of the huntington library in exterminating bookworms or more specifically the sitodrepa panicea as the species which infested our stacks is known in the united states and consequently i shall devote most of my time to that subject in the late spring of i much to our concern signs of bookworm activity in the rare book stack were noticed some two hundred volumes having been recently damaged in our initial efforts to combat these pests we naturally turned for advice to older and more experienced libraries in various parts of the world having rare collections knowing as we did that the ravages of bookworms had been going on for centuries and thinking that the solution must already have been found in this we were sorely disappointed dozens of inquiries were sent out but their answers afforded us little help a few librarians admitted that they were confronted with the same problem but confessed that they were at a loss to know how to cope with the situation scientifically some said that while they were not bothered with bookworms other book destroying insects had caused great damage others reported that their libraries were free from all insect pests and seemed a bit surprised to learn that there was a bookworm other than the human variety many remedies were suggested not a few of which were rather humorous in view of the varied diet of the sitodrepa panicea for instance it was suggested that a little fine pepper sprinkled on the shelves would have a good effect it would but the good effect would be for the bookworm not the library mr f h chittenden whose short chapter on the sitodrepa panicca

 the library quarterly monsignor tisserant in later correspondence intimated that they are not satisfied with their attempt to solve their bookworm problem and at the present time are seriously considering the installation of an exterminator similar to the one designed for the huntington library but i am getting ahead of my story libraries in england were unanimous in their statements that they were free from bookworms yet our infestation could be directly traced to a shipment of books received from that country about eight or nine years ago a great number of these books had been rebacked but now and then worm holes appeared in the new leather indicating that the eggs at least and probably some of the larvae had not been dislodged while the books were being rebound the united states bureau of entomology reported that they had never made a thorough study of insects affecting books we have they said fumigated libraries with h ydrocyanic acid gas but primarily for the destruction of such external feeding pests as cockroaches and silverfish and such nuisances as bedbugs while the bureau of standards stated that they had made no experiments upon bookworm extermination they sent us a list of references which included c houlbert les insectes ennemis des livres paris i and arturo scarone el libro y sus enemigos montevideo iitwo of the most authoritative books concerned solely with insect enemies of books from these two sources we learned much about the habits of bookworms if you will pardon my translation from houlbert work i should like to quote what he has to say about the anobium or sitodrepa paniceum which he says is called vrillette du pain in france brodkaifer in germany and drug store beetle in the united states honor to whom honor is due one can certainly consider this insect the most dangerous to our books and libraries at the same time it is one of the most prevalent and it is perhaps not exaggerated to say that cight tenths of the damage done in the bindings of books may be attributed to them    the female drug store beetle deposits its eggs near the surface of the binding or on the edge of the leaves choosing the most favorable spots for the evolu

 the library tuarterly dr hagen referred only to the larvae the egg chrysalis and beetle are harder to destroy to insure full success an effective fumigant should be used along with the vacuum treatment we had for some time been interested in a fumigant that had just come on the market ethylene oxide ch but because it was new we were naturally cautious and our experiments with it were more extensive than with the gases mentioned before we were considering ethylene oxide as an insecticide and carbon dioxide as a blanketing gas since the former used alone is inflammable but this meant having in the building inflammable material in some form however safe it might be as a mixture inside a fumigating chamber the problem was solved when dr arnold  beckman of the department of chemistry at the california institute of technology who had been helping us with other experiments discovered that ethylene oxide and carbon dioxide could be combined in a liquid that is neither inflammable nor explosive this new fumigant is now being marketed under the trade name of carboxide a safe and effective fumigant at last being available we designed with the aid of dr irving gleason chemical engineer for a company manufacturing vacuum equipment a fumigator five feet in diameter by ten feet long sufficiently large to accommodate five or six library trucks full of books at one time or the largest pieces of furniture tapestries and other objects of art the actual operation of the apparatus is very simple and does not require the services of a trained engineer or a fumigating expert since its installation we have fumigated all suspected volumes in the rare book stack as well as foreign shipments showing the least signs of infestation until all books in the stacks have been fumigated there is of course the possibility of re infestation but we feel that with strict vigilance and ordinary precaution our battle has been won and we hope the diet of wormsas far as the huntington library is concerned will once again be the good earth rather than priceless volumes but there is another factor in the battle against book destroying pests and here i think i may broaden the entomological reference advisedlythat of climate without realizing it

preservation of rare books  at the time and for another purpose entirely we had already created in our rare book and manuscript stacks atmospheric conditions which seem to retard the propagation of insect enemies of books librarians are powerless to prevent the use of poor paper leather etc in the manufacture of books but can do much to keep volumes of such inferior character from deteriorating unnecessarily and to bring about the general use of more lasting materials in the future dr frank p hill and mr harry m lydenberg have been of great service in facilitating the preservation of newsprint paper and in persuading a few newspapers to issue small editions on more permanent paper for deposit in certain libraries and as you know the bureau of standards under the auspices of the national research council and the carnegie corporation is carrying on extensive investigations in the whole field of conservation of records the results thus far obtained make us all conscious of the fact that custodians of books and manuscripts have long been negligent in this direction a report on the progress of experiments was written by b w scribner for the october  vol i number of the library quarterly several preliminary surveys and observations have already been published one of these concerned more directly with the subject of this paper was recently issued under the title a survey of storage conditions in libraries relative to the preservation of records after reading it i began to wonder if i shouldn have based the present paper entirely on ideal atmospheric conditions for bookstacks instead of devoting so much time to exterminating the sitodrepa panicea in this report the statement is made that no library was able to control completely the variation of temperature and relative humidity within the narrow limits considered necessary for successful preservation of records and none attempted to minimize acidic pollutions of the air the following external agents were considered to be of great consequence in dealing with the preservation of records i light particularly sunlight attacks both the paper and fibers and the sizing material producing yellowing and brittling s in bureau of standards miscellaneous publicatsions no i october 
 the library quarterly the huntington library realizing several years ago the danger of sunlight admitted through ordinary window glass took steps to avoid the hazard in the stacks moreover we carried on rather extensive experiments to determine as far as possible the caliber of the rays penetrating into the various rooms from both natural and artificial light and even investigated the advantages of certain types of window glass and electric lamps as a result we installed actinic glass in the windows on the south side of the new reference room and blocked up those in the main exhibition room at the present time experiments are being conducted to enable us to estimate the deteriorating influence of existing artificial lighting conditions in the stacks over a period of two or more centuries if these tests indicate that the lighting facilities are still unfavorable corrective measures will be taken  the absorption of moisture containing sulphurous and sulphuric acids resulting from the combustion of coal and other present day fuels produces marked deterioration recent tests prove that our air conditioning plant is successfully removing practically all dust acids etc from the air entering the stacks in large cities it is extremely important to guard against this constant source of trouble tests made in london over a period of twelve months indicated that deposits amounting to  tons fell on that city during the year this total included ooo tons of ammonia ooo tons of sulphite and  tons of chlorine and chlorides to say nothing of vast amounts of carbon and tar  successive changes in atmospheric temperature and relative humidity seem to exert a marked deteriorative effect the phenomenon most frequently observed being that of brittling following prolonged storage in warm dry places the authors should have added here that excessive humidity is favorable to the growth of mold elsewhere they say that temperature and humidity should be automatically regulated within relatively narrow limits and suggest a range of temperature from  to  f and of humidity from  to  per
