the development of technical services training the world of the library and the world of the mind our two questions raise an ancient dilemma the history of the teaching of the technical services goes back at least to melvil dewey at columbia in  dewey had described his proposed school of library economy at the ala convention in buffalo in  and asked for comments poole had at once obliged i think mr dewey is in error in stating that there is now no institution in this country for educating librarians i have the impression that there is an excellent one in boston known as the boston public library there is another in boston called the boston athenaeum and still another in the adjacent city of cambridge called the harvard college library    there is no training school for educating librarians like a well managed library cutter had a characteristic reply undoubtedly it is well that a librarian should have worked in a library there are some things which he will never understand unless he has but any one merely employed as an assistant in a large library is likely to be assigned to one particular department and to understand that only and even if his chief take care that he shall have variety of work he only learns the method of one establishment and as those are probably all determined upon before he goes there he only learns them by rote and unless he is unduly philosophic he never thinks of the reasons for them no one is thoroughly fit to have charge of a library who has not pursued some comparative study and learned to reason about what he does in november  j schwartz self styled poet lariat of the library journal published a poem on the new school of library economy i three little maids from school are we filled to the brim with economy  not of the house but library learnt in the library school st maid  i range my books from number one d maid  alphabetically tve begun d maid  in regular classes mine do run all  three maids from the library school

the development of technical services training school students had first to learn the library hand there was no agreement as to the relative importance of different subjects cataloging classification book selection and reference usually took about half the student time and to these subjects some schools gave two or three times as many hours of instruction as others did four to twelve weeks one eighth to one fourth of the school year was given over to field work usually known as practical work in some library or libraries with no particular attempt by the schools to make this an educational experience seven of the fifteen schools he surveyed were connected with public libraries among the williamson recommendations which dealt in some way with the teaching of the technical services we may note at least three  that the schools become integral parts of universities  that the first year of study be general and basic  that there be a distinction between professional and clerical skills and that training in clerical skills be largely eliminated and so the pendulum started to swing back the schools moved into academic settings chicago graduate library school at first eyed with suspicion gave impetus to the theoreticians particularly when the other schools began to imitate it librarianship  and along with it the technical services  became a graduate study with a number of schools even offering the doctorate laboratory work and clerical routines tended to disappear accreditation became a matter of professional pride finally perhaps most important of all came the revolution within cataloging itself departmentalism  the eye of the ant  had taken its toll to the five laws of library science we were about to add two more every book its rule every rule its book then in  appeared a d osborn famous crisis in cataloging there is nothing new in this pamphlet and there is very little that rests on concrete evidence but it came at a time when books were engulfing the world and its libraries while we spent our days multiplying rules and exceptions to rules and exceptions to exceptions there have been other better and more scholarly papers but this one crystallized what a great many people were thinking it is true that revision of the rules came to little in the  rules for entry and was only somewhat successful in the  rules for de
journal of education for librarianship scription and it is further true that the current revision for all its bright beginning faces constantly the danger of being nibbled into the image of  but the spirit of revolution was in the air and it still abides with us what is the theory behind the rule what is the reason for the practice what can be discarded humeston study showed us that in the early o teachers at least thought they were giving more attention to principles and theory and less to lab work and drill in detail today the bulletins of the accredited library schools offer a somewhat confused picture because of individual differences in combinations of material to make up a course vagaries in titles given to courses and general confusion as to just what the technical services are and where they should appear in the curriculum so the technical services curricula these bulletins offer may be described only in very broad outlines generally cataloging and classification are combined they appear in two or three  sometimes four  courses with generally only the introductory course required generally the word laboratory does not appear even in describing the introductory course but one cannot escape a sneaking suspicion that at least some of the old fashioned lab lingers on in the guise of what is now and then vaguely called practice or problems a few schools offer courses called only cataloging or only classification these are generally advanced courses and they frequently deal with special problems or special material a handful of schools eg chicago illinois syracuse and western reserve offer courses in the history andor theory of cataloging and or classification and another handful eg florida mcgill michigan western reserve offer courses dealing only with serials practically all schools have courses in selection andor acquisition of materials but generally it is impossible to tell what if anything is done with the techniques and principles of order work a number of schools have courses in documentation andor bibliography less than a dozen offer a course called technical services and often they offer this course as a sort of advanced survey to students who have already had specialized courses in cataloging and classification administration and so on some schools such as syracuse and mcgill offer a beginning course in technical services except cataloging and classification others such as peabody offer courses called technical services which are described as chiefly cataloging and classification a few schools sponsor a work study program by which the student may earn his degree in say two years while working to pay expenses in a cooperating library 
the development of technical services training two variations in the beginning course may be worth noting at columbia the beginning course is a survey of the technical services designed to develop critical understanding of practices and alternative methods at chicago beginning cataloging and classification are integrated into a four quarter course intended to give students competence to evaluate and interpret books of the major different kinds with particular reference to the basic problems of the creation organization and use by readers of book collections so much for the library schools and their curricula broadly speaking after some thirty five years devoted to the practical details of the technical services they have spent another thirty five years groping sometimes blindly toward the theory of technical services what of the textbooks which the schools have used  we have time to look at only a few f k w drury order work for libraries  parades a dreary profusion of detailed forms and intricate routines dredged out of many libraries the book was no doubt the apple of the eye of the ant margaret mann introduction to cataloging and the classification of books d ed  protests that it is not a manual of practice but at once adds that naturally some definite rulings are stated p v  the chief trouble of course is that many of the rulings are now long since out of date we have had two codes of entry and two editions of dewey and a flood of theory and controversy since the last mann susan grey akers simple library cataloging on the other hand has kept somewhat up to date with a th edition in  it is a book of straightforward instructions with no attention to theory and it calls for somewhat more detail in cataloging than may be needed in the usual small library individual teachers have tried to fill the vacuum left by mann and akers with manuals designed for their own particular needs there are some exceptions to the how to do it approach among other books john metcalfe chaotic harangues and sayers lucid treatises offer a stimulating contrast in the approach to classification in a class of its own is m f tauber technical services in libraries  it is in no sense a how to do it book instead it is a state of theart volume scholarly and encyclopedic which gives an excellent survey such a book alas is out of date the minute it is published cutter rules for a dictionary catalog th ed  was perhaps the only really good code so far as possibilities for use in instruction were concerned not merely was it a code which opened with a statement of objects to be accomplished by the catalog and then proceeded to lay down rules based on these objects for both author and 
journal of education for librarianship title entries and subject headings also with every rule where there was some possibility of question cutter gave the reasoning behind all sides of the question successive ala rules in   and  were more and more complex and in no case was the reason for the decision given even lc rules for descriptive cataloging of  although opening with a statement of principles were not always as simple as those principles would have allowed and like ala they had no discussion of individual rules seymour lubetzky current revision likewise is based on principles and somewhat more logically developed than the alalc codes but the individual rules here again have no discussion the commentary which accompanied the most recent published version was more concerned with comparison with the  rules than with theory the sears and lc lists of subject headings are simply that lists they represent only the accumulations over a period of years of what different librarians at different times for different reasons have considered good the instructions in the sears introduction and haykin book on lc subject headings simply try to erect a logical framework around the lists the same is true of classification the various editions of lc and of dewey have appeared without explanation other than what is needed to apply them and merrill code for classifiers simply tells how libraries were applying them in  and tries to offer some rationalization so in spite of the trend toward theory in the schools the textbooks remain largely how to do it manuals perhaps more important than the schools and the textbooks are the teachers in  the williamson report noted that  per cent of the library school teaching staff had no adequate experience in library work the percentage of inexperience may be higher today indeed one library school administrator has suggested that with the emergence of theory in the schools there is less need for teachers to have practical experience and that such experience may even be a disadvantage but the practicing librarian in  just as in  wants the library school to send him a graduate who can take up where the departing cataloger with twenty years experience left off recently a head cataloger remarked that she would like to hold an institute for her friends who teach in library school there is a third corner in this debate 
the development of technical services training teachers do need practical experience a lot of it but this experience is wasted if it leads them merely to turn out carbon copies of librarians already in the technical services the teacher must be a revolutionary not a preacher that whatever is is right but he cannot revolt unless he knows precisely what he is revolting against and why the melancholy fact is that the librarians are sometimes ahead of the teachers the revolt against the elaborate details of the  ala code for instance was led by librarians and first bore fruit in a library the library of congress even today many cataloging details hang on in some classrooms long after most libraries have found them useless and expensive in small libraries the librarian trained in such a class room is sometimes so wrapped up in the details of technical services that the technical services have ceased to be services because they leave no time for public service when the teacher gets his experience he spies out the land then he goes to his school and trains his band of rebels but his men like their leader must also know the lay of the land so he will begin with the basic techniques and he will stay with these techniques till they are mastered then will come theory and devastating analysis and the troops will be ready to march into the promised land i began with robert frost i close with john cotton dana f here there is a standard method of doing a thing which has been accepted and approved over a considerable period of time it is safe to assume that it is wrong or at least that it is capable of being improved it is no longer based on the intellect but has become merely habit and imitation  references  proceedings buffalo conference library journal  septoct   proceedings buffalo conference library journal  septoct   schwartz j three little maids from the library school library journal  nov   columbia college library school of library economy circular of information   p   humeston e j teaching cataloging today a survey journal of cataloging and classification     lancour harold historical development of education for librarianship in berelson b r education for librarianship university of chicago studies in library science chicago american library association  pp    ayrault margaret remarks at montreal institute i  ball sarah b reminiscences of things past special libraries  mayjune
