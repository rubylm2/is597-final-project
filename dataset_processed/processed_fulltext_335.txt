bodleian catalogs  would be difficult to say that the bodleian catalogs of  and  contain an explicit recognition of principles expressed in the twentieth century a study of the preface of the  catalog does suggest concern for some of the matters implicit in modern principles the construction of both catalogs is often compatible with these principles although the means by which the principles are carried out are at times markedly different from modern practice the bodleian printed catalogs the printed catalogs of the bodleian library precede most of the developments which mark the beginnings of modern cataloging theory and thus provide examples of early catalogs at a time in cataloging history when acceptable practice rather than the formulation of principle was being attempted the library which opened its doors to students in  was founded by sir thomas bodley who kept up an extensive correspondence with the librarian thomas james while the latter was compiling the library catalogs  manuscript versions were prepared in  and   and the printed catalog was issued one year later  this catalog reflected the organization of the library books and manuscripts entries were divided first according to the divisions faculties of the university arts theology medicine and law these four divisions were further subdivided by volume size and then alphabetically by author name for works of known authorship pseudonymous and anonymous works were entered under the key words of their titles an index at the back gathered all entry words into one sequence james next printed catalog that of   provides the most significant innovation yet in bodleian tradition the arrangement of a library catalog by alphabetical sequence of authors surnames rather than by subject a step in this direction had been taken in the   manuscript catalog which was arranged in a rough alphabetical order subdivided according to the faculties the  catalog had been preceded by an unprinted version in  which had been completed in the year of bodley death bodley an advocate of systematic organization by subject had exercised considerable control over the making of the first catalog in the preface to the  catalog james defends his departure from the precedent of the  catalog pointing out that a single alphabetical sequence has the advantage of grouping together works by the same author the catalog construction suggests an implicit distinction between the distribution of the physical volumes in the actual library and the organization of the catalog james did not eschew the idea of  this account of the early bodleian catalogs is based on the extensive study done by wheeler 
 the library quarterly locating books according to subject but felt that such access was best achieved for different subjects through separate catalogs which he continued to prepare for the entire collection even after poor health forced him to retire in  these extensive and intricately constructed bibliographic tools employed a subject classification far more complex and sophisticated than bodley four divisions by faculty the catalogs of   and   can be considered almost as one unit since the  catalog represents an extension and refinement of the practices introduced in  thomas hyde bodley librarian from  to  compiled the catalog published in  and showed himself defensive of and sensitive to the delay that had occurred in its production he devoted no small part of his preface to explaining why the catalog had taken nine years to complete it had been an immense labor he said and he lauded his own persistence in carrying out the task of compilation in the face of a variety of obstacles  p  thomas hearne who worked on the  catalog and was one of hyde detractors claimed that the actual work of examining the volumes and writing out the  catalog was done not by hyde but by emmanuel prichard the janitor and that hyde did not do much in the work besides writing the dedication and the preface  p  even if this is true hyde should nevertheless be credited with recognizing the problems and stating the principles underlying the construction of the catalog entries some of the principles expressed reflect practices already in use in the two earlier catalogs of  and  although hyde could not resist taking a few snipes at his predecessor  p ii the  catalog is a large folio volume more extensive and complex than the  quarto and introduced a number of improvements some of which are mentioned in the preface some of which are not prichard the indefatigable janitor kept up an interleaved copy of the  catalog and around the year  prepared an appendix of new material for it  p  soon after his election to the post of bodley librarian in  john hudson assigned his assistant thomas hearne the task of making corrections and additions to the catalog hearne hoped to issue these changes as his own appendix to hyde catalog   vol  p  but the work which was continued by several others eventually resulted in the two folio volumes of the  catalog the handsome format of the catalog is almost exactly that of the  version the development of an elaborate system of cross references and ascriptive notes innovations of the  catalog is even more noticeable in the new version robert fysher who was librarian at the time and had transcribed the catalog for the press reprinted hyde preface and added a brief preface of his own   p i the preface is written in latin and i have therefore paraphrased those sections which i use for my argument there is no pagination for the preface the page numbers given are my own  probably more akin to a library assistant
bodleian catalogs  three clergymen were assignecl different sections in the preparation of the next catalog wvhich appearecl in  though work had begun on it thirty years earlier a supplement was added in  bringing the completed work to four folio volumes  in format and structure some changes were made from previous editions cross references are fewer and more limited in function and authors names are listed with surname first this catalog which is mentionea here for the sake of completeness and is not further considered did not enjoy as high a reputation as the earlier bodleian catalogs no further printed catalogs were issued the decline of the bodleian in cataloging history occurred roughly at the time when the cataloging policies of the british museum and of its energetic and controversial director antony panizzi were to make cataloging a subject of public debate at hearings of a royal commission   and to usher in the beginning of modern cataloging theory method of examination with a view to ascertaining general cataloging method at a time when the formulation of principles was often no more than a documentation of particular practices this paper will make use of modern cataloging theory as reflected in the statement of principles adopted at the international conference on cataloguing principles at paris in  the paris principles of particular interest is the statement view of the functions of the catalog  p xiii one must be cautious in applying modern theory to catalogs of an earlier period students of cataloging history have been aware of this we must take care not to approach catalogues belonging to past centuries with the principles of modern cataloguing theory verona has said indicating that at the time when old printed catalogues were compiled there did not yet exist any theory of cataloguing     p j i do not of course suggest that the compilers of the early bodleian catalogs went about their work under the guidance of a clearly formulated theory of cataloging based on principles similar to modern ones rather it seem ns to me that thomas hyde statement of his objectives in compiling his  catalog as expressed in its preface and the patterns of practice evident in both of the bodleian catalogs of  and  often presage modern practices and objectives for which a theoretical basis has been formulated discussions of hyde  preface frequently focus on the most obvious points of his cataloging code but one important aspect of the preface appears to have been overlooked he goes beyond the mere provision of a list of rules and provides us with a rationale which shows the purpose of the rules and how the rules are intended to assist the reader this paper will indicate  this comment occurs in a discussion of corporate entries a concept more peculiarly modern than those to be treated in this paper

 the library quarterly time during his career  p  and that by the middle of the seventeenth century many scholars had dealt in one way or another with the problems of anonyma and pseudonyma  p  a work of particular assistance to scholars of pseudonyma and anonyma was the  syntagma of vincent placcius which contained approximately  ascriptions and identifications followed by his theatrum published posthumously in  which extended the list to  anonymous and  pseudonymous entries placcius works are cited again and again with exact page numbers in the ascriptive notes to the bodleian catalog of  but it should also be noted that the  catalog had in turn been of assistance to placcius and that hyde had alerted placcius to the existence of anonyma and pseudonyma from jesuit sources hyde claimed that he himself was preparing a list of ascriptions but it never appeared in print the compilation of the bodleian catalogs involved men of learning who had some awareness of the problems of attribution james scholarly efforts along this line had been directed to the compilation of a specific theological catalog and were not reflected in his catalogs of the bodleian libraries from hyde contact with placcius probable work on a list of pseudonyms and remarks in his preface it may be conjectured that he too recognized the problems of ascription and was equipped to deal with them hyde cautioned in his preface that it is all too easy to make the mistake of ascribing a book by one author to the name of another scholars should note that in investigating books they might diligently consider that the authors names may be written in different ways or that an author may have two completely different names he gave the example of roman popes who always took a different name after election to the pontificate  p iv in the case of the  catalog some of the decisions which led to ascriptive cross references and notes are documented in the diaries of thomas hearne who had been requested by librarian john hudson to assist with the catalog i took dr hyde catalogue in two volumes interleaved  went round the whole library  compared every book by which means i corrected many mistakes made by dr hyde  supplied all the defects by cataloguing such books as had been put up and not entered this done i consulted many books in order to recover anonymous authors by this means i retriev the names of many writers that were before entered either under the titles only of the several books or else under the initial letters of the authors  vol  p  hearne part in the compilation of the  catalog and especially those aspects which reflect a striking attention to detail can be seen in  james hyde and hearne were all noted scholars james wrote extensively in theology hyde was regius professor of hebrew and laudian professor of arabic and hearne was renowned for his historical writings
