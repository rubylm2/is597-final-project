 journal of education for library and information science review of existing research retention of students in online educational programs has been the subject of numerous reports sincc the first online classes were taught in the early s there appears to be no clear retention or attrition rate for all programs and the statistics are confounded by the number and types of programs studied perry boman care edwards  park  it has been established through studies at several colleges that attrition rates have been   to  percent higher for courses delivered online than for those delivered face to face carr  throughout the decade from  to  dropout rates for online classes and programs were reported to range between  and  percent in secondary undergraduate continuing professional and graduate courses in a wide range of disciplines angelo williams  natvig  carr  long  tyler smith  it must be recognized of course that attrition occurs among both online and face to face student populations the canadian association of graduate schools  for example reported attrition rates for graduate degree programs masters and doctoral levels to range between   and  percent regardless of how instruction was delivered reports of retention rates higher than  percent are not evident in the recent literature while there are many prescriptive recommendations how to retain online students based on best practice and survey results reporting why students stayed or left their online classes or programs few reports link a broad range or cluster of specific program attributes to higher retention rates we report here that the combined design and implementation of the online program option at the ua slis is associated with the high rate of retention the program has enjoyed and the literature strongly supports this view ua slis online program overview the ua mlis online program option was implemented beginning with the august  fall semester the aim of the online option was to provide extended geographical access to the  semesterhour program leading to the mlis for students unable to move to the tuscaloosa campus or to commute to the university extension campus in gadsden alabama the program was regarded as a natural progression from both travelling courses introduced early in the school history and two way compressed video classes delivered to remote sites in the  s and early s the faculty decided that a real time two way voice over internet protocol voip instructional delivery mode would be the online program option best suited to the prevailing ua slis culture a synchronous two way voip program was supported by the university through its college of continuing studies which has a long history of expertise in innovative educational outreach and provides advice and support that includes the financial modeling that provided for both an affordable education for students and fiscal benefit to ua slis after a year of planning and recruitment the school launched its first student cohort of  students in august  using wimba live classroom integrated into blackboard vista for web based course support primary contacts with prospective and admitted students were handled through the program director the assistant to the director a professional staff member responsible for student services at ua slis and the distance education coordinator a faculty member compensated for this parttime administrative service the online study option was designed to serve parttime adult graduate students who would complete two online courses each term over six semesters including summers to earn the degree in two calendar years given the high retention rate of the ua slis online program option what attributes of this program could be linked to this retention rate
