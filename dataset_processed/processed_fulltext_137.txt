 the library quarterly reception theory reception theory is a modern approach to literary history that examines the ways in which literary works are received by readers the examination of reception began in the s in the fields of jurisprudence theology and philosophy the application of reception theory to literary studies developed in the late s as a way to relate the three elements of aesthetic communication author work and recipient or reader critic and audience the approach is a reaction to the limitations of intrinsic literary study often known as new criticism in which a literary work is considered complete unto itself autonomous and apart from the reader reception theory is related to other rhetorical studies such as readerresponse criticism they have in common an interest in the relationship between the literary text and its reader between what is being communicated and how it is received each reader oriented approach acknowledges that literary works do not exist within a vacuum but have meaning from their interaction with readers reception study is distinguished by its greater concern with historical changes affecting the reading public than with the solitary reader literary meaning is determined over time by a series of readings constituting its history of influence the history of reception includes those literary and sociological factors that shape individual responses in a given time and place the context of reception is defined in material and ideological terms in aesthetic terms or in terms of evaluative interpretive communities that mediate between the literary product and audience horizons of expectations is the foundation of reception theory the criterion by which readers judge literary texts in any given period the horizons consist of the readers current knowledge and assumptions about literature both intrinsic and extrinsic intrinsic horizons reflect literary experience with genres conventions and themes against which a work is read and evaluated extrinsic horizons reflect the social and political conditions and norms in the larger society the intrinsic and extrinsic horizons are interdependent a literary text has a particular historical audience that responds to the work in a dialectical relationship of question and answer a text has a particular meaning for its time by the way it answers the fundamental questions of its age the questions and answers embedded in a literary work in a particular historical moment can only be understood by a later age through reconstructing the horizons of expectations of that time literary works ask and answer questions the substance of which reveals how the readers of that day viewed and understood the work to formulate an account of the reception of children books in the
