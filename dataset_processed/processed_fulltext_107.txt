ya novels gaylesbianqueer content  content analysis focusing on demographics of gaylesbian characters has revealed some interesting patterns but it leaves many questions unanswered extracting and examining the gaylesbian characters in more than ninety books by more than eighty authors published over a twenty nine year time span necessitates a decontextualized analysis that reveals little about the roles each character plays within his or her particular narrative in addition when i look at the data gathered from books published over nearly three decades i am struck by the consistency of my findings given the changing social contexts in which they were published from  to  there have been dramatic shifts in the status and visibility of gay men and lesbians in us society from  to  however with the exception of the introduction of the aids epidemic as a plot element there have been few changes in any aspect of gay or lesbian characters in ya novels in a society with such volatile political and cultural attitudes toward gay men and lesbians why is this literature so tenaciously conservative to answer this question it is necessary to turn to qualitative approaches to this data with few exceptions these are novels written for and marketed to young adults by major commercial publishers who necessarily have a strong interest in the sales of their product each text is a reflection of deliberate choices made by author and editor regarding the gay lesbian content including character plot dialogue and theme deemed to be appropriate in a work of fiction designed for young adult readers therefore this body of literature stands as a chronological series of texts that may be read as both history and literature thus it is useful to look to theories drawn from these disciplines theoretical models as noted above the earliest ya novel with gay lesbian content was published in  a landmark year in the gay liberation movement as texts situated in the years between stonewall and the present these books reflect a still unfolding evolution of gay awareness in the united states as reflected in its history literature and popular culture if these books offer us sources for a history of representations of gaylesbian people which i believe they do a historiographical model is a highly appropriate lens through which to view this literature over its nearly three decades of publication given that gender plays a major role in the shape of this literature i looked to the work of historian gerda lerner whose theoretical framework for women histonrography provides valuable insights into these textual representations of gaylesbian people 
 the library quarterly this body of works may also be approached as a chronology of literary representations of minority status characters in books written specifically for young readers perhaps the most developed theories describing such works have been advanced by rudine sims bishop an education researcher who has studied representations of africanarnerican characters in children and young adult fiction over time young people literature with african american characters as compared to other minority status groups has a history that stretches back many decades as does its critical study while gay people and african americans are not equivalent groups i believe sims bishop scholarship provides a model that can be adapted usefully to the study of ya literature with gaylesbian characters and content  finally these books may be viewed as reflections of mainstream social attitudes and beliefs about gaylesbian people within the larger us society from this angle the emerging perspective of queer studies offers interesting insights the work of historian george chauncey traces gay male life and culture in pre world war ii new york city and effectively contradicts the myths about gay people perpetuated in the mainstream media and popular culture his identification of patterns specific to popular portrayals of gaylesbian people and their lives focusing on both what is present and what is absent provides a useful comparison for the portrayal of gaylesbian people within mainstream young adult literature  i believe that the scholarship of lerner sims bishop and chauncey can provide valuable perspectives to the understanding of young adult literature with gaylesbian content this application of theoretical frameworks provides answers that lead to further questions it is my hope that this work may suggest approaches to this data from other disciplines that might provide additional insight into this multifaceted subject gerda lerner model of women historiography since gender is a key variable in the tides under consideration i looked to the work of gerda lerner a pioneering women historian who theorized a much cited conceptual framework of research perspectives that describes the various stages of women inclusion in historiography  pp   among the scholars who have used lerner framework as a foundation for their own work is library historian suzanne hildenbrand who built upon lerner perspectives to create a theoretical model specific to scholarship on women in library history  invisibility  compensatory or contributions history  discrimination or
ya novels gaylesbianqueer content  oppression history  women cultural history  women in history  the study of history as traditionally understood in western culture was originally the study of history without women while the existence of women was certainly not denied their work and lives were assumed to be entirely in the shadow of men thus a history of men was thought to encompass a history of women as well women were in a word invisible the first scholarly perspective that includes women is defined as compensatory or contributions history it is based on the assumption that the experiences of men and women have been basically similar and that the addition of some influential but hitherto overlooked great women is sufficient to effect the inclusion of women in history the second perspective referred to as discrimination or oppression history assumes that male and female experiences have been fundamentally different and seeks to document past discrimination against women as a historically oppressed group the third perspective women cultural history also assumes that male and female experiences have been fundamentally different but focuses instead on the historically undervalued activities in which women have been engaged the fourth and final perspective the women in history model is based on the assumption that men and women are neither completely similar nor dissimilar but are instead influenced by a wide range of variables including but not limited to gender this awareness of the contextual gender system enables researchers to view more clearly how the power relationships exist in a given context and how the various actors male and female fit into that frame   this progression is more or less reflected in the chronological history of young adult novels with gaylesbian content in the earliest ya novels from the s and s gaylesbian content was limited to antigay epithets and the occasional shadowy character included to represent the oddities or the dangers of the larger adult world into which young people were moving in maureen daly seventeenth summer  for example angie and jack two teenagers in fond du lac wisconsin go to a local bar to hear a chicago blues musician the musician is one of the first black people angie has ever encountered and she is fascinated not only by his bluesy piano playing but also by the fact that he is wearing red nail polish which she interprets as further evidence of his exotic otherness  p  in madeleine lngle a small rain  the teenage protagonist katherine goes out with friends in new york city and they mischievously take her to a gay bar where katherine encounters a woman or what had perhaps once been a woman now it wore a man suit shirt and tie its hair

 the library quarterly that community this world has been obscured even forgotten and chauncey identifies the three myths of isolation invisibility and internalization that inform this deliberate erasure of the past first the myth of isolation describes earlier gay men as living lives essentially cut off from each other anti gay hostility prevented the development of an extensive gay subculture and forced gay men to lead solitary lives in the decades before the gay liberation movement  p  second the myth of invisibility represents the early gay community as hidden even invisible to all eyes even those of other gay people even if a gay world existed it was kept invisible and thus remained difficult for isolated gay men to find  p  and finally the myth of internalization assures us that all gay men viewed themselves as defective mentally ill pitiful and pitiable gay men uncritically internalized the dominant culture view of them as sick perverted and immoral and that their self hatred led them to accept the policing of their lives rather than resist it  p  these myths have been and continue to be prevalent in ya novels the same sex encounter of donovan young men in  is presented as a temporary aberration even a predictable stage in their development as heterosexual adults  the first character who is identified as a homosexualas opposed to someone who has a homosexual experience appears in  in holland the man without a face a brooding recluse with a haunted past justin mcleod the title character tells charles the teenage protagonist and narrator ie known what i was for a long time  p  emphasis added a flawed and curiously degendered identity that appears to be connected to a car accident responsible for the death of one young man and the facial scars that make mcleod psychological stigma visible he has deliberately isolated himself not only from other gay people apparently since there appear to be no other gay characters in the book but from all other peoplejustin mcleod embodies all the myths identified by chauncey so too does ward in hall sticks and stones he is another reclusive author who isolates himself and sees himself as a polluting influence whom everyone particularly the protagonist tom should shun  in contrast there are a few titles that portray gaylesbian characters actively resisting these myths for example british author david rees in the tent  depicts four boys whose weekend camping trip becomes a near disaster when they are stranded by bad weather in a wilderness area two of them tim and ray unexpectedly come out to each other when it becomes clear that their rescue is imminent the boys talk about future plans and ray tells tim about a gay pub
ya novels gaylesbianqueer content  there places at home where people like us meet ray said are there tim was surprised he never heard of such a thing a pub and some group that meets in somebody house anyway i want to go to this pub at home i don think i dare go in by myself though will you  come with me i don know il think about it nobody going to rape you tim why do you want to go there to meet others like us of course you can live in a vacuum they might be well very strange the men who go to this pub look we can be the only two nice decent homosexuals in the world i suppose not he had a cheering vision of hundreds of happy uncomplicated people enjoying themselves together sharing each others lives i suppose not  pp   this positive portrayal of gay teens reaching out toward a gay community is notable for its active rejection of the myths of isolation invisibility and internalization particularly remarkable in that it was written at a time when american novels were years away from acknowledging that gaylesbian characters might want to have other gaylesbian friends or seek out a larger gay community rees other novels the milkman on his way   out of the winter gardens   and the colour of his hair   also include a gay community however rees was an out gay man who was a well known children author winner of the  carnegie medal england equivalent of the newbery medal for the exeter blitz  as a writer publishing young people books with small gay identified presses london gay men press and boston alyson press david rees who died of aids in  was hardly typical perhaps not surprisingly alyson press also publishes rj hamilton pride pack ya series described above which features a group of gay lesbian and straight teens who hang out at their city gay and lesbian community center   although chauncey identifies these as myths that were prevalent in the past they appear to be alive and well in the present world of ya fiction these myths would not be so tenacious if there were not an element of truth in each of them indeed these myths are present in the day to day social reality of many marginalized groups feelings of isolation invisibility and internalized homophobia however are not static conditions but are rather problems that gaylesbian people like other marginalized groups seek to remedy through self acceptance and by identification or creation of a community of family and friends with whom openness about same sex attractions and relationships is possible however when so many books picture gaylesbian characters solely in isolation or as members of a single isolated couple this consistent limitation appears to confirm and reinforce all three myths
 the library quarterly in the larger world of ya fiction gaylesbian characters are even more isolated appearing in only a small fraction of each year publishing output this relative absence from the larger world reinforces the myth of isolation but even more so the myth of invisibility the isolation of gaylesbian individuals or couples in ya fiction precludes any portrayal of a larger gaylesbian community and ironically it is often the very invisibility of gaylesbian people individually and collectively that weighs so heavily on the minds of teenage characters of all orientations indeed it was their absence more than their presence that was noted at least indirectly in the endless ruminations of protagonists and their friends who worried if they were sufficiently masculine or feminine to make the shift from asexual child to the gender conformity of the dance floor the high school the malt shop or any other entrance point to adolescent and by extension adult society young adult novels are rife with teenage boys who wonder if they can for example play a musical instrument and still be considered masculine and teenage girls who wonder if they can excel in science and still be considered feminine the answer is invariably positive yes it is ok to win the music competitionget a science scholarship without giving up one identity as a truly masculine man or feminine woman but if the question is asked at all it must mean that the answer is not assured which in turn raises the question what if the answer is not yes what or whom do teens fear when they worry about their nonconformity to gender roles the unspoken undescribed and invisible image is that of the man who is not a man the woman who is not a woman that is the gay man or the lesbian and if there are no self identified gay men or lesbians present to provide a reality check for these myths then the internalization of a rigid gender conformity seems almost inevitable while ya books continue to perpetuate these myths there appears to be a weakening of hegemony of negative internalization earlier books portrayed gay and lesbian characters as the flawed results of dysfunctional families and childhood trauma specifically overly protective mothers distant fathers and early sexual assault this assumption began to be challenged in ya fiction in  when klein breaking up featured a lesbian mother and her partner as secondary but apparently self accepting characters who successfully challenge a threatened custody suit  since that time fictional gaylesbian characters are increasingly likely to describe internalized homophobia in the past tense as a notion they rejected early in their coming out process more recently this assumption is often located within the perspective of apparently straight characters and is cited as the reason for negative behavior name calling harassment and gay bashing gaylesbian
ya novels gaylesbianqueer content  orientation is usually described benignly and gaylesbian characters are if anything more intelligent mature and well adjusted than their straight friends and relatives who frequently approach them for advice on romantic and family relationship problems yet this may also be a reflection of another stereotype applied to minority groups an eitheror portrayal that depicts them as entirely depraved or wholly saindlike the wild indian or the noble savage despite the more positive spin of the good gay sage as a character type it is still a stereotype rather than a fully developed character this stereotype coupled with the persistence of isolation and invisibility in the world of ya fiction continues to inform a genre that may or may not be accurately described as contemporary realism common threads and recurring issues several common threads weave throughout these considerations of analytical frameworks suggested by lerner sims bishop and chauncey these recurring tensions include questions of authenticity and realism the relationship between gaylesbian people and children in traditional families and the differenceno difference dichotomy in conflicting understandings of sexual identity and gaylesbian people the first overarching issue that arises is the intertwined concern of realism and authenticity do the lives of gaylesbian people in these novels of contemporary realism appear to reflect the real lives of contemporary gaylesbian people is there a correlation between portrayals of gaylesbian people in ya fiction and nonfiction questions of authenticity engage the librarians teachers and parents who are looking for literature that is truly multicultural in searching for authentic portrayals of the experiences of racial ethnic and cultural minorities some believe that only a member of a given minority group can write accurately about that group while others believe that stories are only limited by the writer imagination not surprisingly the same questions arise in evaluating fiction with gaylesbian content certainly authors can write sympathetically even empathetically about characters who do not resemble themselves but it can be difficult to capture the subtleties of culture the nuances that convey the flavor of life from within a marginalized group more difficult than details of food language and setting is seeing the story through the other eyes and sustaining that vision in the telling as bell hooks asked in from margin to center  a critique of literature from a black feminist perspective can we decenter the text is it possible to place the marginal view at the center
 the library quarterly at this point in time fictional gaylesbian people are more or less comfortably visible to the usually heterosexual ya protagonist but they are still seen as other with a few exceptions it appears that it is not yet possible for a mainstream young adult novel with gaylesbian content to take any vantage point except that of the mainstream and gaylesbian characters continue to be portrayed as outsiders who live often somewhat precariously within the heterosexual mainstream but who will never really be one of us other minority status groups have begun to be represented in ya fiction that places them and their world at the center and tells the story from their perspective this is not yet the case for gay men and lesbians stories of gaylesbian culture and community told from a perspective located within that culture continue to be rare in ya fiction this dogged adherence to narratives from a majority perspective in ya fiction with gaylesbian content is particularly intriguing when contrasted with recent ya nonfiction books such as roger sutton hearing us out voicesfrom the gay and lesbian community   ann heron two teenagers in twenty   and larry dane brimner being different lambda youths speak out   contain multiple narrative voices of gay men and lesbians telling the stories of their lives as they move through the mainstream and the margins the narratives contain common elements coming out stories for example as well as disparate elements provided by varying persons settings and situations these real life protagonists are situated outside the mainstream their intended audience in various locations from margin to center why the disparity between fiction and nonfiction why this resistance to realistic gay and lesbian voices as fictional narrators and protagonists and why the avoidance of any portrayal of the communities and friendship networks that are part of so many gay and lesbian lives the children the family and the community children represent the continuation of families and are strongly identified with them indeed many people feel that children are not only members of a family but that it is their presence that makes a family that bestows the social legitimation associated with families as they are traditionally understood individual family members may be gay or lesbian but the traditional family is a heterosexual institution which makes a family gaylesbian members a curious anomaly they share the same gene pool and perhaps the same last name but many feel that their sexual orientation places them outside even their own families of origin particularly in relation to that family children this stricture
ya novels gaylesbianqueer content  extends even more strongly to any connection between children and gaylesbian people who are not blood relatives among the patterns that emerge from these novels is a consistent oppositional relationship between traditional families of parents and children and the gaylesbian community this is most clearly illustrated in kaye real heroes  kevin physical education teacher mr logan is hiv positive this fact is revealed when his name appears on the membership list of an hiv support group that is coordinated by jason the openly gay older brother of kevin best friend andy when mr logan hiv status becomes common knowledge a group of parents mobilize to have him fired after some weeks of school meetings and hostile picket lines he finally quits sacrificing his job for his students education he explains this to kevin as he packs up his belongings to move to atlanta in all this mr logan is alone as the editor of a national gay magazine jason clearly has a community as a teacher facing job discrimination mr logan community is apparently entirely outside of and absent from the school community the conflict is set up as mr logan struggle between loyalty to the gay community and concern for the children and he chooses the children the underlying assumption is that the gay community has no connections with children and that choices made on behalf of children would not be the same as choices made on behalf of gay people in real heroes the interests of children and of gay people are by their very nature in conflict i wanted to stay kevin and i could have stayed many of my friends thought i should become a symbol to show a community that a person with hiv can continue to work effectively that we do not put others at risk your friend andy brother jason said i had an obligation to others with hiv to take a stand but i had another obligation to my students if i stayed and the disruptions continued it would be at your expense that wouldn be fair to you kids so you see kevin i wasn giving up i was making a choice it was a hard choice but most important choices are if i stayed you kids would suffer so i chose to leave  p  this narrative places the gay community and nuclear families at opposing and seemingly irreconcilable sides of a conflict and the teacher with self sacrificing nobility makes what he sees as the moral choice he leaves and in doing so has done the right thing by placing the needs of the children above the needs of his community as in other novels about gay people with or without hiv or aids real heroes provides few details about the gay community except to place it somewhere else a location entirely separate from the family home m e kerr nightkites  penny durant wien heroes die  davis my brother has aids  cooper life magic  and gregory
