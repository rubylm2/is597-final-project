jane maud campbell was born on march   in liverpool england of parents of scottish descent george and jane cameron campbell who had met and married in petersburg virginia maud campbell was one of seven children the first of two daughters born after the birth of five sons during the american civil war patriarch george campbells shipping business primarily transporting cotton tobacco and other dry goods for the confederacy had made the large campbell family at home on both sides of the atlantic in england and scotland as well as in the united states from the s and into the s after an abrupt end to his shipping enterprise george campbell tried to recoup his losses by redirecting his energy and resources to the tanning industry with attempts in burkeville virginia charles town west virginia and finally in harrison new jersey near east orange after the death of her mother campbells father on august   married as his second wife rosalie higgenbotham of richmond virginia george and rosalie campbell lived at that time in liverpool but soon bought an estate near london in dulwich surrey george campbell and his second wife were to have five sons the young maud campbell was taught until the age of ten by governesses at the campbells home in dulwich while living at dulwich in june  george campbell and rosalie entertained his friends jefferson and varina davis for the last time family members recall this famous visit when four year old anne campbell rode on mr daviss shoulders holding onto his head from her precarious perch at age twelve maud campbell was educated at a girls school near richmond virginia george campbell who did not find female schooling in virginia up to his standards sent maud at age fourteen and anne at age twelve to edinburgh where they lived with their grandmother ann macdonald campbell on dalrymple crescent on the same block where robert louis stevenson lived while there the two young women attended the ladies college of edinburgh university maud studying literature and anne music maud graduated first and earned a certificate from the edinburgh school of cookery and domestic economy while waiting for sister annes graduation she and anne were present in london at the jubilee celebration of queen victoria in  before coming to the united states and settling with their family in east orange new jersey during the next two years campbell made two return trips to scotland the first to settle her grandmothers estate and the second to visit friends and family in scotland and travel for six months in switzerland shortly thereafter campbell immigrated to america permanently to be with her father in east orange near where he made his final attempt at the tanning business and where for a brief time he collaborated with his friend thomas alva edison library service with immigrants in newark having spent the early years of her adult life as the caregiver and nurturer for her extended close knit family and for a time as bookkeeper for the family tanning supply business in west virginia with brother willie maud campbell was thirty two years old before she exerted her independence in  she applied for and after a competitive examination secured a position as assistant in the reference department of the newark public library where she was the only staff member able to type campbell had no formal library training george campbell was quoted as saying maudie saw the notice of an exam for librarian and tried it without telling anyone they phoned her to come and she went ahead nicely beginning at  a month  working under the tutelage of frank p hill director of the newark public library and later of his successor john cotton dana campbell learned the principles of librarianship her duties as reference librarian brought her into contact with various charitable and educational institutions throughout the newark community most of which worked with immigrant clientele she lectured on the resources and services available through the public library and as a result of these contacts she established traveling libraries and deposit stations in stores throughout the bustling metropolis of newark with a foreign born population of over  percent at that time after a period of eighteen months of efficient service to quote john cotton dana director of the newark nj public library campbell was offered the position of public librarian at both perth amboy and passaic the new jersey cities with the largest immigrant populations notwithstanding the high praise of dana who referred to campbell as a very competent woman the fact that campbell was an immigrant herself undoubtedly swayed the boards of both public libraries campbell chose passaic  library service with immigrants in passaic and new jersey located in the industrial northeast of new jersey passaic was the city where the rags to riches scottish immigrant peter reid had made his fortune in textile manufacturing the new jane watson reid memorial library named in honor of reids wife and opened in early  was situated in the heart of the dundee district of passaic where reids textile mills flourished reid and the library trustees of passaic took satisfaction in the knowledge that the reid memorial branch as well as the main library in the passaic city hall would be administered by an immigrant of campbells ability as a progressive reformer campbell was motivated by a sense of urgency to do what was possible for the immigrants crowding into passaic she was not afraid or reluctant to seek advice she learned from other librarians library trustees library benefactors community leaders politicians editors of the foreign language press and immigrant themselves she never turned down an opportunity to share what she had learned at state regional or national library association conventions church services or meetings of patriotic societies charitable institutions or social welfare organizations  campbells remarks to the  american library association annual conference in niagara new york revealed her vision for public library service in passaic or any small town in america as a purely democratic institution existing to serve the will of its constituents and for the librarian as a proactive advocate for all segments of the community  p   pp  the  address published in the library journal helped to establish her reputation as a speaker and communicator talents that would place her before countless audiences throughout her career the reaction of her friend and former colleague in newark clara whitehill hunt was revealing hunt who had followed former newark nj public library director frank hill to the brooklyn public library where she was superintendent of the childrens rooms wrote william coggin kimball chairman of the board of trustees of the passaic public library to tell him how beautifully your representative carried off the honors for passaic last night hunt advised kimball that youd better get a tight grip on your librarian for she made a hit in the ala  campbell was an active participant in the debate within the american public library community regarding the efficacy of providing collections of books in foreign languages the us citizenry at large at the turn of the twentieth century were of two minds the provision of foreign language books was viewed as either a natural extension of library service to immigrant taxpayers or an unnecessary hindrance to their learning of english and a waste of tax dollars activist librarians like campbell supported the former service philosophy campbells strategy for helping immigrants to adjust to life in passaic involved getting to them before they could speak english and before they were exploited by corrupt politicians cornered by well meaning but unwelcome proselytizers arrested for breaking laws of which they were ignorant or otherwise disenchanted with america and americans campbell was convinced that library work with immigrants rather than being merely an enlightened gesture on the part of librarians was a dialogue a give and take proposition in which both parties benefited   in  in an address delivered to the long island library club in brooklyn campbell described the public library as a bridge to opportunity for poor and intellectually starved potential american citizens as well as preserver of humanistic culture campbell who spoke only english and perhaps a bit of gaelic never seemed to find the language barrier an insurmountable obstacle communicating her humanitarian concern for people in need through the universal language of compassion sympathy and genuine understanding  p  campbell convinced the board of trustees of the passaic public library that in order to serve the immigrant population the library had to provide books periodicals and newspapers not only in english but also in the foreign languages spoken by its various constituencies the library should provide books and technical guides for industries employing immigrants newspapers instructional aids and periodicals in immigrant languages particularly those containing information about the customs history and government of the united states and the laws statutes ordinances and regulations regarding health sanitation employment and education that were enforced in the city of passaic and the state of new jersey materials to fulfill these educational needs and to provide a source of relaxation and escape from the long hours in the factories and mills and the constant strain of domestic duties were secured and library hours were extended to accommodate the lifestyles of working immigrants   pp  campbell turned to the leaders of the immigrant community for assistance in selection acquisition and cataloging of foreign language books the editors of the foreign language press often scholars in their own right were generous with newspaper space for advertising the librarys foreign language acquisitions and holdings she consulted with local immigrant booksellers and established foreign language book dealers throughout the country who advised her on availability quality and turnaround time to be expected when importing foreign language materials she tapped the expertise of the immigrant literary and cultural societies whose members being thoroughly versed in the literatures of particular ethnic or national groups were able to assist her in cataloging the foreign language materials a hungarian bookseller in the neighborhood took her to his stall in the dilapidated attic of a livery stable where she found books in hungarian and purchased seventy five in the first half hour in a similar chance encounter she persuaded an italian barber to help catalog the italian books that she had bought for the reading room  p  the result of this collaboration was a collection of books in english as well as eleven foreign languagesfrench german dutch italian hungarian russian bohemian slovene polish hebrew and yiddishthat was available to library patrons in passaic with the exception of the books in french german and dutch languages of the old immigrants the remaining eight languages were languages spoken by the new immigrants in the  annual report of the passaic public library campbell included a statistic that proved that the immigrants were appreciative and enthusiastic readers in twelve months the five hundred and fifty books in the eleven foreign languages we then had were borrowed  times  p   pp  campbell turned the passaic public library into a haven for rest and relaxation for working adults and for children a quiet place where they could study and complete their school assignments without the constant interruptions associated with the crowded tenement lifestyle under her leadership the passaic public library became a community center for programs for adults and youth  pp  the library served as a club room for social groups and debating societies and a recreation area where patrons could play checkers chess ping pong and other games and also served as the classroom where continuing education opportunities were always available including americanization classes sewing classes and lectures on topics of immediate and vital interest to immigrants exhibits of european arts and crafts attracted foreigners inside the library once inside the unassimilated immigrants would notice books about the history of their new country in languages they could read and dictionaries with the names of tools used in the nearby mills where they worked campbell remarked that it is a poor introduction to america to learn its laws only through breaking them because of not being able to read posted signs  p   p   the library provided space and scheduled time for a series of free lectures in english on topics of general interest to the immigrant community the leaders of the foreign societies notably the italian slovene polish bohemian and hungarian approached campbell with the proposition that they would provide lecturers in their respective native languages if the library would provide the space for the scheduled lectures she was receptive to their proposition and it became the standard practice to have lectures given in english and then in the languages of the nationalities or ethnic groups sponsoring the events   p  when social ills were apparent and called for reform campbell could always be counted upon to defend the policy of free immigration provide books in foreign languages lobby for a fair wage for immigrant laborers or petition health and sanitation officials for more frequent inspections of tenements campbell a cultural pluralist believed that american culture was an amalgamation of cultures each offering a unique gift to the building of american society the word multiculturalism was not yet in vogue but it would have been appropriate in the early decades of the twentieth century to describe the work of campbell and other librarians working with foreign born populations the compulsory education laws requiring the regular attendance at public schools of children under the age of fourteen assured at least a minimal education for immigrant children including instruction in the english language and the inculcation of american ideals and values campbell realized that the evening schools for adult immigrants were not as successful because they were not available in all communities throughout new jersey on a year round basis and their establishment rather than being mandated by state law remained a local option the same narrow rationale that the provision of foreign language books in public libraries was a hindrance to learning english also surfaced in the argument that evening school teachers should speak and understand only english the logic was that adult immigrants would hear only the language that they were expected to master a further complication to this already difficult situation was the fact that most evening school classes were composed of adult immigrants of more than one nationality  pp   campbell discussed her ideas about increasing the educational opportunities for adult immigrants in new jersey with passaic public library trustee william coggin kimball he was serving concurrently as chairman of the new jersey public library commission along with new jersey supreme court justice john franklin fort later to be governor of new jersey both kimball and fort were impressed with campbells ideas and the expertise demonstrated in her library work with immigrants in passaic  kimball helped campbell to gain an interview with new jersey governor edward casper stokes two months later on april   governor stokes acting upon the authorization of the new jersey legislature and granted only the previous day appointed campbell a member of a commission of three along with john dyneley prince a professor at columbia university in new york and d f merritt of montclair new jersey the  new jersey immigration commission whose charge was to inquire into and report upon the general condition of the immigrants coming into or residents of this state was the first state commission according to robert watchorn then us commissioner of immigration to treat the immigration problem in a rational and systematic way campbell the first woman appointed to a new jersey commission was presented a unique opportunity to improve adult immigrant education  p   on march   campbells father george a native of scotland and then residing in east orange new jersey was admitted to us citizenship it is almost certain that maud campbell helped her father through the naturalization process as she had done for immigrant patrons in passaic family records indicate that maud campbell assumed that she was naturalized along with her father being a member of his household technically this would have been the case if maude campbell had been a minor child and not a thirty seven year old adult it is also highly likely that maud campbell was told by immigration and naturalization officials that it was not necessary for her to go through the process since she resided in her fathers household this incident illustrates how lax officials were about the naturalization process for english speaking white immigrants from the british isles naturalization made it possible for george campbell to vote maud campbell along with all american women until  the year of the passage of the nineteenth amendment to the us constitution was denied the vote   also that summer of  at the ala narragansett pier conference in rhode island campbell joined james hulme canfield of columbia university and arthur e bostwick of the circulation department of the new york public library to present a three part forum on books for the foreign population all three speakers were convinced of the need for basic books in simple english and foreign languages on american educational and political systems and employment opportunities throughout the country determining the source or sources of fiscal support for such materials was really the crux of the debate canfield proposed that the ala study the issue of public library service to immigrants and to work in close cooperation with the national educational association bostwick suggested reliance on civic and patriotic societies to supply these materials rather than the ala campbell called on librarians to solicit the advice of immigrant community leaders on the best or most helpful books on subjects of interest to immigrants alluding to her appointment to the  new jersey commission on immigration she called on the ala and state library associations to agitate for the appointment of state commissions on immigration to investigate the general condition of non english speaking residents with the view to their education and enlightenment upon the principles and policy of our government and institutions and the rights and opportunities of its citizens  librarians throughout the country particularly branch librarians librarians of small libraries and foreign language department librarians read the print versions of these remarks in the pages of the library journal and in turn shared in print their own observations opinions and successes with the americanization process ironically an unsigned editorial in the july  issue of new york libraries warned that the danger in americanization work was not that foreign languages would be retained too long by the foreign born but that in a generation or two they might be lost as an element of culture in american life nevertheless campbell and progressive librarians having gained experienced in dealing with more than one immigrant group saw library service to immigrants in the light of internationalism a step away from americanization and a step closer to cultural pluralism or multiculturalism    as her part in the work of the  new jersey immigration commission campbell garnered the support of the foreign societies in new jersey she visited the president of the national slavonic society in new york and solicited his help in convincing the affiliated societies in new jersey to send letters and petitions to governor stokes stating their support for the establishment of a permanent governmental agency to handle immigration affairs as a result governor stokes received an avalanche of letters from immigrant leaders the  commission completed its mandate in december of that same year at a banquet in princeton new jersey the commission had concluded that the education of the adult immigrant was the key to successful assimilation campbell voiced her support for the establishment of evening schools on a statewide basis similar to the experimental schools for italians in passaic and princeton and also schools for adult immigrants in trenton and burlington the commission published and distributed a primer in italian and english for the adult italian immigrant learning english governor stokes who referred to campbell as a most progressive woman concurred with her findings and those of the other commissioners and lauded their efforts on behalf of new jersey  the  new jersey immigration commission did not publish a report of its findings and recommendations as a direct result of the work of the  new jersey immigration commission in  the new jersey legislature passed a law that encouraged but did not mandate communities throughout new jersey to set up evening schools for adult immigrants the  adult immigrant education law provided for the boards of education of any new jersey school district to establish public evening schools for the instruction of foreign born residents over fourteen years of age in english and civics another section of the law dealing with the funding of these evening schools included the provision that the state would match any funds raised by a school district for the maintenance of public evening schools for immigrant adults there was still no requirement for the establishment of evening schools on a statewide basis  despite these oversights the  new jersey adult immigrant education law set the pattern for other states including new york california massachusetts pennsylvania and rhode island that followed the example of new jersey and appointed commissions to survey the needs of immigrants on a statewide basis  addressing the provision of foreign language books in public libraries serving immigrant populations continued to be a nationwide concern from  to  the ala publishing board addressed this need by publishing in its foreign book list series a total of seven guides for the selection and acquisition of books in german hungarian french danish norwegian swedish polish and russian in  under the auspices of the new jersey public library commission campbell compiled the bibliography of recommended titles in the hungarian language for public libraries which was later adopted for use by the league of library commissions in the introduction to her selected list of hungarian books campbell described the guide as simply a list of books which hungarians are proud to recommend and pleased to read themselves she gave the credit for its publication to a hungarian immigrant scholar and editor in new york and members of the hungarian literary society in passaic  p   p   in may  campbell decided to leave her position in passaic in order to concentrate her efforts in the area of adult immigrant education campbell saw her move as the natural outgrowth of the experiences she had gained in the cosmopolitan industrial center of passaic on may   at the meeting of the board of trustees of the passaic public library campbells friend and supporter trustee william coggin kimball and passaics mayor bird w spencer presented her with a citation that extolled her ability tact industry inspiration and advocacy for the poor and foreign born of passaic  adult education with immigrants in new york state the desire to pursue her ideas in the field of adult immigrant education coupled with an employment opportunity offered by anne morgan daughter of philanthropist and businessman john pierpont j p morgan prompted her to accept a position as education secretary for the recently organized new york city committee of the north american civic league for immigrants nacli the nacli founded in boston in  was an active americanization group an outgrowth of a conference of social workers and reform minded citizens sponsored a year earlier in february  by the international committee of the young mens christian association in new york city nacli membership was anglo conformist in philosophy and conservative in economic interests the nacli advertised itself as not being concerned with the highly political issue of admission or exclusion of immigrants but with the more humanitarian issues of protection education distribution and assimilation of immigrants once they had arrived in the united states in addition to boston the nacli established branches in new york and philadelphia the nacli sponsored extensive programs of lectures in english and foreign languages to evening schools which were published as messages for newcomers to the united states and distributed to public libraries throughout the united states in  the new york state immigration commission was appointed by governor charles evans hughes to investigate the condition of immigrants throughout new york state in march  the commission recommended the establishment of evening schools for immigrants that would speed the process of americanization there being no organization to take over its work and to see that the legislation it had recommended was enacted the commissions former members approached the leadership of the nacli hartmann refers to the  new york state immigration commission as the first in the country when actually it was second to the  new jersey immigration commission on which campbell served in december  the administrative district under the auspices of the nacli new york city branch was expanded to incorporate new york state in early  the newly renamed nacli new york committee accepted the recommendations of the new york immigration commission as its mission campbell began her duties with the nacli new york committee in the summer of  by september  the committee had been successful in getting the new york state legislature to pass the immigration bills recommended by the  new york state immigration commission including the major bill to establish the new york bureau of industries and immigration to oversee immigrant affairs from banking and employment to legal aid and education campbell coordinated the establishment of classes in english and citizenship for newly arrived immigrants in new york city in order to address and assess the needs of immigrant children covered by the compulsory education laws the nacli new york committee using ships manifests at ellis island compiled lists of the names of school age children entering the port of new york these were then transferred to the proper school authorities in permanent and temporary educational facilities throughout new york state by march  the nacli new york committee was successful in convincing the federal authorities to assume the responsibility for providing such lists to school authorities not only in new york but also in new jersey massachusetts illinois and other states where the majority of immigrants might establish residences campbells responsibilities with the nacli also included the on site development implementation and supervision of programs to facilitate the americanization of the immigrant laborers and their families in temporary labor camps falling outside the jurisdiction of local school districts in december  the nacli new york committee established an experimental camp school in valhalla new york the site of one of the construction camps building the catskill aqueduct to serve the needs of new york city in valhalla campbell worked with adult immigrant workers and their families largely italians poles russians and austrians in january  the nacli new york committee again expanded its jurisdiction to include the state of new jersey shortly thereafter the newly renamed nacli new yorknew jersey committee convinced new jersey governor woodrow wilson to appoint the  new jersey immigration commission the  commission like its predecessors was charged to investigate the conditions of immigrants with regard to their welfare and distribution as well as industrial opportunities available to them without state funding the  new jersey immigration commission had to rely on the financial support of civic minded individuals and the nacli new yorknew jersey committee the  commission was unable to get legislation passed to establish a permanent state agency to handle immigrant affairs as had been done in new york state and as such accomplished nothing of significance other than producing an informative report of its findings the nacli new yorknew jersey committee advanced its work in the construction camp school at valhalla by april  a special assembly hall was opened to take care of the educational needs of immigrant children women and men a day school was operated in the hall for the children while in the afternoon classes in home economics and sewing were held for the women and girls an evening school for the immigrant men provided instruction in english and preparation for citizenship the two facets of the americanization process during the summer of  campbell experimented with a new invention with the potential to revolutionize the educational process the movie camera she visited movie houses in the area to learn the techniques of operating it and got hints on projecting the films from her fathers friend thomas alva edison beginning in june using a horse and covered wagon for transportation campbell provided moving pictures with musical accompaniment provided by phonograph recordings to a circuit of fourteen temporary labor camps situated along the construction route of the catskill aqueduct the moving picture shows presented advice on health regulations personal hygiene state and federal laws the naturalization process and technical instruction on various aspects of aqueduct construction the experiment which lasted eighty seven days reached over seven thousand viewers several construction contractors agreed to purchase the moving pictures and projection equipment to inaugurate recreational programs for the immigrant laborers in other temporary labor camps in the september  issue of the catskill water system news one such contractor described the valhalla construction camp school as producing a better class of men a better camp and a higher standard of living than is generally found which all makes for efficiency to round out these educational activities recreational activities eventually included a popular moving picture show every saturday night and a dance once a month campbell saw the necessity of providing leisure activities since the only other diversions for the construction workers after eight hours of manual labor were gambling and drinking  pp   under the auspices of the nacli campbell maintained a full schedule of lecturing in april  she presented an address on the social and educational needs of immigrant women to social workers at a meeting of the new jersey conference of charities and correction held at princeton she acknowledged the prejudice against immigrants manifested in the constant calls from the us congress for immigration restriction and voiced her advocacy for the suffrage of women both native born and foreign born she was dismayed by the widening of the generation gap between immigrant parents and their children which was unwittingly exacerbated by the exposure of immigrant children to the americanizing influence of the public schools campbell believed that the most difficult problem with the immigrant woman is to make her appreciate the advantages of education which to her is something only for the men and children  p  she experimented with creative ways to lure immigrant women to take part in educational opportunities offered by the nacli sewing cooking and child care classes were often the bait to get immigrant women out of the confines of their homes and the congested immigrant community campbell exposed immigrant women to the americanizing influence of hearing spoken english and gave them a forum to share everyday experiences with other americans in the making  in  the  federal immigration commission included the telling statistic that the great majority of the injuries and fatalities in the mines occur because the foreigner does not understand words of command  p  campbell was convinced that the problem lay in the lack of age appropriate materials for teaching english to adult immigrant laborers to remedy this lack the nacli new yorknew jersey committee wrote and printed a series of elementary english lessons based on everyday words and phrases used in the construction work at the temporary labor camps and arranged in parallel english italian and english polish since the majority of the laborers were italian and polish immigrants pamphlets and leaflets explaining the naturalization requirements for first and second papers and the basic laws of the united states including child labor and compulsory education laws and sanitary regulations were also prepared and printed in english and the foreign languages spoken by the construction workers and their families the construction camp school in valhalla initiated on an experimental localized basis under campbells direction became the model emulated throughout new york state the new york state legislature passed a law introduced initially by the new york state department of education that required that public schools which were established for laborers in temporary construction camps engaged in public works projects should be maintained out of the funds designated for these public works projects making access to education by immigrant laborers legally sanctioned in new york state  pp   pp   p  library service with immigrants in massachusetts in early  the nacli recommended the appointment of a state immigration commission for massachusetts by may  the lobbying efforts of the nacli were successful in getting the massachusetts legislature to appoint the  massachusetts immigration commission charged to investigate fully the status and general condition of immigrants the educational opportunities of immigrants were to be assessed but this commission was the first to examine and document the existing public library resources services and facilities available to immigrants the massachusetts free public library commission mfplc under the direction of charles francis dorr belden was a step ahead of the massachusetts immigration commission approximately two months earlier on march   belden had submitted to governor eugene noble foss a recommendation to provide library service to the immigrant population scattered throughout massachusetts the recommendation alluded to the fact that since the fall of  the mfplc had been investigating the possibility of providing statewide service to cities and towns serving immigrant clientele especially those communities whose tax valuation was under  and that the response to their initial efforts had been enthusiastic belden recommended that the massachusetts legislature appropriate funds for the employment of a special field agent or secretary who can study the problems involved the field agent would select the books cooperate with existing associations and visit the local foreign societies in different towns and interest the librarians trustees teachers and others in the furtherance of their activities with the foreign population belden reassured governor foss that libraries are recognized as wholly non political and non sectarian and therefore have a special opportunity to welcome newcomers to this country and interest them in all that pertains to good citizenship  p  governor foss saw in this recommendation a politically expedient way to ward off the potential problems often associated with a large un americanized immigrant population scattered throughout the state two days later on march   governor foss forwarded the mfplcs request to the massachusetts legislature warning that the fulfillment of the request would not solve all the problems associated with immigration but that to do nothing was to court disaster on may   less than two months after beldens initial proposal the massachusetts legislature passed a law authorizing the mfplc to appoint an agent or secretary to direct educational work for the benefit of the alien population of the commonwealth at a salary  not exceeding two thousand dollars  pp  belden immediately began a national search to fill the new position  in the meantime campbell had relocated to massachusetts and secured a temporary position as social agent of the boston dwelling house association while she searched for permanent employment  in late may  approximately one week after the massachusetts legislature had approved the bill authorizing the appointment of an agent for coordinating library work with foreigners on a statewide basis the massachusetts library club held its annual meeting at williams college in williamstown belden was in attendance and listened with particular interest to the two speakers for this event both having been engaged to speak on the topic of library work with foreigners john foster carr of the immigrant publication society of new york city and jane maud campbell formerly of the passaic public library  campbells address entitled what the foreigner has done for one library recounted her experiences working with the immigrant populations in passaic and also with the  new jersey immigration commission belden was impressed with her belief that the librarys influence should spread beyond the librarys walls into the community at large and with her confidence that librarians would be transformed through their contacts with immigrants  pp   belden later offered her the position of director of library work with foreigners on june   barely one month after the massachusetts library club meeting belden wrote edward f hamlin executive secretary in the state house in boston and asked that he submit to governor foss and the massachusetts legislature the name of miss j maud campbell who became the first person appointed by any state to give her entire time and thought to immigration problems in their relation to the social problems of library work  beginning her duties in september  campbell was immediately called upon to share her experience and expertise with the newly appointed  massachusetts immigration commission appointed earlier in may  campbell conducted a statewide survey of library resources and services available to immigrants which necessitated numerous visits and conversations with library officials and immigrant leaders in cities and towns with immigrant populations throughout the state she provided the commission with an accurate but bleak description of the situation in massachusetts with regard to library work with immigrants of  libraries reporting a foreign speaking population in their territory only  have any foreign books    campbells efforts on behalf of the immigrant communities in massachusetts were limited to small towns with a tax base of less than  a figure soon upgraded to  campbell determined that the best way to serve the needs of the scattered and shifting populations of immigrants throughout the state was to establish traveling libraries of books both in foreign languages and in english for beginners to be circulated on a rotation basis at the request of town libraries serving immigrant populations within two weeks of her employment campbell began her circuit by train to libraries throughout massachusetts in her words to awaken the social conscience  p  of librarians and would be advocates for immigrants although the legislature had seen the need for helping immigrants statewide the library staffs and trustees across the bay state were not as convinced or committed campbells niece fay campbell reed kaynor in her research on her aunt maudie discovered that all across the state of massachusetts from provincetown to north adams and from southwick to haverill at a rate of three times a week the public librarians of massachusetts had their social consciences awakened their patriotism redefined their prejudices pointed out their opportunities designated and their best sources of foreign books listed geographically  p  campbell prescribed library sponsored festivals that would bring the lore crafts music and dance of home countries into the lives of these families and bring the young and old together kaynor continued that she was always bridging gapsbetween generations between old and new homelands between leisure and learning between home and library and between what existed and what was possible campbell pointed out the inconsistency that existed between what was preached to immigrants on their arrival in the united states specifically to leave the industrial cities for farming opportunities in the more healthful rural areas and the lack of agricultural leaflets written in languages the immigrants could understand  p  by early  when the massachusetts immigration commissions report was issued nineteen traveling libraries in three languages french italian and polish had already begun their circuit throughout the state in their final report the commission had recommended that the mfplc receive an increased appropriation so that it may greatly extend the traveling foreign language feature of its work  pp   campbell was able to increase the number of traveling libraries due largely to the additional financial support of foreign societies notably the dante alighieri society and the circolo italiano american patriotic societies including the national society of the colonial dames of america and the daughters of the american revolution and the boston based womens organization the womans education association included in the traveling libraries in addition to primers in english and aids for immigrants preparing for naturalization were foreign language and simple english titles about american laws history government and customs including the immigrants guides in italian polish yiddish and english published by john foster carrs immigrant publication society pamphlets on child care and home economics issued by the metropolitan life insurance company and textbooks on first aid and other health related topics supplied by the american national red cross in italian polish lithuanian and slovene foreign governments also donated books notably the king oscars traveling libraries of books in swedish for swedish speaking immigrants the traveling library service grew from nineteen libraries in three foreign languages in  to sixty libraries in eight foreign languages in  in less than ten years there would be  traveling libraries including books in twenty foreign languages campbell reported in the mfplc  annual report that a start has thus been made in breaking down the prejudice that has existed against foreigners using the libraries  p   pp   p   pp    campbell a life member and active participant in the massachusetts library club the forerunner of the massachusetts library association used its bulletin to provide bibliographies of foreign language materials which were targeted at small to medium sized libraries in one bibliography for example campbell made recommendations for purchase of the one best periodical in terms of style content price and availability in twenty languagesarabic armenian bohemian croatian danish finnish french german greek italian norwegian polish portuguese romanian russian slovene spanish swedish syrian and yiddish with the financial support of a boston civic group the old south association campbell addressed the dearth of suitable foreign language materials for immigrant adults by contacting authors and lecturers in massachusetts and surrounding states urging them to produce books and pamphlets that could be used by libraries throughout the country and encouraging them to deliver lectures in foreign languages to immigrant audiences in town halls and public libraries  pp   p   pp   in  the mfplc again in financial cooperation with the old south association engaged alberto pecorini editor of an italian newspaper in new york il cittadino to lecture in italian on the opportunities for italians in america pecorinis lectures to italian audiences called on italian immigrants to learn english attend evening schools use public libraries and keep their children in schools due to campbells influence pecorini eventually published in  his history of the united states written in a bilingual format english italian pecorinis the story of america became a popular textbook for the adult italian immigrant learning english  pp    pp    pp    pp   pp   pp   p   beginning in  the mfplc in cooperation with simmons college in boston offered annual summer institutes for massachusetts librarians that featured classes in and discussion groups on various aspects of librarianship campbells round tables on americanization and library work with immigrants were regularly offered also that same year campbells acquaintance with corinna s canoutas the wife of seraphim george canoutas a boston lawyer and writer resulted in the publication of a cookbook and handbook on child care written in greek the recipes in the greek cookbook called for ingredients available in american grocery stores and were adapted to the lifestyles of greek immigrant mothers  p    p   p   also in  the ala publishing board published campbells second bibliography in the foreign book list series selected list of russian books in the introduction campbell gave full credit to two russian scholars who because of their familiarity with russia and the russian book trade were in a position to judge just what sort of books would be most appreciated by the russian people who use our public libraries  p   during campbells early years with the mfplc she lived in brookline massachusetts a suburban community within a short commuting distance of her office at the massachusetts state house in boston in  campbells father george after the death of his second wife rosalie moved from east orange new jersey to live with her in brookline and to renew their close relationship campbell also welcomed into her home her niece and nephew georgia campbell waterman and thomas tileston waterman the children of her sister anne campbell waterman the time at home in brookline was happy for the family oriented campbell who kept the public and private sides of her life very separate family members years later were amazed to discover that their modest aunt maudie had been a firebrand in her day in the fall of  george campbell was in a trolley accident and lived only a few months longer he died december   almost a year before the conclusion of world war i campbell along with niece and nephew georgia and tom waterman moved from brookline to a residence on the north side of bostons beacon hill district two blocks from her office at the massachusetts state house and close to a thriving italian neighborhood in the north end  during world war i campbell planned and implemented programs for non english speaking soldiers temporarily stationed in massachusetts confronted with troops who did not speak or understand commands or instructions in english the armed forces personnel at camp devens intensified their efforts to provide courses in english for non english speaking recruits camp educators turned to the mfplc for assistance in obtaining english textbooks written in the foreign languages understood by the immigrant soldiers although the virtual standstill of the book trade with european countries thwarted efforts to provide foreign language library service during wartime the mfplc was able to supply small quantities of english textbooks in twelve of the foreign languages spoken by the servicemen stationed at camp devens and through the traveling library service supplied additional recreational and educational books as a special service the mfplc provided lecturers in foreign languages for hospitalized soldiers who often understood neither their physicians nor their officers and fellow soldiers captain ernest j hall an army officer in charge of morale at camp devens wrote campbell on december   approximately a month after the armistice was signed and thanked her and the mfplc on behalf of the foreign born soldiers who deeply appreciated the possibility of reading good literature in their native tongue hall remarked that the availability of books in arabic armenian finnish french greek italian lithuanian polish portuguese russian swedish and yiddish had been of great assistance to the military authorities in maintaining a good spirit among the men and in developing them mentally while in camp devens  pp  between  and  campbells reputation had grown from statewide and regional to national her services as a consultant for library work with immigrants were in demand not only by smallto medium sized libraries in the northeast but also by large urban library systems in cities serving immigrant communities in the midwest notably detroit and cleveland during her consultation work in cleveland she met a fellow activist and cultural pluralist in eleanor edwards ledbetter librarian of the broadway branch of the cleveland public library who would in the s through s chair the ala committee on work with the foreign born campbells reputation as a consultant and her acquaintance with john foster carr founder of the immigrant public society of new york city an ala employee during world war i and first chair of the ala committee on work with the foreign born ala cwfb were undoubtedly factors in her appointment in  to the ala cwfb one of the few committees to survive the failed ala enlarged program which had hoped to carry on successful programs initiated by the ala library war service the ala cwfb had been established in  at the end of world war ii to raise the national consciousness on the rights and needs of immigrants for library service campbell served for two years on the committee  pp     more national recognition of campbells work in passaic came in  with the publication of john danielss america via the neighborhood daniels a member of the carnegie corporation of new yorks task force on americanization was responsible for identifying the most successful social agencies and organizations including public libraries in the campaign to americanize the immigrant daniels discovered that the most successful libraries were those extending their influence beyond the walls of the library into the community successful librarians were those who conceive the library as an organic part of the community which may be not only a place of books but a general center with a broadly educational motive daniels applauded her service in passaic as a convincing demonstration of how libraries could cooperate with the immigrant community to affect its americanization in her introduction to the republished edition of danielss study florence g cassidy pointed out that his study exemplified sanity and objectivity in the midst of the strident voices and confused utterances of the period  p vii  by the time danielss words appeared in print campbell had already applied the same methods initiated in passaic at the state level in massachusetts in  campbell at the age of fifty two was in the throes of a midlife crisis brought on by the constant travel and numerous speaking engagements and was disappointed that her salary with the mfplc had not been increased throughout her seven year tenure she shared her concerns with family members in virginia and west virginia  in september  relatives in roanoke virginia wrote her about a position in lynchburg the jones memorial library in lynchburg virginia was searching for a director upon notification of the opening campbell forwarded to the search committee her credentials for consideration and explained why she would desire to leave the security of her position with the mfplc for the uncertainty of an underdeveloped library situation in rural virginia she mentioned that she looked forward to the planning and launching of an institution as powerful in its educational and moral effect as a great public library can become   p  her letter contrasted the new challenge with her former one of jogging up already established libraries as she had been doing in massachusetts it was apparent from her letter that she wanted to return to virginia where she had been raised in her early years she would be near relatives in charles town west virginia and roanoke virginia campbells sister anne campbell waterman was to settle later in port royal virginia in  the colonial williamsburg restoration would attract her nephew thomas tileston waterman a nationally recognized architect and architectural historian  having made up her mind campbell had to resign formally she was resolute in her decision to leave boston effective december   for lynchburg even the possibility of an increase in salary which was offered was not sufficient to dissuade her  the responses from her colleagues on the mfplc as well as librarians trustees leaders of the immigrant communities and new americans across the state expressed their collective concern that campbell would be impossible to replace  in the official announcement of campbells resignation which appeared in the mfplc  annual report belden assessed the impact of campbells contribution to library work with immigrants throughout massachusetts by recognizing that under her able leadership the educational work in libraries for aliens attained a high standard   it would be  before edna phillips was hired to replace campbell as supervisor of work with racial groups phillips in the  and s would chair the ala committee on work with the foreign born by  campbell had completed the first year of her twenty five year tenure as director of the jones memorial library in lynchburg virginia it is ironic that campbell left behind her in massachusetts and the northeast large immigrant populations still coming into the united states from southeastern europe russia and the middle east the new immigration would soon be greatly reduced by new congressional legislation from  to  the resulting  national origins act would be based on a quota system which had been recommended much earlier in  with the publication of the report of the  federal immigration commission  pp   community library service in lynchburg in lynchburg campbell transferred her advocacy to the improvement and extension of library services to working class southerners many of whom because of the color of their skin had suffered the same prejudices and discrimination as northerners who did not speak english the problem that plagued liberal librarians in the south was the legal segregation of african americans from participation in private and public facilities including public libraries segregation was the result of the souths interpretation of the plessy v ferguson ruling of the us supreme court in  which set the precedent that separate was equal it would be  before the supreme court finally struck down the  ruling deciding unanimously in brown v topeka board of education that separate was inherently unequal  from  to  a hopeless and un american situation was imposed upon liberal librarians in the south who knew in their hearts and from their library training and education the imperative to offer equal service a vision that was still not fulfilled in the south with the acceptance of the  ala bill of rights as in newark passaic valhalla and boston campbell set about in lynchburg to demonstrate the ability of the library to keep our community happy and good natured even if we cannot hope to reform the universe  p  the board of trustees had ordered that the hours for the jones memorial library should be from  am to  pm but campbell always insisted that the library be opened each morning at  am under her administration the jones memorial library made marked progress according to the lynchburg news on july   campbells coming to lynchburg was fortuitous to the city and the jones memorial library she oversaw structural alterations within the main building and the landscaping of the grounds  p  campbell emphasized childrens work adult education readers advisory services and the beginnings of library work with african americans her work with african americans must be viewed in the context of jim crow laws in the south that made integration of libraries schools and other educational agencies illegal shortly after her arrival in lynchburg in  she inaugurated a program of sending truckloads of books from the jones memorial library to various public schools including the segregated african american high school which continued to be of great assistance in classroom instruction the first branch library was established at fort hill club in  the dunbar branch for african americans at the segregated high school for african americans was set up in november  campbell appointed african american poet anne spencer librarian of the dunbar branch spencer was instrumental in establishing the lynchburg chapter of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp j lee greene in his biography of poet anne spencer times unfading garden describes spencers first day at the jones memorial library the day she met jane maud campbell although greene does not identify the librarian she was definitely jane maud campbell greene recounts that spencer in early december  showed the librarian her copy of james weldon johnsons the book of american negro poetry  which contained five of her poems the librarian was impressed with spencer and her poetry soon afterwards the board of trustees for the private white jones memorial library met and decided to hire anne spencer to work at a branch of jones to be set up in the black dunbar high school  p  anne spencer was known about lynchburg as a social heretic an epithet that could have been applied equally to campbell greene illuminates the situation for african americans in virginia in the s by paraphrasing data for  contained in monroe n works negro year book  which listed twenty one public libraries for african americans located in the south the east and the midwest three were in the virginia cities of norfolk roanoke and lynchburg greene concluded that since lynchburg made the list one can imagine the shortcomings of other public libraries for blacks at this time for in  the library for blacks at dunbar was more name than fact  p  a third branch was started later at robert e lee junior high school the dunbar and the robert e lee junior high branches were later taken over by the public school system campbell thus worked along the fringes of the segregation laws by making sure that basic albeit minimal library resources and services were available to african americans living and working in lynchburg and that talent and potential such as that possessed in abundance by anne spencer was recognized spencer left her duties at dunbar by  shortly before the death of campbell  pp    encouraging the donation of maps views and papers documenting lynchburgs history campbell acquired a collection of the works of virginia authors making the jones library a resource for scholars of virginia history literature and genealogy the jones memorial library a privately endowed white library but functioning as the public library of lynchburg eventually boasted an outstanding collection of virginiana considered one of the most complete aside from the well known collections at the university of virginia and the state library of virginia in richmond living in lynchburg suited campbell her lynchburg dutch colonial house on greenway court was one of her nephew tom watermans earliest commissions for a new dwelling his work being mainly in restoration custom designed for her way of life her house gave her constant pleasure once having put her roots down in lynchburg she never again traveled to old holiday haunts like ogunquit maine she shared her home generously with house guests dinner guests and as a second home for her great nieces janet and fay reed daughters of campbells sister georgia waterman reed while they were at randolph macon womans college in the s the jones memorial library acquired a limousine and chauffeur to help campbell to make her rounds of branches trustees offices and civic meetings including for example a series of meetings in which she worked with other city officials on plans for a city war memorial when campbell was in her sixties she decided to economize by getting a drivers license so that she could drive herself kaynor remembers her aunt maudie coming to randolph macon womans college to pick up her sister janet and her for a weekend visit my classmates and i would know she was coming when we saw a big black limousine careening down the wrong side of rivermont avenue this became a familiar enough sight so that local people driving to work simply hugged the curb for the few nerve shattering moments while the library limousine was in their range  p   a special meeting of the newly organized virginia library association vla was held in richmond on november   to appoint a committee to formulate a plan that would embody the ideas of the virginia library association vla in response to the report of the commission to survey the educational system of virginia in april  on the first page of the first volume of virginia libraries the official journal of the vla was an announcement of the formation of this statewide committee chaired by j maud campbell of the jones memorial library in lynchburg the committees charge was to formulate a plan which would embody the ideas of the association as to the stimulation formation and support of libraries  pp  later in this same article dr e g swem was mentioned as being vla president campbell was certainly one of the first presidents of the virginia library association perhaps succeeding dr swem for in the october  issue of virginia libraries she was referred to as a former vla president  throughout the s the jones memorial library was recognized as a research source beginning in  with its inclusion in the ala committee on resources of southern libraries summary of information on southern research libraries in  the library was cited by harry clemons in a survey of research materials in virginia libraries  along with those in richmond norfolk roanoke petersburg winchester and newport news as being effective public libraries in  robert bingham downs includes the jones memorial library in the  resources of southern libraries a survey of facilities for research   p   kaynor recalled that in the s s and s a visitor to lynchburgs jones memorial library nearly always encountered head librarian maudie campbell you climbed the long flight of steps and paused to view the city from the portico before entering  inside the head librarian exemplifying thriftiness frequently was taking a turn at the front desk in the grand spaces of the jones miss campbell looked startlingly petitebut never insignificant the white hair piled on top of her head and her ramrod posture told you that she was in command her sharp eyes smiled a welcome but lost no time drawing out your errand  p  campbell in weakened health decided after twenty five years service to the jones memorial library to retire as of january   when announcement of her resignation was made james owen watts chairman of the board expressed his personal regret and that of other members about a week later a lynchburg newspaper reported that a community loss had occurred on thursday january   referring to campbells resignation the editor wrote that different patrons will miss miss campbell for different reasons those interested in the history of virginia will miss her informed discussions and helpful commentary on the fine virginiana collection she has acquired for the library and her ability to direct the searcher for information to other places where rare volumes could be found  a librarian in a community such as this learns to know it as do few of its citizens and if as fine a one as miss campbell exerts quietly but surely a very large cultural influence upon the city we wish for miss campbell much happiness in her retirement happiness of the kind which she has in large measure enabled others to have through the medium of the books she selected for them and in the manner of their dispensation may she for many years continue in her capacity of citizen to exert the good influence that has marked her presence with us since  simply through continued residence as a fine citizen in this community and so in large measure compensate for her absence from the library  although her resignation was to have been effective january  she continued to serve through february  at the request of the board of trustees and after that time was confined to her home between the date of her formal resignation and the date of her death was a little less than three months jane maud campbell died april   at the age of seventy eight at her home with her at the time of her death was her niece georgia waterman reed of springfield massachusetts who was like a daughter to maud campbell in addition to georgia reed campbell was survived by a brother robert campbell of buffalo a number of nieces and nephews in this country including her nephew tom waterman of washington dc two great nieces janet and fay reed daughters of georgia waterman reed both students at randolph macon womans college and two nieces a great nephew and a great niece in england trustees and staff members of jones memorial library through respect to miss campbell announced that the main library and fort hill branch would be closed all day saturday the day of the funeral with burial in spring hill cemetery lynchburg  campbell was remembered for her contributions toward making the library a popular place for many classes of readers and toward building in the community an appreciation of the value of books and of their study  another obituary revealed her dedication to her profession her personal wit and charm her general knowledge and her humanitarianism to the members of the board of trustees and the staff she was more than a librarian she personified the institution she was an interesting and charming friend ready with her wit directness and fund of knowledge to contribute to any subject of conversation her never failing loyalty to the best interests of the library as well as her ability to remember items of personal interest endeared her to her associates  researching maud campbells long and distinguished career awakened interest among her surviving family notably her great niece fay campbell reed kaynor who kept all of her aunts papers and eventually donated them to the arthur and elizabeth schlesinger library on the history of women in america at radcliffe college harvard university campbells papers document her activities as a librarian whose interests spanned from library work with immigrants to adult immigrant education to service on state commissions on immigration to community library service  campbell was above all someone who understood how difficult it was to be different in a world that demanded uniformity she left her indelible mark on multicultural librarianship by awakening the social consciences of librarians to the need for books and reading for all regardless of legal status socioeconomic status race or creed and by pushing public libraries to be truly democratic institutions for the public
