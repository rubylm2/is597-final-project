icreating space at the table intellectual freedom can bolster diverse voices shannon oltmann abstract many of the most challenged books year after year feature voices from diverse communities including those of women racial or ethnic minorities and lgbt people intellectual freedom protects these voices and protects our right to hear these voices this essay discusses the definition of intellectual freedom why diverse perspectives are important and how intellectual freedom can bolster diverse voices in turn this can improve our relationships with one another increasing empathy and respect which can be reflected in numerous ways and is particularly important in a divisive political climate ntellectual freedom is commonly seen as a core value of librarianship in the united states and is in fact formally included as one by the american library association ala sometimes its meaning and application are assumed rather than made explicit in this essay intellectual freedom is clearly defined and articulated then discussed in relation to diverse books this discussion illuminates the importance of intellectual freedom not just for libraries but also for our democracy as a whole especially when politics are divisive defining intellectual freedom perhaps the most commonly used definition comes from the ala which defines intellectual freedom as the rights of library users to read seek information and speak freely as guaranteed by the first amendment ala c par  elsewhere ala explains that intellectual freedom is the right of every individual to both seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction it provides for free access to all expressions of ideas through which any and all sides of a question cause or movement may be explored ala d par  see also oltmann b both scholars and practitioners reiterate the foundational core nature of intellectual freedom gorman  harkovitch hirst and loomis  knox  morrissey  oltmann a b in addition research has shown that librarians rely on these conceptions of intellectual freedom in their daily work knox  oltmann alibrary quarterly information community policy vol  no  pp    by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
creating space at the table  the principle of intellectual freedom for patrons is elaborated and strengthened in the library bill of rights and the accompanying official interpretations and in the code of ethics and other related statements wiegand  cohen and minow  dresang  within the library environment intellectual freedom is most commonly associated with freedom in reading the right to seek out and read whatever one desires however intellectual freedom also extends to viewing listening to and using library materials in other ways this can be seen in the library bill of rights the first second and fifth precepts in particular are relevant i books and other library resources should be provided for the interest information and enlightenment of all people of the community the library serves materials should not be excluded because of the origin background or views of those contributing to their creation ii libraries should provide materials and information presenting all points of view on current and historical issues materials should not be proscribed or removed because of partisan or doctrinal disapproval    v a persons right to use a library should not be denied or abridged because of origin age background or views ala f par  according to these fundamental principles of librarianship there should be no ideological test for acquisitions and anyone should be able to view read or use anything in the library these principles apply not only to books but to all library materials both the library bill of rights and the definitions of intellectual freedom are expansive meant to address various possible situations concerns and challenges for example people may wonder if children have intellectual freedom rights this is clearly articulated in the second precept quoted above which explicitly includes age as a factor that should not be taken into consideration the ala extends the applicability of the library bill of rights and by implication the definition of intellectual freedom through its interpretations of the library bill of rights ala e these  statements explain how the library bill of rights applies to diverse issues such as meeting rooms rating systems privacy academic libraries expurgation and diversity the interpretations provide explicit guidance as to how to enact intellectual freedom in libraries intellectual freedom is often raised to counter censorship or is positioned as the opposite of censorship the ala d defines censorship as the suppression of ideas and information that certain personsindividuals groups or government officialsfind objectionable or dangerous par  if censorship is the suppression of ideas then intellectual freedom is the expression and protection of ideas according to the ala censorship occurs when expressive materials like books magazines films and videos or works of art are removed or kept
  the library quarterlyfrom public access ala d par  by contrast intellectual freedom ensures access to these expressive materials it is worth noting that intellectual freedom does not imply endorsement of all ideas contained in a libraryrather the focus is on access to the ideas this is why libraries generally oppose challenges to library materialsthat is the inclusion of certain items in the library see zimmer and mccleer  for a detailed description of a recent challenge challengers typically want an item removed from a library since  the office of intellectual freedom oif of the ala has collected data voluntarily submitted by libraries about book challenges between  and  the latest year for which data are available an average of  books were challenged per year according to the oif many challenged books are childrens books young adult books and classics ala b book challenges and diversity across all years and within the various categories diverse books are frequently challenged here diverse books are those with diverse characters or with plots driven by diversity as the oif describes this includes non white main andor secondary characters lgbt main and or secondary characters disabled main andor secondary characters issues about race or racism lgbt issues issues about religion which encompass in this situation the holocaust and terrorism issues about disability andor mental illness non western settings in which the west is north america and europe ala a par  author malinda lo  has also examined this issue and she described diverse books as those by and about people of color lgbt people andor disabled people par  although these are imperfect conceptions of what constitutes diverse books these definitions provide useful starting points for discussion about diversity in books preliminary data indicate that diverse books are disproportionately challenged in libraries to examine this claim we need three pieces of data the percentages of the us population of us books or authors and of challenged books that are categorized as diverse these percentages are difficult to obtain to simplify these calculations we will focus on racial and ethnic minorities in  non hispanic white persons constituted approximately  of the total us population us census bureau nd meaning that  of the us population could be categorized as racial or ethnic minority including hispanic there are no extant data about the percentage of books in the united states written by nonwhite authors or more broadly the percentage of books that qualify as diverse however several indications suggest the number of authors of color is low author roxanne gay  examined book reviews in the new york times in  and found that  of the reviewed books were written by white authors a speculative fiction magazine fireside fiction examined at this time the oif collects information about book challenges only not about challenges to other types of materials

  the library quarterlywhy diverse library resources matter diversity in books matters for several reasons as articulated in the literature most scholarship focuses on children and teens in this context but diversity in reading material arguably benefits adults as well diverse library materials act as both windows and mirrors bishop  glazier and seo  smolkin and young  as mirrors diverse library materials allow people from diverse communities to see themselves reflected in what they are reading for example lgbt youth often suffer from isolation and uncertainty about their sexuality and their acceptance by friends and family reading about teens with similar experiences can provide support and encouragement this creates opportunities for individuals to reflect on their own experiences and often to gain more self awareness and understanding it allows individuals to see themselves as part of the world they inhabit as a window diverse literature allows readers to gain insight into the experiences of others white individuals for instance may learn about the perspectives and situations of people of color increasing understanding and empathy those who are not members of multicultural or marginalized groups can benefit as diverse books help them understand and respect differences and diversity loh   jaime campbell naidoo  emphasizes that multicultural resources provide the opportunity to learn how to function in a culturally pluralistic world  the association for library service to childrens white paper about the importance of diversity notes that positive representations of diversity are important because they  provide positive role models for culturally diverse children  introduce children to characters with similar experiences and emotions  convey the richness and beauty of the diverse cultures in the united states  reinforce a distinct cultural identity  promote multilingual and literacy development  inspire learning of other cultures and general cultural knowledge  facilitate acceptance of cultures different from ones own and  foster global connections naidoo  these goals are echoed and expanded elsewhere for example virginia loh  notes that children of color need role models and positive representations which may increase selfesteem and self development  diverse books can help teens and others identify with their own cultures and develop an appreciation for the diversity that occurs both within and across racial and cultural groups hughes hassell   furthermore it can also encourage and empower diverse people to take action in their own lives and in the world around them 
creating space at the table  intellectual freedom advances diverse perspectives intellectual freedom as a principle and a mind set creates space for many voices to be present this happens in two ways first intellectual freedom acts as a bulwark against challenges which as we have seen disproportionately affect diverse books intellectual freedom is a core value of librarianship functioning as the bedrock of how and why librarians provide access to so much information in so many formats to so many people when any library material is challenged librarians turn to the principle of intellectual freedom to guide their decision making intellectual freedom provides a strong foundation from which to refute challenges to library material inclusion and to preserve access to many resources recall that the ala defines intellectual freedom as the right of every individual to both seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction ala d par  this serves as a mandate to have a wide range of views present bringing us to the second way that intellectual freedom bolsters diversity as a principle it encourages perhaps even requires the presence of diverse perspectives and voices intellectual freedom with its insistence that all voices be available implies that diverse books should be part of library resources if one does not have certain diverse viewpoints present is intellectual freedom really being upheld many libraries use the new york times books reviews to aid in their selection processes but by doing so they are likely overlooking many books written by nonwhite authors that simply are not being reviewed there gay  from this perspective intellectual freedom calls for more thorough and thoughtful selection processes going beyond the staid and traditional new york times perhaps blogs or other types of media written by nonwhite authors should be consulted additional work must be undertaken to ensure that diverse viewpoints are present intellectual freedom is the basis for such work intellectual freedom diversity and democracy having diverse perspectives represented in ones library can help fulfill the ideal of intellectual freedom but it does something further a diverse collection includes varied ideas and perspectives often introducing people to new perspectives and ideas they have not encountered previously research indicates that reading literary fiction in particular can increase empathy toward other people including those not like us stetka  oatley  new ideas open new possibilities for people for example a book with a disabled protagonist may enable readers to better understand the situations faced by persons with disabilityleading in turn to more empathy and respect operating from a position of increased empathy and respect can influence peoples decisions in their daily lives and in larger arenas such as the voting booth a person may reflect on what he or she has learned through reading diverse materials and act on this reflection a person may make different suppositions about individuals of different races including seeing them
  the library quarterlyperhaps for the first time as individuals rather than as stereotyped monoliths a person may engage in constructive dialogue with others reaching across categories of diversity to connect share and learn a person may be spurred to vote differently taking into account the diverse perspectives he or she has encountered reading about the struggles of those in a lower socioeconomic class for example may lead to voting for changes that would ease not increase their burdens this could mean voting for policies that lower tax rates that improve government housing that are not punitive with respect to welfare that provide job training assistance and so on developing empathy and respect for others allows people to see beyond their own experiences and knowledge such empathy and respect may be particularly important in the current political climate the  presidential campaign was marked by divisive rhetoric fostering an us versus them mentality emily mills  argued that trump is doing that now with several groups of people all others that good god fearing white americans are supposed to now fear and loathe and blame for all of their problems par  this stance othering those who are different is only possible when one has not known those others one way of knowing is through reading and learning about diverse perspectivesalthough reading alone should not be the end of learning but rather a scaffold to further learning and interaction references ala american library association a defining diversity httpwwwalaorgbbooksdiversity ala american library association b frequently challenged books httpwwwalaorgbbooks frequentlychallengedbooks ala american library association c intellectual freedom httpwwwalaorgadvocacy intfreedom ala american library association d intellectual freedom and censorship qa httpwwwala orgadvocacyintfreedomcensorshipfirstamendmentissuesifcensorshipqanda ala american library association e interpretations of the library bill of rights httpwwwala orgadvocacyintfreedomlibrarybillinterpretations ala american library association f library bill of rights httpwwwalaorgadvocacyintfreedom librarybill bishop rudine s  mirrors windows and sliding glass doors perspectives choosing and using books for the classroom    ccbc cooperative childrens book center  publishing statistics on childrens books about people of color and firstnative nations and by people of color and firstnative nations authors and illustrators httpccbceducationwiscedubookspcstatsasp cohen henry and mary minow  intellectual freedom in libraries then and now advances in librarianship  dresang eliza t  intellectual freedom and libraries complexity and change in the twenty first century digital environment library quarterly    ehrlich hannah  the diversity gap in childrens publishing  lee and low books blog march  httpblogleeandlowcomthe diversity gap in childrens publishing
