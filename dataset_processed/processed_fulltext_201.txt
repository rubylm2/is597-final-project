the development of libraries in mexico fernando penalosa i a rcheological remains indicate the existence of a rudimentary form of library in prehistoric mexico some seven thousand years ago members of a mongoloid race inhabited the valley of mexico and left to posterity a library of books carved in stone dealing with myths stars or architectural designs this library was completely covered by a flood of lava and ashes from a near by volcano and preserved until this century in a suburb of mexico city the next available evidence of library activity occurs in the aztec civilization of historic times in  the conquering spaniards found large collections of hieroglyphics relating the results of scientific experiments or treating historical and religious topics these libraries largely of an archival nature were located in the temples and were under the supervision of the priests the conquest ended by destroying aztec civilization and with it the aztec libraries and archives the spaniards were not long however in filling the cultural void missionaries came to proselyte and to educate and a thin veneer of european civilization was imposed upon the country the clergy were the intellectual leaders in this movement at their instigation the first printing press was established in mexico in  by juan pablos other presses were soon set up and books and official reports were printed on them although the civil and religious authorities placed numerous obstacles in the way of those desiring to import books to the colony libraries were rapidly formed in schools convents government offices and private homes the majority of the books in the colonial libraries dealt with ecclesiastical or philosophical subjects heretical or liberal works were excluded the books were shelved in alphabetical order by author and a special mark of ownership was branded into the binding of each volume under penalty of excommunication it was forbidden to take books from monastic libraries without permission of the superiors fray juan de zumarraga first bishop and archbishop of mexico who possessed a large private library was generous in donating books to various monastic establishments in  he sent to the council of the indies a report calling attention to the need for good libraries in the colony three years later an augustinian friar alonso de la veracruz established in the convent of san agustin in mexico city the first semipublic library in the new world according to the chronicler fray juan de grijalva he set up in the college   a distinguished library which the year before  he had brought from spain and assembled as he himself says from various places and universities where there were books of all the faculties and of all the known arts and languages the original collection consisted of sixty boxes of books to which this great man added all those which came to his attention and were not in the library he adorned the library with maps celestial and terrestrial globes astrolabes prayer  mexican library  years old literary digest lxxxii july     juan b igufniz el libro epitome de bibliologfa mxico editorial porrcia  p

development of libraries in mexico  camacho   and miguel aleman   popular library service was expanded somewhat but faced with growing industrialization the federal government has paid increasing attention to libraries of a less popular nature the department of libraries in addition to its other duties co operates with certain government supported libraries including the library of social sciences established in  the library of the ministry of education much used by students and teachers and the cervantes library established in  the cervantes library is the only mexican library occupying a building constructed especially for library purposes most of its books are reference materials and  per cent of its patrons are students using books for school purposes it has a special children section and a periodical department another important public library in the mexican capital is the ibero american and fine arts library which was founded in  with a collection of fifteen thousand volumes mostly concerning the literature and arts of mexico and of other spanish american countries something new in mexican library service was created on march   when the national periodicals library was inaugurated in the remodeled san pablo y san pedro church this collection of newspapers and magazines is a department of the national university and was formerly located in the department of newspapers and magazines that was formed in  in the national library the materials of the periodicals library are for reference use only and are not cataloged the library has thirty thousand bound volumes and about ten thousand others ready for binding it also has a department of iconography which contains collections of postage stamps maps reproductions and engravings although it is housed in an old church it has ample quarters and an attractive well lighted interior another important recent development was the establishment in  of the library of mexico the noted scholar jose vasconcelos left the directorship of the national library to accept the post as director of the new library it is located in the spacious quarters of an old fortress in the capital known as la ciudadela the citadel which was used as an arms factory during the past war the library is growing rapidly under an efficient and forward looking administration and is actually becoming the closest to a real public library in the american sense that mexico has besides the library promotion carried on by the federal government the government of the federal district has established its own system of popular libraries as part of its educational program the federal district has a union catalog of the books in the libraries under its jurisdiction and maintains a system of interlibrary loans by  fourteen libraries had been established and a dozen more were planned each with book stock ranging from eight hundred to two thousand the people in the various towns are enthusiastic about the libraries and in  two hundred delegates mostly peasants or workers from various localities of the district attended a library conference in mexico city townspeople have co operated with the government of the federal district and with the national government in the establishment and administration of local popular libraries one good example of this is the small library established in the town of san salvador cuauhtenco in an isolated rural area in the federal district even though many of the  inhabitants of

development of libraries in mexico  come from local initiative as in the past further support must be forthcoming from the federal and state governments but prerequisite to more support is an enlightened public opinion in regard to library needs and possibilities the only group capable of enlightening the public and influencing the government are the mexican librarians themselves they are a generally well informed and progressive group but they are few in number and are not organized into a national association american trained librarians in the mexico city college library library of mexico cervantes library and elsewhere are exceedingly few less than a dozen in all these will have to be the leaders in a modern mexican library movement but they will be able to do little until their numbers increase mexico is in desperate need of trained librarians but the mexican system of education for librarianship is grossly inadequate for the requirements of modern libraries the first course for librarians was opened in  in the national library other courses were offered in  and  the national library school under the auspices of the ministry of education has functioned since  its curriculum strongly emphasizes historical bibliography languages and cataloging and paleography the library curriculum at the women university places more emphasis on cultural subjects and less on library techniques when mexican library courses cease to emulate the pcole des chartes and are organized with greater attention to mexican needs a great forward step will have been taken mexico is on the threshold of a great modern library movement and when there are enough trained librarians they may be depended upon to help in promoting the library services which mexico so urgently needs
