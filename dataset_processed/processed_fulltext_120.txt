from our readers    i would like to add my protest to others you may have received about the treatment of donald o case and john v richardson very fine research study  predictors of student performance with emphasis on gender and ethnic determinants jelis winter  as expressed in the letter from ucla faculty in the fall  issue o√≠ jelis i have reread the article very carefully several times and can find no indication of racial or ethnic bias what is most distressing to me about the letter implicit tone of disassociation with case and richardson is that these professors are two of the most conscientious researchers in our field moreover their findings confirm much published research on the subject of diversity in higher education see for example andrew hacker affirmative action the new look the new york review of books october   to charge case and richardson with  acist statements none of which are specified also discredits the referee process of jelis and in a larger sense indicts the  racism of library schools all of whom are struggling desperately to recruit students and faculty from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds having been through the jelis process of review i am fully aware of the painstaking care exerted by referees and serving on two race and gender committees at my university i am also aware of the effort required to keep discussion of  iversity issues on a constructive rather than a defensive or paranoiac plane disclaimers such as the one authored by the ucla faculty do not further the goals of objective research or multicultural dialogue if by that we mean the open sharing of all ideas research findings and opinions it is ironic that after the researchers have exerted so much effort to follow exacting statistical and analytical procedures to ensure the validity of their findings they should then be redressed for unfelicitous turns of phrase i am mystified as to which turns of phrase those could have been however ucla faculty is one of the most stellar in the country has the diversity of california made its citizens including students and faculty so thin skinned that professors must now be subjected to a white scare i am fully aware of asking this question as a white male southerner working in the south and no doubt anything i say may be discounted on that basis alone it is foolish to assume that alignment with any minority cause will ensure political correctness who dares claim a place of honor at the bottom of the social order these days everyone in america belongs to some sort of minority even white anglosaxon protestant male educators there is no longer a sense of popular consciousness which expresses the will of the people   educators and the professoriate in particular have had to fight hard for academic freedom in the past decade due to an extremely conservative political climate what then is to be gained by disunity in faculty ranks especially in the name of political correctness it would seem to be the better part of wisdom to protect the right of our colleagues to conduct and publish research even  volume  number 
from our readers    if we don like their findings or the way in which they phrase them wasn it voltaire who said i disagree with what you say but defend to the death your right to say it the question of case and richardson choice of politically incorrect phrases seems moot as i have not yet seen a dictionary with usage labels like pc or p ie few dictionaries dare identify gauche grammar any more much less impure political statements i doubt if there would be agreement among any given minority on what was a politically correct phrase anyway i remember one library historian being raked over the coals by a feminist historian in the mid s for his use of the word  adies in speaking of turn of thecentury female librarians thank heavens women studies specialists have moved on to more substantive equity issues in the s and s i am proud to be part of a department and school where i feel confident in the support of my colleagues i am sure any of them would privately dress me down within an inch of my life if i embarrassed the school but would defend me fearlessly if i became the object of outside attack this may be an advantage of working in a smaller university i look forward to hearing my students reactions to case and richardson article in my academic library course in the spring where we discuss the whole changing nature of the university environment read educational polemicists as politically diverse as dinesh douza paul goodman harold bloom and robert maynard hutchins and try to find just compromises not necessarily easy ones between educational elitism and educational anarchy it grieves me to think what pressure must have been exerted on the faculty to have triggered their letter to you i hasten to add that this letter is written in the spirit of one who has been burned both by his own liberalism and his own conservatism in the past and i wish to reaffirm my great admiration for ucla faculty at the same time neither case nor richardson deserves any reproach for what may be the best study of some factors in student performance to date it would seem that their article points to the need for radical reassessment of the standards by which educators evaluate students and their programs james v carmichael jr assistant professor department of library and information studies university of north carolina at greensboro i enjoy lois n upham column the standards connection but feel obligated to point out a misleading statement in the most recent edition jelis summerfall  as chair of the committee that is revising the thesaurus standard z  i was surprised not to see this standard listed among those being balloted p  col  since ms upham based her report on the april  issue of information standards quarterly and the thesaurus standard was sent out for ballot in may that is reasonable later in the same column however it is reported that the standard has been reissued and is available from niso for thirty dollars this statement gives the impression that the revision is complete and that the standard has been published the initial revision was sent out for comment only the second revision was distributed for ballot upham was quoting from a press release prepared at niso headquarters perhaps the title of the release thesaurus standard reissued gives the impression that the standard has been published but the text features the terms proposed standard and draft standard jelis readers may be surprised that there is a charge for a draft standard i have questioned this policy myself in the past but learned that it is necessary for niso to recoup the administrative winter
