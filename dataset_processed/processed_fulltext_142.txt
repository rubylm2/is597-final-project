a conceptual framework for the public library as a community learning center for independent study margaret e monroe public libraries in responding to growing interest in adult independent study are beginning to reexamine their role as community learning centers different kinds of learning centers emphasize priority on provision of materials collaboration with academic institutions and agencies through an independent study information and referral service a multimedia center supported by educational counseling and study guidance and a community task force approach which provides learning center services in the midst of community problem solving differences among learners learning situations and learning styles as well as in library resources and community programs will affect the evolution of any particular public library community learning center traditionally public libraries have been stimulated to develop new modes of client services when technology opens new opportunities or when social change makes clear that a gap exists between the user and the library films have led not only to new collections but also to program planning assistance by public libraries to community organizations the new urban populations have required not only new collections but new methods of delivering information services and outreach services and information center functions have evolved with new styles of interaction with library users the capacity to respond to opportunity and necessity is the survival skill of greatest significance in this era of fast paced change within the past fifteen years educational technology and economic necessity have combined to make continuing education on an independent study basis truly viable programmed texts audiotaped and videotaped lectures educational films of great variety packaged with workbooks and tapes into learning kits computer assisted instruction and a multitude of other combinations of media and electronic devices have begun to be utilized to supplement classroom instruction and to serve reasonably well in combination with more traditional forms of print materials for independent study   pp   independent study in its many forms and formats has emerged to meet the need for mastery of a rapidly changing technology and an ever augmented library quarterly vol  no  pp   c  by the university of chicago all rights reserved 
public libraries and independent study  and increasingly complicated body of knowledge the influence of these new forms of study is felt in basic education as well as in continuing education higher education is undergoing major changes in forms of instruction with nontraditional college degree programs relying on independent study and internships research projects teleteaching and other forms used by the academic adviser to construct a contract program with the individual student  in short the educational institution that grants degrees under these styles of instruction releases the student to learn at his own pace and assumes the role of counselor and provider of the resources of learning  pp   academic libraries acquire a new importance in serving the needs of the academic program under such plans and the counseling function as well as the provision of materials is often placed in the hands of the media specialists within the framework of the academic subject guidelines   such nontraditional forms of undergraduate education challenge public library service to the student only in the traditional ways of providing study materials to supplement the basic texts and related media provided by the campus institution and of providing the usual guidance to a student who chooses to use the public library as his study center for reading or for preparation of papers the forms of nontraditional study however that truly challenge the public library to assume a new role are those that rely upon exemption examination to confer credit equivalence the college level examination program clep  developed by the college entrance examination board ceeb enables students to demonstrate a level of competence based on earlier study independent reading or life experience academic institutions individually determine the acceptability of clep scores for advanced standing or for college credit clep offers the examinations but it cannot feasibly prepare the student to pass them the student must devise his own procedure for readying himself for the examinations here students may regularly turn to the public library as the basic support system for their degree oriented education but it is important to add immediately that such forms of independent study once generally available through the public library will be pursued as well by adults who wish merely to learn and who have no plan for nor reason to pursue degree programs in short the mere availability of learning materials organized in a study center and attractive in their presentation may begin to stimulate adults to use the public library as a learning center for independent study it is important to recognize that the phrase independent study has broad significance quite unrelated to the academic environment or degree programs which has been summed up in allen tough phrase the adult learning projects  based at the ontario institute for studies in education tough in  surveyed sixty six adults comprising factory workers mothers teachers white collar workers politicians and professors and found that their independent learning projects fell into six broad categories prepar

public libraries and independent study  make the public library a source of information on independent study opportunities throughout the community and a first point of contact for its users  would refer interested adults to an academic institution for academic counseling  would involve stocking the library with materials recommended for use in independent study programs books programmed texts tapes learning packages and  would require the use of the library information network and interlibrary loan system for special explorations developed by the student in the course of his study the public library and the academic institution involved would tend to develop a common plan as a basis for successful collaboration and would need to define clearly differentiated objectives for the two institutions finally the public library would be involved in the regular evaluation of the project in short the collaborative approach represents the public library commitment to a specific program of service to independent study as an equal partner with the academic institution but with a distinctive role a third position on the philosophic spectrum is marked by the public library which with an even more distinctly liberal or nontraditional view sees its role as an independent community learning center such an independent role would of course also encompass the conservative roles of provision of requested materials and of materials on requested subjects this role might also include the collaborative approach as part of its total program in this independent role the library may accept responsibility for stimulating widespread use of independent study programs for developing reading study guides beyond the programs of local academic institutions and for providing the facilities and special equipment as well as study materials needed for an independent community learning center such a center in a public library would house a rich collection of learning materials study programs learning kits multimedia packages films recordings videotapes adult learning games etc and would make them available with the record players tape recorders projectors computer consoles learning machines and reading and study space required for their adequate use it would provide guidance to adults who choose study independent of academic institution programs guidance in selection of subjects of a study program and of study materials guidance could be given on study skills and library use skills to independent students individually or in groups and could include the construction of planned reading study programs for them perhaps the most liberal or nontraditional philosophic position would require the library to identify the significant problem situations in the community and to activate learning through the use of library materials and library services to solve these problems in a community task force style whether the problems involved are the formulation of government policy the development of new industrial activity in the community breaking the barriers of racism in schools or churches or the creation of new roles for the retired adult the library could activate a community task force approach to learning
 the library quarterly and problem solving clearly the public library in using this task force approach to problem solving for the learning society would work collaboratively with governmental educational and social agencies and with organizations and citizen groups who share responsibility concern and resources for solving community problems while the community task force approach to public library service to independent learning falls outside the narrower sense of the term independent study as it is now coming to be understood it falls clearly within the library adult education role as envisioned by ralph a beals in  beals then an adult educator and only later a librarian and director of the new york public library defined the public library role in adult education as the infusion of authentic knowledge into the thinking and decision making of the community  it is the same philosophy that led the detroit public library to respond to the detroit race riots of  with an impressive exhibit on the races of mankind which thousands of detroiters viewed in solemnity during the month following the riots the community task force approach to library service to a learning society is a concept which incorporates the responsibility of the public library for bringing its resources skillfully to bear on decision making in the community at the right time and in the right way for impact there may well be other positions on the philosophic spectrum but the range is illustrated by these four provision of requested materials the collaborative approach to academic study programs the independent community learning center and the community task force approach to problem solving for each philosophic position there are different library goals these goals may be implemented by different sets of measurable objectives related to the particular public to whom the library programs of service in the community learning center are oriented for some libraries the move from conservative to liberal positions may prove to be less a move in philosophic commitment than phases of growth in the library developing program in support of independent study and the concept of a learning society dimensions of the learning process in conceiving itself as a community learning center the library must view its users in a variety of dimensions related to the learning process the level of educational attainment of the public to be served may determine the study methods and materials for achieving independent study goals the collection and service program serving not only the college graduate continuing education program but also the newly literate adult vocational study must be broad and varied a clear decision on the publics to be served in terms of levels of prior experience in formal education will clarify objectives programs and resource needs the learning situations in which members of the community engage include

 the library quarterly some conclusions public libraries of modest size as well as large ones with specialized staff can develop a learning center role for independent study determination of the role which the library can afford to play a decision on the special publics that will be served in independent study a search for the appropriate academic institutions with which to build a collaborative program and a judicious choice of the specific areas in which the public library might play an independent role these decisions made and embodied in a plan for action are feasible for even the smallest library economy of effort in a minimal program need not be in basic conflict with excellence of service reading guidance to be provided in a library unit lacking professional staff may be limited to prepackaged reading study guides reliance on national publicity for clep and related programs may simplify the library program of outreach a good referral service from the library to the academic institution for counseling may assure the adult student of good guidance informal assistance in the use of library resources and effective interlibrary loans would complete a minimal program at the collaborative level a highly developed program on the other hand would increase the initiative taken by the library in  reading study guide preparation by the library for the student  a program of local publicity and outreach to supplement and reinforce national publicity for independent study  training of staff in reading guidance and in the preliminary steps of academic counseling  group seminars and workshops on library skills and study skills as well as lecture discussion sessions on popular topics under study and  purchase of a wide range of materials and packaged learning programs to offer the richest possible basis for choice of study materials wisdom lies in doing the possible and doing it well poor planning may err either in the direction of a too ambitious program which fails community expectations or of a too modest aspiration which fails the community not for lack of resources but for lack of imagination the availability of such national programs as clep and of such statewide programs as new york empire college and new jersey thomas edison college provides great encouragement for public libraries to develop a support system of materials and guidance and to stimulate their use this is at least the first step toward a public library learning center for independent study in the learning society  references  carnegie commission on higher education he fourth revolution instructional technology in higher education new york mcgraw hill book co   commission on non traditional study diversity by design san francisco jossey bass inc
