anti communism racism and censorship in the mccarthy era the case of ruth w brown and the bartlesville public library louise s robbins to report on my research in progress i will first give a brief account of the case and its significance to the library and information profession then i will recount for you where the research has taken me thus far some discoveries i have made some questions that keep arising and where i go from here the case my research examines the case of ruth w brown long time librarian of the bartlesville oklahoma public library who was fired from her job in  following charges by a citizens committee that she had subversive periodicals in the library charges that masked actual concerns about brown personal views and professional actions concerning equal treatment of african americans the library board which had also been ousted friends of brown and friends of the library unsuccessfully challenged the legality of the action the oklahoma library association quickly put together an intellectual freedom committee to investigate the case and to give brown what support it could the inability of the american library association intellectual freedom committee to take prompt and effective action provided an impetus to increase the committee powers one of the most widely publicized library censorship cases of the s its major elements  anti communism racism and suppression or censorship  were prominent themes of the mccarthy era a time in which books or films that dealt with race issues were often attacked as communist propaganda a book length exploration of the intersection of these themes that played out in bartlesville will shed light on the motives of the censors of the s and perhaps illuminate what lies behind similarly ambiguous acts of censorship today it will also reveal how the library profession attempted to deal with a blatant attack on its credo of free access to information for all at a time when the profession was just learning to assert itself against challenges to intellectual freedom it will thus add both to the library history literature and to the literature concerning the ways in which professions define themselves by choosing their battles fall  
 journal of education for library and information science about the author louise robbins is assistant professor of library and information studies at the university of wisconsin madison this is an informal report on research in progress presented to alise february   progress i began my research in the american library association archives at the university of illinois with the papers of david k berninghausen ala intellectual freedom committee chairman in  at the university of minnesota a telephone call to jan sanders the bartlesville librarian gave me a connection to russell davis who was chairman of the ousted library board sanders also kindly copied the library file on ruth brown the contact with davis led to a wonderful discovery a few years earlier he had donated his file on ruth brown to the pittsburg state university library pittsburg kansas and ruth brown own papers were also located there a call to special collections librarian gene degruson gave me access to both sets of papers and put me in touch with ruth brown close friend margaret varvel varvel in turn confirmed the surprising information that ruth brown had two adopted daughters and gave me information that enabled me to locate them the file of materials from the bartlesville public library included one slightly inaccurate statement that suggested ruth brown had some connection to the congress on racial equality core this information sent me to the microfilm of the core papers at the state historical society of wisconsin library i had hoped to find ruth brown name on a membership list instead to my amazement i found a significant number of letters brown exchanged with core executive director george hauser from  until  the year after her firing the letters reveal that ruth brown dedication to equal rights was far greater than a reader of any of the published materials could have guessed in fact she attended core conferences and developed a commitment to non violent direct action that finally led her to go to a local drugstore with two africanamerican women teachers from bartlesville segregated douglass school and ask to be served well aware of the possible consequences she wrote hauser as early as  of her commitment to take action to help end segregation it might mean that i would no longer be bartlesville librarian but ie had that fun for thirty years anyway i have also discovered that when ruth lost her court fight to regain her bartlesville position she left bartlesville and went to be librarian at the all black piney woods country life school just south of jackson mississippl she left that position over differences with the authoritarian administration of the school her last professional years were spent at sterling colorado from which she wrote library journal in  to congratulate ala on finally taking a stand against segregation i have learned that the oklahoma library association formed an intellectual freedom committee specifically to investigate this case but that no public librarians in oklahoma were willing to serve on the committee anecdotal and circumstantial evidence suggest that ruth brown was the volume  number 
censorship in the mccarthy era  subject for the  film storm center for which the ala intellectual freedom committee served as consultant her friends certainly have that impression one quotes brown as saying it strange to be fat and sixty ish and see yourself played by bette davis certainly a new york times article by writer and director daniel taradash indicates that he got the idea for the film from newspapers in   and ruth was prominent in the newspapers unanswered questions what motivated ruth brown a white woman in her late fifties who had lived in oklahoma a jim crow state almost all of her life and who had no visible means of support other than her library position to take what was at the time such radical action we know that at least in part it was her reading what did she read neither ala nor the oklahoma library association confronted the race aspect of this case in their reporting is this because of the way the case was presented to them were they ignorant of the facts or were they simply unready or unwilling to deal with a case that was doubly controversial was the unwillingness of public librarians to be embroiled in the investigation of cases like ruth brown a reason for the slow development of permanent intellectual freedom committees in the states next steps i have not yet begun to look at ruth brown opponents who were members of such groups as the daughters of the american revolution the united daughters of the confederacy the american legion and pro america i have not yet looked at the involvement on both sides of the issue of phillips petroleum the major employer in bartlesville a company town i have also not yet looked at the library itself and how it compared its collection or services with comparable libraries in oklahoma or how the structure and responsibilities of the library board factored into the confrontation nor have i yet examined the impact of the censorship case and its attendant publicity on the library and the city especially on the african american community ruth brown is becoming more and more fascinating as i learn more about her it is entirely appropriate that research into her case should receive the research award bearing the name of jane anne hannigan because it is clear that ruth brown needs to be viewed from a feminist standpoint stay tuned for more references and notes  censorship in bartlesville a report of the oklahoma library association committee on intellectual freedom american library association bulletin  march     f kennedy and others to president and executive board oklahoma library association january   letter of transmittal accompanying report of the intellectual freedom committee of the oklahoma library association on the bartles ville public library item no  ruth w brown archive kansas collection pittsburg state university library pittsburg kansas  l robbins toward ideology and autonomy the american library association response to threats to intellectual freedom   phd diss texas woman university    fall
