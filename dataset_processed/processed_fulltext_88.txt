books on the frontier the extent and nature of book ownership in southern indiana   michael h harris abstract the quality of the cultural life of the american frontier has long been in dispute some historians argue that the frontier forced the pioneers to revert to a near barbaric stage while it divested them of all aspects of their former cultures others maintain with equal vigor that the society which developed on each frontier was very nearly a carbon copy of the settled areas further east and that the culture of americans had not been significantly altered by the frontier process most agree however that evidence testifying to the nature and extent of book ownership provides one means of measuring the progress of culture on the frontier this paper summarizes the results of an intensive study of this topic on the southern indiana frontier data were collected from a variety of sources but especially important were county probate records which often contained inventories indicating books owned by early indiana residents an examination of over  inventories located in sixteen southern indiana counties produced descriptions of more than  private libraries an analysis of these libraries shows that the pattern of book ownership was not startingly different from that revealed by similar studies of book ownership in the american colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries clearly books were not impossible to acquire in early indiana and a sizable proportion of the estates inventoried in the counties studied contained books most of the collections were small and narrowly religious in nature with larger libraries still tending toward the utilitarian however a small number of inventories were discovered which listed large numbers of books a few men those with both the means and the inclination built large and well balanced libraries on the indiana frontier the nature and extent of culture on america successive frontiers has long been in dispute some scholars argue that the first pioneers reverted to a near barbaric stage when they came into contact with the frontier that they divested themselves of all aspects of their former cultures that the westerner had reached in the words of arthur k moore the fateful conclusion that the experience of settling a garden provides better answers to the great questions about life and eternity than the collective wisdom of the founders of western civilization  p  in opposition to this view other scholars following the lead of frederick jackson turner  have stated their belief that the first pioneers were forced to grapple with a vicious natural environment and that in order to subdue their new wilderness homes they were forced to revert to a state of near savagery abandoning any thought of things cultural while they devoted all their efforts to solidifying their hold on the land later as conditions grew more settled society began a gradual ascent from this savage condition but this new society was not the same as that which the settlers had known prior to their encounter with the frontier for  this paper is drawn in part from my unpublished dissertation at indiana university  the research reported here was supported by a us office of education grant acknowledgment is due my advisers dr haynes mcmullen and dr donald carmony of indiana university dr anne painter of drexel and dr peter hiatt 
books on the frontier southern indiana  it had been altered by the frontier process  a third group of historians led by louis b wright argue that the society which developed in each ensuing west was very nearly a carbon copy of the society found in the more settled areas further east that culture was transplanted to each successive frontier nearly unchanged and that it had not been significantly altered by the frontier process  perhaps much of the disagreement can be understood as the result of rivalry between differing schools or interpretations of the american frontier experience another basis for debate lies in the nature of the evidence which often proves puzzling and contradictory and which has led even the most objective historians to varying conclusions finally there has been too little systematic study of the evidence thus the resolution of the debate would seem to rest partially at least on further examination of the evidence testifying to the extent and nature of culture on the frontier scholars have utilized a number of different sources of information in their attempts to resolve the essential questions surrounding cultural life on the american frontier but it is becoming increasingly popular to use evidence relating to the availability ownership and reading of books as a major indicator louis b wright nicely summarized this approach when he wrote the choice of books brought by the first settlers or imported as soon as they had established themselves in the wilderness provides a significant clue to their conception of intellectual and social values  p  richard wade in his the urban frontier echoed wright sentiment when he noted that since books form another integral part of the apparatus of learning and civilized living their number quality and availability evidence the cultural stature of these new communities  p  the significance of library and book history as an integral part of american cultural history seems to be generally accepted among intellectual historians in america some systematic studies of the nature and extent of book ownership and reading on the frontier have been made   pp    generally however most information on this subject is found buried in larger studies of the social and cultural history of the west    the authors of these studies have usually relied on book advertisements in newspapers as barometers of reading interests generalizations on this evidence are founded upon the assumption that booksellers must have known what the public wanted to buy and as a result chose to advertise those books that they knew would sell however studies that show any actual correlation between the availability of books and their sale or circulation in frontier areas are lacking it is possible that the book advertisements were really intended to stimulate interest in books that were not selling well or the bookstore owners may have promoted in their advertisements the kinds of books which they alone could supply feeling that it was not necessary to advertise the popular varieties of books available in general stores or perhaps the frequent failures of bookstores in the west are attributable to an inability on the part of their owners to judge accurately the reading tastes of their potential customers if any or all of these conditions existed it would mean that the assessment of the popularity
 the library quarterly of various books novels for instance based on newspaper advertisements might well be in need of revision contributing to this lack of studies is the fact that business records concerning the sale of books by the booksellers subscription book agents and book hawkers who operated on the various frontiers are very scarce library circulation records are almost completely absent while little can be learned of book sales on the frontier much can be learned about actual book ownership among pioneers from a widely available but generally overlooked source the estate inventories in county probate records as counties and their legal apparatus were founded throughout the west the new settlers were quick to establish probate courts statutes were passed in nearly every state in basically the same form and read that within ninety days of the death of a county resident a full and perfect inventory of his possessions was to be taken and that if his property was sold an account of such sales should be kept  these inventories often extremely detailed might list anything from a broken broom handle to the most valuable items such as horses guns and plows those responsible for the inventories also appraised the value of each item such inventories prove fascinating reading for those interested in the availability of books book ownership or the development of reading tastes for if the deceased owned any books at his death that fact is almost certain to appear in the lists my own investigations concerning book ownership among early settlers in the ohio valley have led me to agree with wright and wade when they argue that the evidence testifying to the extent of book ownership and reading provides one means of measuring the progress of culture on the frontier   these limited studies and other published research suggested the need for an indepth study of book ownership in one area during its frontier period southern indiana   was selected as a workable test case and an intensive study was made of some  estate inventories in order to provide answers to the following questions  what was the extent and nature of book ownership in southern indiana between  and  and  what titles or types of printed matter were most widely owned the probate records analyzed were drawn from sixteen indiana counties located south of the national road these were selected in an attempt to provide a geographical distribution care was taken to insure the selection of counties which were located on the major river routes such as the ohio and white rivers and a number of counties were chosen which were inland and devoid of major waterways further the counties included were populated as was most of the southern part of the state by a heterogeneous population representing a diversity of religious ethnic and economic backgrounds table  summarizes the sample and the most general results of the study of over  inventories examined  or  percent mentioned books the percentage of inventories mentioning books ranged from  percent in harrison county to  percent for lawrence county no attempt is made here to explain that range except to say that the area was settled by a heterogeneous group of people of the  inventories

books on the frontier southern indiana  washington johnston and richard price were all prominent lawyers however their collections unlike the collections of other professional men not discussed below were not narrowly professional in makeup and are presented here as examples of the large well balanced libraries built on the frontier by men who had the means and the inclination to do so posey who was to reach prominence in kentucky and indiana politics was born in fairfax county virginia on july    vol  p  during the revolutionary war he saw considerable action and retired as a colonel in  ten years later he was commissioned a brigadier general and joined wayne in the campaign against the indians that culminated in the battle of fallen timbers in  he resigned from the military a second time in  and moved to kentucky where he was elected to the state senate and in  was chosen speaker later he moved to louisiana where he was appointed us senator in  in  he was appointed by president madison as governor of the indiana territory to succeed william henry harrison in ill health he lived in jeffersonville which offered more satisfactory medical care than the territorial capital corydon when indiana entered the union in  he ran for governor but was defeated by jonathan jennings posey was in most respects selftaught and appears to have had a considerable interest in books in addition to gathering a large library he was active in the jeffersonville bible society and did much to distribute the scriptures among the poor and the needy of the territory  vol  p  posey estate was probated in  and was valued at more than   the library which constituted a major part of his personal estate ranks as one of the largest collections assembled in early indiana numbering some  titles in  volumes in addition to its size the library strikes one as being carefully selected to provide balance it had no particular strengths perhaps posey always the virginia gentleman sought to emulate his english counterpart in his bookcollecting efforts the english model required balance and as daniel boorstin points out the gentleman was permitted to be literate but dared not be bookish pedantry and the squint of the specialist were to be avoided like the plague  posey library contained a number of religious works for instance it had a  volume bible several volumes of sermons a dozen collections of hymns the confession of faith and discipline of the methodist church hervey meditations a collection of family prayers and a life of christ history and biography were also well represented historical works included a  volume set of hume history of england a history of the american revolution and goldsmith histories of england and greece biographies ranged from studies of washington philip of spain and louis xiv to charles v he also owned a set of plutarch lives and a  volume work entitled the british plutarch literary works are less plentiful but  some two dozen libraries uncovered in the course of this study are not discussed above they are narrowly professional collections owned by doctors and lawyers and their inclusion here would have distorted the statistical presentation for a discussion of the professional libraries see harris  chap   the books in posey library are listed in 
 the library quarterly nevertheless comprise a substantial portion of the collection included are a number of multivolume sets of essays an  volume set of shakespeare works  volumes of sterne works and  volumes of the works of pope posey interest in political and military affairs is evident in his library works such as a guide to the rights and priviledges of englishmen the rights of man jefferson notes on virginia peter porcupine and paine works testify to his interest in american politics in addition he owned  volumes of the journals of the house and  volumes of the state papers several works on military tactics and a volume of military exercises remind us of his record as a soldier a number of utilitarian items form what might be termed the miscellaneous portion of his collection included are an  volume encyclopedia several dictionaries works on medicine gardening surveying mathematics astrology and navigation finally one last book the catalogue of the washington library a local social library provided its owner with access to a second large collection of useful books another virginian general washington johnston general was his first name and not a military title was the owner of a library which ranked next to posey as one of the largest private collections located in the state prior to  johnston was born in culpepper county virginia near where george washington had lived for many years he moved west to vincennes indiana territory in  at the age of seventeen george wilson has summarized johnston extensive contributions to his adopted state he was the first postmaster of vincennes  the first lawyer in vincennes the organizer of the knox county bar association a member of the first territorial legislature elected april nd  a member of the first board of trustees of vincennes university adjutant general of indiana territory three times chairman of the borough of vincennes twice president judge of the court a member of the state legislature for several terms and during the seventh session was speaker of the house of representatives   in addition to these activities johnston was also a founder and active user of the vincenines library company compiler of one of the first collections of laws to be printed in the territory and a prominent mason   johnston record of service and interests suggests a man dedicated to the life of the mind as well as public service unfortunately no record of his formal education has come to light but an analysis of his speeches suggests that he read widely in history the classics and law  further evidence of johnston exposure to books can be drawn from the list of titles owned at his death general washington johnston died on october   and his sizable estate was inventoried on november   those responsible for taking the inventory were careful in their work and as a result their inventory provides a detailed list of the contents of johnston large library of over  volumes  johnston life is described in detail in   johnston library is listed in   there is one puzzling aspect of johnston life while none of his biographies mentions the fact it appears from contemporary evidence that he was in addition to his other occupations a general store owner or a bookseller the picture is unclear but on january   he sold  titles to the vincennes library company for  and on
books on the frontier southern indiana  like posey johnston owned more books relating to theology than any other subject in addition to the bibles one english and one french he owned some  religious works to aid the bible reader were reference works such as buck theological dictionary horne introduction to the study of the scriptures and adam clarke volume commentary on the old and new testaments also present were half a dozen collections of sermons and a number of well known doctrinal tracts such as the reverend john fletcher checks on antinomianism and robert owen opening speech and his reply to the rev alexander campbell in the recent public discussion in cincinnati to prove that the principles of all religions are erroneous and that their practice is injurious to the human race the religious portion of his library also included a number of popular historical and inspirational works such as john foxe book of martyrs josephus history of the jews and richard baxter saint everlasting rest johnston professional and political interests are amply evidenced in that part of his collection which might be classed as law he owned over half a dozen works on the practice of law as well as the declaration of independence the acts of congress acts and journals of indiana and a  volume set of the laws of indiana his library also contained a number of literary works in addition to subscribing to the spectator on a regular basis he owned the works of shakespeare milton sterne cervantes and virgil johnston appears to have been well read in history and biography the list of historical works in his library includes rollin popular ancient history in  volumes david ramsay history of the united states to  and a history of england biographies include lives of napoleon clay and weem best selling life of washington finally he also owned a book considered basic to a gentleman library plutarch lives johnston library seems to have been carefully planned to provide the same kind of balance found in posey collection for in addition to the works mentioned above it contained a number of reference works such as abel boyer english french dictionary and william nicholson  volume british encyclopedia or dictionary of the arts a number of texts such as lindley murray grammar works on medicine and several almanacs and gazetteers a third library which illustrates the nature of the large private collection on the frontier is that owned by richard p price very little biographical information is available on price it is known that he was a lawyer and that in  he was commissioned associate judge may   according to the minutes the board purchased of general washington johnston the following books for the prices thereto annexed viz rambler  vol   adventurer    denon travels    tookes catherine    volneys view  washingtons monuments of patriotism  duncans logic  lavater on physiognomy  essay on crimes  charms of literature    pp   further evidence of his bookselling activities appears in the form of an advertisement in the western sun vincennes july   which reads simply i have a number of good new books which i will sell cheap for cash
 the library quarterly of knox county his commission was renewed in  for seven years and he died in  possessed of an estate valued at   price library evidences much of the same kind of balance found in the collections owned by posey and johnston although he owned fewer religious titles and slightly more titles in the belles lettres and history categories one of the most noteworthy characteristics of the  libraries analyzed in the preceding pages is their emphasis on utility the hoosiers were not especially bookish and like their ancestors they tended to buy those works which cotton mather had recommended to an earlier generation as devout and useful books religious works describing god relationship with man and works tracing the path to eventual salvation were considered essential by many nineteenthcentury christians sectarian beliefs tended to influence the selection of many works on divinity but certain pious works weighed heavy on the book shelves of early hoosiers the bible was cited  times in the  book collections analyzed it is remarkable that so few of the collections contained this most popular work possibly the absence of bibles in many inventories stems from their value as cherished family heirlooms and record books the pioneers were in the habit of recording their genealogies in their bibles and sometimes used them as diaries for this reason they were often passed on to the children or other relatives when the owner death seemed imminent  numerous examples of bibles used as genealogies and diaries are extant in southern indiana and perhaps this theory explains the lack of bibles in many of the inventories examined for this study a further reason for their absence at least after  may have been a law exempting them from certain inventories however of some seventyfive inventories filed after  thirtythree contained bibles nearly  percent a companion piece to the bible in many pioneer homes was the hymnbook the one most frequently listed was written by england first significant writer of hymns the reverend dr isaac watts watts published his first collection of hymns in  and for over a century his works were the most popular sources of american hymnody  p  one further book the theological dictionary was important in those homes where serious bible study was a consistant and significant part of everyday life forty of the collections analyzed for this study contained such dictionaries by far the most popular was charles buck theological dictionary containing definitions of all theological and ecclesiastical terms an impartial account of the several denominations that have subsisted in the religious world remarkable transactions and events in ecclesiastical history and a biographical sketch of writers in theological science which was first published in  and went through numerous editions  vol  p  most people were satisfied to glean what little religious history they needed from the bible and theological dictionaries like buck however a considerable number also owned  or more of the popular religious histories of the day the works which ranked among the  most cited titles in the  libraries studied were josephus history of the jews and john foxe actes
books on the frontier southern indiana  and monuments of the church or as it was more commonly known book of the martyrs flavius josephus usually shortened to josephus was born in jerusalem in ad   and died some time between ad  and  his famous work antiquities of the jews which originally appeared in  books traces the history of the jewish people to the year ad  it was a work highly recommended to all who were interested in biblical history and it sold widely in the united states in a  volume translation by whiston  p  john foxe the famous martyrologist wrote his actes and monuments of the church about the middle of the sixteenth century first published in english in  it was an immediate success the tales of christian martyrdom emphasized the role of the roman church it enjoyed wide popularity in this country and no one can calculate the enormous influence of foxe descriptions of persecutions by catholics in keeping alive hatred of romanism in the breasts of american protestants  p  the purposeful nature of the books purchased by early hoosiers is further illustrated by the large number of items intended to aid in the instruction of youtlh grammars arithmetics geographies and readers abound in the inventories in addition to these works many a small family library contained a language dictionary thirty of the  language dictionaries cited were copies of john walker critical pronouncing dictionary and exposition of the pnglish language which first appeared n  while hoosier pioneers often brought nly the most utilitarian of books they it the same time displayed the aversion for farm books that characterized the rural people throughout the nation    almost none of the libraries contained works written intentionally is aids for the farmer another significant characteristic of the book collections studied was their conservative nature the books most often owned were those tried and true titles that the settlers had known in the east but to say that the book collections found in the homes of the early settlers of southern indiana were conservative and purposeful does not mean that there were no works of pure entertainment among them certainly the majority of the libraries studied here contained very few books which could be termed belles lettres nevertheless nine of these libraries contained the works of shakespeare and many of the popular english poets are also represented one fact that does emerge from an analysis of the belles lettres found in private libraries in southern indiana is the almost total neglect of novels and more specifically american novels jane porter scottish chiefs is cited five times sterne tristam shandy is found in three libraries as is cervantes don quixote half a dozen other english novels including fielding tom jones and smollett roderick random are cited once each not a single novel by sir walter scott was located in the  libraries although his lady of the lake was cited once the only american novel listed was hugh henry brackenridge modern chivalry which was  that best seller list would read as follows out of  book collections analyzed the bible appeared  times dictionaries were cited  times hymnbooks were cited  times arithmetics were cited  times josephus history of the jews and foxe actes and monuments were each listed  times
 the library quarterly listed twice the hoosier pioneers evidently were not impressed by the pleas of the literary nationalists who called for support of american literary works of course no one can say with certainty that the absence of novels from the inventories means that the individuals involved did not read such works some of the early settlers in southern indiana like posey had access to local subscription libraries which often owned novels     it is also possible that the novels were read so often and so avidly that they were worn out before their owner death conclusion the findings of this study do not support the thesis of those scholars who argue that america pioneers abandoned books and reading for a primitivistic existence in nature garden nor does this study support the turner thesis for the hoosier pioneer library does not reflect an imaginative individualistic or particularily american character instead the analysis presented above shows that the pattern of book ownership on the southern indiana frontier was not unlike that revealed by similar studies of earlier american frontiers a sizable proportion of the estates inventoried contained books book collections were generally small conservative and purposeful theology was the subject most widely represented in the collections and the portion of the collections classed as belles lettres increased as the size of the collections increased clearly books were widely available in the homes of indiana first settlers of course the fact that a person owned a book does not necessarily mean that he read it but it does in a time when books were expensive and fairly difficult to acquire suggest his reading interests  the neglect of american authors is illustrated by the fact that the dictionary produced by america most fervent literary nationalist noah webster was listed in only two of the libraries analyzed while the dictionary prepared by the englishman john walker was located in thirty of the collections  actual records of the books borrowed from libraries in early indiana are scarce fielding beeler who lived in marion county as a young man kept a record of the books he borrowed from the county library in   david mcdonald a kentuckian transplanted to daviess county indiana remembered borrowing numerous books from the county library including the works of hume pope and swift and that mornings evenings and at noon when the horses were resting from the plough i devoured these volumes  p  novels were frequently checked out of the indiana state library by members of the legislative and executive branches of government a number of thick folio circulation books recording all loans prior to  are available in the indiana state library archives division the early settlers could and often did borrow books from one another there are occasional references in diaries to such practices evidence of such borrowing is also present in the numerous advertisements placed in local papers requesting the return of a borrowed book one such note read borrowed books the subscriber requests those persons who have borrowed books from him to return them as soon as their convenience will permit it was signed william henry harrison western sun vincennes july   for other examples see the recorder new albany october   the western censor indianapolis may   and the indiana journal indianapolis february   references  harris michael h the availability of books and the nature of book ownership on the southern indiana frontier  phd dissertation indiana university   moore arthur k the frontier mind a cultural analysis of the kentucky frontiersman lexington university of kentucky press   turner frederick jackson frontier and
