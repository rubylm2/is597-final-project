  journal of education for library and information science in this article we report the major findings of the evaluation of library services to older adults at three public libraries in maryland along the way we aim to emphasize that older adults are not a homogenous user group but rather have diverse interests skills and needs which public libraries need to better address finally we propose potential further research directions and recommendations to help public libraries better meet the needs of older adult patrons including both those who are homebound or institutionalized and those who are more healthy and active though the study described here has limitations with regards to the small sample size and the not identical data collection instruments used at each library we believe that the findings are still useful for public libraries nationwide in particular library staff could use our methods findings and recommendations to evaluate and improve their own programs and services to older adults which could help to attract older adult patrons not only do public libraries potentially stand to gain assistance from older adults as volunteers advisors or staff but these satisfied customers could be strong allies when county governments are deciding what public services should receive more funding mates  literature review previous research has addressed the diverse information needs and interests of the older population jones morrow morris rites  wekstein  moore  young  palmer  wicks  income transportation health and healthcare housing nutrition homemaker services employment consumer needs legal problems companionship and nursing home care are among the most common types of information in which that older adults are generally interested moore  young  other researchers have pointed out that these diverse interests have encouraged older adults to use the mass media including various print sources radio and television for finding information relating to personal needs and leisure activities chatman  williamson  older adults also rely on interpersonal contacts  especially family and friends  as sources of information wicks  williamson  in addition to their diverse information needs and interests older adults themselves are diverse including the full range of cultural ethnic and racial group affiliations that occur in the larger society as a whole there are also different age stages among the older adult population it has been documented that the young old   old old   and oldest old  have different skill levels interests and at varying stages in life kleiman turock  wicks  key among the older adults entering into the young old stage are the baby boomers who are challenging earlier stereotypes about what it means to be an older adult through the ways that their interests and capabilities affect how they adjust to retirement age dempsey  hildreth  kleiman  moen  with the onset of the internet boom of the last decade more attention has been given to older adults use or rather non use of computers for information while greater numbers of american older adults are using computers only  over  use the internet in comparison  of americans    are going online pew internet  american life project  while age related changes have contributed to difficulties for older adults trying to use computers chaparro et al  charness  holley  smith shark  czaja  lack of training and technical support is another major factor affecting older adults use of computers and the

   journal of education for library and information science none of the libraries had any separate funding for older adult services or could give a definitive answer as to when such services might be created one exception was that both library a and b did maintain a budget for a large print collection  provide older adult access to library buildings materials programs and services all three libraries offered homebound services and were american disabilities act compliant yet some problems with accessibility were nonetheless apparent for example one librarian at library a had difficulty using a wheelchair at the entrance because the sidewalk ramp was too steep construction at library c also caused access problems for patrons nevertheless many of the older adult participants at library c described their enjoyment of the layout and look of the branch itself which gave the library a welcoming ambiance other positive aspects of library c include both a disability resource center and a special needs library housed in the same building yet the researchers at all three branches noticed through observation some minor access issues such as the need for bolder call numbers on book spines better lighting and bookcases that are more easily reached by older adults  treat all older adults with respect at every service point each library received high praise from their older adult patrons at library a all older adults surveyed agreed that the reference librarians were friendly and helpful however there were some differences in gender by responses at library a while the older women participants were most satisfied with the library cleanliness older men liked its accessibility meanwhile the staff at library b also received generally high marks from its older adult patrons in fact four of the five older adult participants at library b said that even though their information needs had changed as they grew older library b accommodated them well one older adult at library b even went so far as describing public libraries as one of the greatest public services we have in the us at library c eight out of the ten older adult participants said that their experiences at this library information desk were very helpful and the remaining two said they were somewhat helpful when asked to list three things that they liked best about library c the older adults replied that they appreciated the helpful and friendly staff the beauty and spaciousness of the library and its materials  utilize the experience and expertise of older adults the ala guidelines request that libraries should take actions to ensure that older adults are visible as volunteers staff and on advisory boards at public libraries ala  with regards to volunteerism there are benefits for both the library and older adults for one thing many older adults are retired and able to assist with activities that may be harder for libraries to accomplish with limited staff growing empirical evidence also suggests that volunteering slows the decline in self reported health and functioning levels slows the increase in depression levels and improves mortality rates lum  lightfoot  p  unfortunately even though there were some older adult volunteers at all three libraries that we studied none of these libraries had plans to recruit older adults as staff or to create senior advisory boards also none of these libraries were offering training for staff on how to communicate with older adult patrons

   journal of education for library and information science discussion as reported above each library that we studied received high marks from the older adult participants despite the overall lack of older adult oriented services as recommended by the ala guidelines ala  this was the case especially with regards to the older adult participants attitudes towards library staff the older adult participants generally felt that reference assistance was friendly and helpful in attaining needed information the question that these findings lead us to ask was why these older adults were satisfied despite the issues our study identified eg each of these libraries had some access difficulties they offered few if any services and programs to active older adults did not have older adult specialistsadvisory boards and did not appear to be planning any future services to remedy these issues one possible answer might be that having older adult related programming may not be as important to older adult patrons as having the friendly positive atmosphere that a public library can offer older adults may simply enjoy having interactions with a library staff member who is friendly appears knowledgeable and takes the time to listen to patrons information requests durrance   having the chance to speak casually with a friendly reference librarian may help to meet the social and emotional needs of the older adults especially those who live alone or far from loved ones our older adult participants may be happy with the sense of place that their public library offers to them this is further illustrated in some of the library c participants responses that the renovations at that branch had made their visits even more enjoyable because of a more welcoming ambiance another possible answer might be that these older adults were not dissatisfied because they were not aware that these shortcomings existed at their libraries in other words it could be a case of not missing what you do not have perhaps these older adults expected that few programs and services that took into account diversities of their interest and needs could exist at their library however since the three libraries did not appear to aggressively publicize any programs that they do offer it probably should come as no surprise that the older adults are not aware that their needs could be better addressed in fact one respondent at library b said that she was not aware that the library offered one to one instruction on how to use databases to search the internet to determine the reasons behind this finding more systematic examination of older adult patrons is necessary including asking older adult patrons how aware they are of services that are not offered at their branch this would allow us to examine whether the general level of satisfaction we found in the older adult participants in this study would be different if older adult patrons were to become more conscious of the extent to which the services offered by their branch meet the ala guidelines perhaps the general level of satisfaction might be lower if the older adults believed that they were being short changed with regards to services on the other hand responses to a question that asked older adult patrons to rate the services eg access to older adult specific materials computer instruction helpful and knowledgeable staff that they believe are the most important to their needs might help in understanding what it is that older adults really want from their public libraries another issue that deserves attention is whether the ala guidelines need to be updated while each of the seven guidelines were useful for structuring this project the fact that few of the three libraries met any of them  yet the older adults were still generally satisfied  points to the possible need to revise the guidelines emphasis on guidelines as compared to others may be lacking for instance is
services to older adults preliminary findings from three maryland public libraries  guideline  treat all older adults with respect at every service point more important to a library success with older adults than  utilize the experience and expertise of older adults our findings seem to support such an argument though more systematic examination is necessary before any firm conclusion can be drawn in addition future research needs to take into account the potential impact of the time of the day on the sample selection and consequently on the research findings the surveys for this study were conducted during friday and saturday afternoons how different would the findings have been if the surveys were conducted during the evenings when older adults who work in the daytime visit the library could the older adults who visit the library during the mornings and afternoons have more free time to learn about computers than older adults who have to work during the day these questions deserve further attention recommendations based on our findings we recommend that public libraries interested in better serving their communities aging populations  use computer classes to promote collaboration and lifelong learning  provide more outreach to older adults  approach older adults and  engage minority and foreign born older adults groups use computer classes to promote collaboration and lifelong learning libraries need to collaborate with other organizations and create programs that promote intergenerational learning and interaction through for instance computer training xie  jaeger  in our study we found that recently there have been concerns at library a about teenagers from a nearby high school who come to the library after school and loiter talk loudly and engage in other disruptive behavior these concerns have prompted the library to hire a security guard and have a local sheriff patrol the library on weekday afternoons perhaps an additional solution would be to develop an intergenerational program in which the teenagers teach the older adults to use computers this type of intergenerational programming might help to break down stereotypes that younger people have of older adults while also cementing strong community ties friedman  to encourage teenagers to participate the libraries could work with the schools to award service learning credit another option is to try seniors only computer classes eventually older adult graduates from the classes could teach other older adults in a peer to peer program which may help older adults feel more comfortable and welcome rosserhogben  another positive aspect of computer training is that it could help isolated older adults maintain contact with family and friends for example e mail or participation in senior oriented online discussion groups or chat rooms could help older adults not only find support for the challenges presented by aging but also form new friendships with age peers who have similar interests these types of activities can help empower older adults and give them a better sense of control over personal and social lives dunst trivette  lapointe  mcmellon  schiffman  provide more outreach to older adults public libraries need to better publicize any special programs or services to older adults in the surrounding community not only should libraries post information about older adult services within their libraries or on a website but also in places where older adults are frequently found like churches american legion posts grocery stores senior centers and
   journal of education for library and information science hospitals a concerted attempt at outreach not only helps to publicize events but it is also a good way to draw nonusers into public libraries moore  approach older adults another important step that public libraries can take to ensure older adults needs are being met is to simply ask them what their needs are as jones et al  suggest the first step in any attempt to help elderly people cope with the myriad demands of later life is to find out what they perceive their needs to be pp   periodic user surveys or a suggestion box specifically for older adults to provide feedback and to share their ideas on how the library can better suit their needs are two mechanisms for collecting this information public libraries need to ask older adults what their needs are rather than assuming that these needs are self evident engage minority and foreign born older adult groups public libraries could also benefit from user studies of ethnic minorities in their communities minority groups among all older adults in the united states are projected to increase to  million just over  of the older adult population in    and then to   million  by  administration on aging  public libraries should learn about the cultural traditions among ethnic minority groups in order to create programming that celebrates older adults diverse backgrounds public libraries might also celebrate the cultural diversity of older adults by planning exhibits that celebrate such holidays as chinese new year cinco de mayo and kwanzaa older adult volunteers could be in charge of setting up the materials and telling stories and folktales to children from their native cultures these culturally based initiatives may also bring non users into public libraries conclusion through surveying older adults interviewing staff and observation this study found that not enough attention was being given to older adults needs at three maryland public libraries yet despite the lack of specifically targeted programs services and leadership opportunities for older adults the older adult participants expressed general satisfaction with their libraries and specifically with reference services while more research is needed to understand this assessment by older adults the generally strong approval rating of reference staff and librarians found in our study may suggest that these older adults put more value on a kind and helpful environment than they do on services and programs geared toward older adults it is also possible that the level of satisfaction is related to these older adults lack of awareness that their libraries are not offering the services and programs geared toward older adults that the ala guidelines recommend these aspects should be examined in future research based on our findings we recommend that public libraries should be more proactive in addressing the diverse needs and interests of their older adult patrons including interaction with foreign born and minority groups in the libraries communities better outreach efforts to publicize services may help bring older adults who are currently non users into the library for lifelong learning and empowerment these recommendations can help public libraries to better serve the rapidly aging population in their communities acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the reviewers of an early version of this article that was presented as a juried paper at the association for library and information science education  annual conference
