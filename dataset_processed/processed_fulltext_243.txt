t h e li brary quarterly volume xxxiii october  number  community lending libraries in eighteenth century ireland and wales paul kaufman n o significant cultural movement of the past two centuries has inspired so little searching investigation as the rise and early spread of popular lending libraries in the english speaking world for england itself two studies one of the commercial circulating establishment the other of the non profit subscription type made valuable surveys of a vast unmapped area of important activity for scotland a comprehensive study is now under way for ireland and wales intensive search has produced a frustrating scantiness of evidence but meager though it is the evidence should be and here is presented for ireland first two recent surveys which we may hope presage long delayed research into irish library history one is a useful and reliable article by thomas p oeill and desmond j clarke libraries in ireland an historical outline the second is the thirty page brochure by maura tallon church of ireland diocesan  hilda m hamlyn eighteenth century circulating libraries in england the library th ser i    and frank beckwith the eighteenth century proprietary library in england journal of documentation iii   these descriptive terms circulating and proprietary have long needed a thorough scrutiny as j h shera in foundations of the public library chicago university of chicago press  has pointedly asserted it is time that there be definitions which are generally accepted p n and one might add on both sides of the atlantic if possible obviously both types of organizations are circulating and are supported by subscription but many subscription institutions are not proprietary since the members do not own the property the name social library denoting the non profit organization in the colonial and later american periods however apt and desirable has not been adopted in the present study because it is strange to english ears the expression proposed in the title community lending libraries does per se tacitly include ecclesiastical foundations but it is not thought necessary to prefix another adjective such as secular no apology is offered for return to circulating in these pages since the name was so universally an integral element in the name of establishments and was so universally understood as meaning commercial almost as universally the non profit type was known as a society  this study has been supported in part by a grant from the american philosophical society for indispensable aid i am indebted to the national library of ireland the royal irish academy drs e a crawford and r b mcdowell of trinity college dublin dr thomas wall of the irish folklore commission who sent his private collection of book labels for inspection and to miss maura tallon who has constantly placed her extensive learning at my disposal and provided essential transcripts of material  the library association record lviii    thomas p oeill flat is assistant keeper of printed books national library of ireland desmond j clarke flat is librarian royal dublin society 
 the library quarterly libraries a pioneer compendium filling a large gap miss tallon field of ecclesiastical institutions is beyond the scope of this article but the former survey provides pertinent data and orientation found in it is the promising observation the eighteenth century which witnessed such a tremendous revival in many aspects of irish life consequent upon the anglo irish ruling ascendancy assuming a new interest in the country of their birth also witnessed the foundation growth and development of the learned societies whose libraries were to play an important part in the development of the public library movement in ireland oeill and clarke then present an informative condensed description of the libraries of learned societies but they do not include community lending institutions within the purview of the tremendous revival although the proprietary societies at dublin and belfast are named with a few facts about each and the one at cork is mentioned along with the nineteenth century establishments at limerick and kilkenny the commercial lending establishments are not recognized at all irish circulating libraries admittedly the circulating libraries have concealed themselves with uncanny skill from the eyes of prying posterity to only two indeed is there undeniable testimony a stuart at the circulating library in dane street    and at cork d jacotin catalog of an english french and italian circulating library dated from st patrick street in  an additional reference mentions the egregious mrs lord of dublin most divertingly described by montague summers who alleges that when an irate father made violent protest against the lending of novels too shocking for innocent young girls mrs lord explained that she carefully underlined the passages of doubtful delicacy in lewis monk to warn the reader what to skip  of these three then only one contemporary record of any substance has survived the three page jacotin catalog with a total of fifty one titles and less than a hundred volumes the titles of the first of two pages of the stock transcribed verbatim are helen of glenross a novel genlis novels infernal quixote by charles lucas the knight and mason a novel the village romance by jane elson memoirs of the late mrs robinson mysterious friendship a tale ublin library association of ireland   oeill and clarke op cit p   the only authority is a quoted phrase in h r plomer a dictionary of the printers and booksellers    from   oxford oxford university press  plomer regrettably as too often gives no source but it is probably a dublin directory  a catalogue of the english french and italian circulating library st patrick street cork where books are lent by d jacotin book seller stationer c at one guinea per year thirteen shillings a half year eight shillings and eightpence a quarter three shillings  nine pence half penny a month one british shilling per week cork printed  the verso of the title page specifies the conditions of the lending service in unusually brief terms but with a most unusual trial period as it were for the first month of the subscription which allowed only three days for a loan in town and five days in the country per volume as this is the only catalog of a commercial rental establishment currently known to survive from the eighteenth or very early nineteenth century it has an obviously unique value hence no apology seems necessary for the amount of space accorded it in our survey montague summers the gothic quest london  p  although the waywardly erudite rev mr summers supplies  footnotes to the chapter matthew gregory lewis he overlooks any authority for this engaging reference

 the library quarterly signed the first rules which announced that the great  first object of te society is to form a library which should remain for ever the sole and undivided property of the whole society later the aims were declared to embrace the collection of an extensive library philosophical apparatus and such productions of nature and art as tend to improve the mind and excite a spirit of general enquiry among the fifteen rules were those which established the subscription at one shilling brittish monthly excluded a candidate for membership by six black beans and provided for management by a committee of five a few years later an entrance fee of two guineas was stipulated thus also creating individual property rights in the society ladies were admitted on terms of equality with the male members regarding the development of its collections there was from the outset to be no nonsense the purchase of any common novel or farce or other book of trivial amusement was strictly banned with that problem settled the record of the committee selections as preserved from meeting to meeting in the minutes is of unusual interest the first surviving entry of november   notes that the secretary shall purchase robertson history of scotland kame essays and sketches of the history of man the most approved history of ireland and inform himself previous to the next meeting of the price of buffon natural history with coloured and uncoloured plates evidently the secretary did inform himself for at the next meeting on january   he was instructed to procure the set of buffon whether with the colored or uncolored plates is not specified robertson disquisitions concerning india encyclopedia britannica kello sermons analytical reviews anacharsis travels travels through greece and mitford history of greece one of the members robert cary came forward with the gift of curry history of ireland in the following seven meetings to october  these significant typically eighteenth century selections were ordered gillies history of greece transactions of the royal society of london transactions of the royal irish academy the transactions of the bath and manchester societies of the edinburgh philosophical society of the royal society of edinburgh philosophical transactions of the society at philadelphia dodsley annual register beginning with  lavater aphorisms dr burney history of music johnson lives of the poets pope works the best edition hume and smollett history of england collection of etruscan greek and roman antiquities monasticon hibernicum priestley history of electricity asiatic researches boswell life of johnson cook voyages and life evelyn sylva monro treatise on fishes observations on the volcanoes of the two sicilies and an atlas in addition to these purchases among many others a total of fortythree titles some like the universal history in twenty volumes being multivolume works were presented by members also by way of commutation of entrance fee a certain number of works were occasionally offered  the fourteen volumes offered by mr beard in lieu of admission money would seem to be generous indeed especially since mr samuel robinson offered two octavo volumes a portion of a set of curtis botanical magazine p  mr beard list as given in the minutes includes a wide range of standard works
lending libraries in ireland and wales  during this early formative period after much exploration the society accepted in  a most welcome offer of a room over the central hall of the linen hall where it remains in larger quarters to this day it was still a small society with only eighty nine members in  but many of these were among belfast most eminent citizens as fully set forth in this invaluable history summary of irish developments thus the sum total of both types of community libraries for the whole century is disconcertingly small for the commercial type as we have seen the known data are well nigh negligible for the subscription societies it is not improbable that the entire story is recorded in the three institutions just described for it seems unlikely that in a country of the size and social patterns of ireland others would have developed and disappeared without trace but not to be forgotten are subscription libraries at limerick and kilkenny in the nineteenth century as well as one in londonderry founded in  why more of them did not develop earlier is one of the unsolved problems which serve to emphasize the too often neglected fact that library history perforce is a fascinating image of the complete social history of a particular community or nation the possible implication of the late development of the societies needs further exploration in england many of the non profit libraries were established in the last two decades of the century in london the first proprietary institution was founded in  here as in numerous provincial centers adequate circulating libraries supplied the needs of most readers hence in the light of so relatively late appearance of the irish subscription societies the possibility exists that commercial rental libraries in major or even smaller irish cities however lost to sight suppliedalong with an occasional purchase the needs of irish readers the abundant evidence of the multiplication of these after  supports the assumption i these are named with identification on p  and the complete list of members in  is given on pp   the range of pertinent information provided is most useful and the text is supplemented with a number of maps of belfast at various periods and with illustrations mr j w vitty librarian presented a copy to the university of washington library one significant sidelight worth noting is the resolutions passed by the society in  and  in favor of catholic emancipation and expressing sympathy with the struggles for freedom and also in favor of a free school the full texts of the resolutions pp   are notable in their dignified earnestness when this volume was published in  the list of members given complete with names was proprietors  members  guinea subscribers  and half guinea subscribers  in the report for  the number of members was  and that of subscribers  by then the original ban on any common novel had been relaxed in  the issues of fiction were  history and biography the next largest after children books  theology  at the leeds library established in  one of the few surviving libraries of this kind in england the proprietors are limited to  but members of families of proprietors may use the library on payment of an extra fee  the source of the date for londonderry is colby ordnance survey of the county of londonderry i   as given in beckwith op cit p   in the forthcoming extensive study of the libraries in england it is planned to offer explanations of the social forces determining the extent and kind of library facilities scanty vestiges of evidence however greatly complicate any final assessments  see my article the eighteenth century forerunner of the london library papers of the bibliographical society of america     dr thomas wall remarks in a personal communication that there were many commercial circulating libraries attached to drug shops and bookstores in the nineteenth century and lists
 the library quarterly that a number of booksellers in various parts of the country before  simply maintained an informal rental activity with a single shelf or two without advertising or leaving other record for various and complex reasons the popular library movement in ireland seems to have found momentum later than in england welsh circulating libraries the corresponding evidence of developments in wales is on the whole just as disappointingly limited it is lacking in the catalogs found in ireland and is actually inferior to irish sources for the subscription institutions but there are references to more circulating libraries and the scholar commands a far wider background of related library facilities and cultural activities for circulating libraries data come mainly from two sources book labels with eighteenth century typography of course and the indispensable guide to all the watering and sea bathing places in england and wales    by the editor of the picture of london london  the labels contribute mostly bare names with a few details now and then thomas payne bookseller in wrexham john theophilus potters well chosen and extensive circulating library haverfordwest yearly subscribers   j h clark printer and stationer usk to be kept four days for which three pence will be charged and e owen circulating library wind street swansea new and old books pamphlets magazines etc neatly bound gilt and letter stationery in all its branches for ready money only printed by e owen  the guide mentions two more  in wind street swansea mrs and miss oakey circulating libraryterms per an   quarter    month   and  evan circuof a few of them two in drogheda and one in newry county down  obviously politico religious tensions are prominent if not paramount in the complex of social forces here one possible glimpse of causes may be noted in the clandestine teachings and small religious libraries of the widespread confraternity activity the rt rev martin brenan ma formerly of st patrick college maynooth now of edenderry county offaly has been kind enough to send me his brochure the confraternity of christian doctrine in ireland ad   dublin etc   pp which is highly informative quoting from the first report of commissioners on education in ireland may   p  msgr brenan notes that a lending library of religious books is usually attached to each of these confraternities a   in the city of limerick    on one sunday upwards of  children were instructed under these auspices p  in this concentration on religious teaching and reading may perhaps be found a partial cause of the late development of secular community libraries  i would gratefully acknowledge the aid of the librarian of the national library of wales e d jones ba fsa of the keeper of printed books david jenkins ma and of the keeper of mss and record bg owens also of the city librarian of cardiff j e thomas fla of the reference librarian eh jones and of the archivist t j hopkins at the central library of cardiff to professor cecil j l price university college of swansea and miss eiluned rees the british museum i am particularly indebted for numerous references and expert efforts to help in every way dr price volume the english theatre in wales in tlhe eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries cardiff university of wales press  is an indispensable background and his article polite life in eighteenth century wales yr einion the welsh anvil v    provides not only succinct data in general but also a number of valuable notes on libraries miss rees from her own current study of welsh libraries has supplied many valuable references  mr w c rogers borough estate agent swansea gives the additional detail that the oakeys announced in  terms for the reading room where newspapers and periodicals may be read l  per ann    per i yr   per quarter   per month this is significant in disclosing quarters large enough for customers accommodation
