effects of reading upon attitudes toward the negro race evalene p jackson ibrarians often talk about the social significance of the library but assumptions that reading the library product is an activity bringing about socially desirable results have not yet been substantiated by any great amount of experimental evidence one socially significant result of reading might be changed attitudes brought about by reading materials dealing with the objects or values toward which those attitudes were directed the purposes of the study described in this paper were i to investigate the effects of reading fiction upon the attitudes toward the negro race of a group of southern white children assuming a decrease in prejudice against that race to be desirable and  to show the applicability to a library problem of a technique borrowed from social psychology the measurement of attitudes the concept of attitudes has been widely used by social psychologists allport upon an examination of sixteen definitions of attitudes found a common thread running through all of them in one way or another each definition regards the essential feature of attitude as a preparation or readiness for response  an attitude is a mental and neural state of readiness organized through experience exerting a directive or dynamic influence upon the individual response to all objects and situations with which it is related it has been called probably the most distinctive and indispensable concept in contemporary american social psychology attitudes are measurable by scales designed to indicate the degree of their prejudice in favor of or against an object such as a race or a country the use of such a device makes it possible for an investigator to measure attitudes toward certain objects before and after the reading of material dealing with those objects and under properly controlled conditions to detect the influence of this reading upon them according to general belief our attitudes tend to be favorable toward the familiar through experience we become familiar with and less hostile toward the strange much of the hostility toward the negro is a result of the failure of the southern white to perceive that the negro is essentially a creature like himself the conditions of southern culture give him few opportunities of seeing the negro in roles other than those conforming to his stereotype of the negro as a servant as dollard says it is often something of a discovery when white people learn that there are negro people i a paper based on a study reported in miss jackson master essay submitted to the school of library service columbia university in   gordon w ailport attitudes in carl murchison ed a handbook of social psychology worcester mass clark university press i p   ibid p io  ibid p  s truman l kelley and a c krey tests and measurements in the social sciences report of the commission on the social studies part iv new york charles scribner sons  p  
 the library quarterly of refined feeling and noteworthy talent because they stand in such sharp contrast to the white caste stereotype of the negro reading might serve to change this stereotype through its provision of a vicarious experience of negro life an experience difficult to come by in actual living this reading should of course emphasize the humanity of the negro rather than the ways in which the white man supposes that he differs from himself educators have believed that reading helps to fix such attitudes rosenblatt feels that books may help fix attitudes toward different races consider the influence for instance of the fact that the child usually encounters the negro presented as an object for laughter or at best as a kind of prize domestic animal as in so many novels of the south purporting to show the kindness of masters to servants the repeated impact of such images bodied forth in poems novels plays and biographies surely adds something to the complex pressures acting on the individual and leading him to crystallize his sense of the world about him and his sense of the appropriate attitudes to assume toward it i a richards has called the attitudes evoked the important part of any experience art he regards as a potent experience in bringing about growth and change indeed he holds that among all the agents by which the widening of the sphere of human sensibility may be brought about the arts are the most powerful since it is through them that men may most cooperate and in these experiences that the mind most easily and with least interference organizes itself it was assumed for the purpose of this study that a story might serve as such an agent it was believed that the attitudes of a group of southern white children toward the negro race might be modified by reading fiction presenting that race in a sympathetic light the problem of attitude modification has been approached by others no attempt is made to review the literature of the subject here since adequate summaries are available elsewhere the interested reader is referred to allport to droba and to dunham murphy murphy and newcomb have also reviewed experimental studies of the effects of extra school experiences some of which involved reading upon attitudes to summarize the conclusions reached experimental studies of the possibility of affecting attitudes have in general yielded positive results although the changes have usually been of a small order of magnitude such investigations have usually followed a pattern i the measurement of the attitudes in question  the application of some stimulus designed to affect these attitudes and  a second measurement of the attitudes to ascertain the change produced in them by the stimulus several studies report the use of reading as such a stimulus according to waples et al john dollard caste and class in a southern town new haven yale university press  p  louise m rosenblatt literature as exploration new york d appleton century co i p   principles of literary criticism new york harcourt brace  co  p i  ibid pp i  op ci pp   daniel d droba topical summaries of current literature social attitudes american journal of sociology xxxix i   i h warren dunham topical summaries of current literature social attitudes american journal of sociology xlvi     gardner murphy lois barclay murphy and theodore m newcomb experimental social psychology rev ed new york harper  bros i pp    otto klineberg social psychology new york henry holt  co  p 
effects of reading upon attitudes  such studies   have repeatedly shown that reading can change attitudess so far as the investigator knows this is the first study of changes in attitudes toward the negro race as a result of reading fiction lasker cites the cases of children who claimed that they had acquired racial attitudes through reading stories anti jewish attitudes were in one instance aroused by reading a fairy tale and confirmed years later by the merchant of venice another child learned to love the germans through their literature to such an extent that she was to some degree proof against propaganda during the first world war the plan of this study this study follows the same general pattern described above in its use of i an initial measurement of attitudes  an experimental situation and  a subsequent measurement of attitudes two equated groups of junior high school children were used as subjects an experimental group reading fiction presenting the negro race in a sympathetic light and a control group doing no reading attitudes were measured for a third time after a fortnight to ascertain if the change produced by the reading was lasting in order to equate factors which might if not controlled influence attitude shifts groups were matched to insure similarity the factors in respect to which they were matched were sex intelligence chronological age and socioeconomic status the bearing of these factors upon attitudes is uncertain there is no consensus in regard to the relation between sex differences and prejudice for or against the negro murphy murphy and newcomb point out considerable evidence is at hand regarding sex differences in racial attitudes but no generalizations whatever are warranted both men and women according to various investigations have been found to be reliably more favorable toward the negro while no differences at all are reported in still others nothing short of a comparison of males and females from the same homes can give us authentic information on this point and we know of no such evidencex the same number of male and female children were however used in each group children from both groups were likewise paired according to intelligence for other things equal  individuals of low intelligence may be presumed to borrow ready made attitude stereotypes most freelyi it would be thus assumed that less intelligent subjects were more conventionally southern ie more unfavorably prejudiced in their attitudes toward negroes than subjects of greater intelligence it is not known how soon anti negro prejudice develops in children but racial attitudes are not innate this brings up the question of when these prejudices appear for once it is granted that prejudice against races is not a native trait there must of course be age differences in racial attitudes since attitudes develop during some period of time the only question is how early and how rapidly do they develop there is some evidence that anti negro prejudice develops early even in children outside the southern environment the suggestion has been made that many differences are simply the result of living under certain cultural conditions every i douglas waples bernard berelson and franklyn r bradshaw what reading does to people chicago university of chicago press ii p io  bruno lasker race attitudes in children new york henry holt  co i pp i  op cit p is ibid p   ibid p   ibid p   _ i pp  
 the library quarterly effort was made to secure children who had been immersed in this particular culture for the same length of time all chosen were natives of atlanta georgia there is no certainty that the socioeconomic status of an individual influences his attitudes and in view of the complicated network of influences responsible for attitude formation it seems positively naive to expect to find simple correlations between socio economic status and a particular attitude because of the lack of evidence on this point and the possibility of increased animosity due to greater economic rivalry on the part of children from poorer homes children were also matched in this respect the sims score card for socioeconomic status was used for obtaining the necessary data on the children background data on sex intelligence and chronological age were secured from school records the children were equated pair by pair for the first two factors the mean chronological age and the mean socioeconomic status for the two groups were matched the differences between the means exceeding the probable error of those means in neither case it was originally planned to secure fiction to use in this experiment from among children books in current use in libraries certain arbitrary standards largely based upon common sense were adopted for purposes of selection the material had to be a story about a negro it had to provide a sympathetic and interesting reading experience for children twelve to fourteen years of age preferably it should stress the similarity of the needs and personality of the negro child to those of the white child while showing the dissimilarity of the circumstances and opportunities of his life of necessity the story or passage could not be beyond the reading ability of the average eighthgrade child to achieve these objectives the following criteria were set up i presentation of the negro as a normal human being essentially similar to the white but denied his opportunities for achievement and self expression  simple vivid narrative quality  situations of interest to junior high school students the interest of such a group would include home school adventure and a dawning interest in adult books  a vocabulary level suitable to the seventh grade the level was kept a grade lower than that of the children in order to facilitate comprehension  avoidance of dialect lasker feels that one of the worse features of popular literature for children from the point of view of racial attitudes is the pigeon english or ridiculous diction that is put into the mouth of foreigners  while negro dialect is not precisely pidgin english to the southern white child it is a factor which leads to a feeling of superiority when seen in print  a reading time of no more than twenty five minutes since it was necessary to adapt the experiment to the exigencies of the school schedule a search for a story meeting these requirements was unsuccessful and a short story was therefore constructed according to these criteria while any attempt to conform to such principles of propaibid p ioi  sims score card for socio economic status form c bloomington ill public school pub co   lewis m terman and margaret lima children reading d ed new york d appleton  co i pp    op cst p 
effects of reading upon attitudes  ganda as those presented by doob was avoided it cannot be denied that the purpose was to control the attitudes of  indivlduals  therefore strictly speaking the passage used falls within the category of propaganda no claim to literary excellence is made the story was used as a makeshift in lieu of better material the children however evinced their interest by numerous questions as to the subsequent fate of the boy about whom the story was written the story was first written then checked with the thorndike word list in order to eliminate words beyond the seventh grade level ie those beyond the first  the hinckley scale for measuring attitudes toward the negro was used in ascertaining the attitudes of the groups this scale consists of two forms a and b and is one of a series the measurement of social attitudes constructed according to principles devised by l l thurstone and published by the university of chicago press the psychophysical method which thurstone used is based upon the conception of degrees of favorable or unfavorable prejudice as shown by the person agreement or disagreement with certain statements for instance agreement with the statement inherently the negro and the white man are equal is evidence of considerable favorableness toward the negro conversely agreement with the statement i place the negro on the same social basis as i would a mule is evidence of unfavorable prejudice the process of constructing the scale was this the attitude to be measured was stated from one hundred to one hundred and fifty statements about this attitude were collected from magazines newspapers people etc the statements which express unfavorable prejudice neutrality and favorableness were then rated by a number of judges as to the degree of these qualities which they indicated the scale value assigned to each item was the median of all the scale values assigned by the judges statements receiving widely differing judgments were discarded as unsuitable suitable statements were used in the final scale care being taken that they were evenly spaced with respect to favorableness the person whose attitudes are being tested checks all statements with which he agrees and his score is the median scale value for all those indorsed scores may be interpreted according to the following table ooi strongly prejudiced against the negro  prejudiced against the negro  neutral position  liberal toward the negro  io very liberal toward the negro the statements on both forms of the scale were checked for vocabulary difficulty and words beyond the seventhgrade level were replaced by synonyms falling within it the procedure for administering the scales was as follows i form a was administered to both groups  the ex leonard w doob propaganda its psychology and technique new york henry holt  co i  ibid p   edward l thorndike a teacher word book of the twenty thousand words found most frequently and widely in general reading for children and young people new york teachers college columbia university i  edward l thomdike the vocabularies of juvenile books library quarterly v  i  l l thurstone and e j chave the measwuement of attitude chicago university of chicago press  instructionsfor using the scale attitude toward the negro chicago university of chicago press

effects of reading upon attitudes  conclusions a small but significant shift from a less to a more favorable attitude toward the negro race as measured by the hinckley scale was indicated by the mean scores of the experimental group in the first school after reading fiction which presented that race in a sympathetic light this shift was not lasting a repetition of the experiment in a second school revealed a small but insignificant shift in the same direction on the part of the experimentals in this particular situation reading does seem to have had a measurable social effect if not a lasting one the findings are in accord with what is known of the influence of reading upon attitudes it must be remembered that in both schools experimental and control groups were equated within the particular school there was no attempt to equate the schools with each other the children at the first school were slightly more intelligent than those at the second whereas the children from the second school were slightly older than those from the first in respect to socioeconomic status children from the first school were of a very high status while those from the second were of a high status it is felt that too little is known of the correlation of intelligence chronological age and socioeconomic status with attitudes or attitude change to offer this as an explanation of the differences in the influence of reading on the attitudes of the children in the two schools if other factors not present in the circumstances of the first experiment entered into the second the investigator is unaware of them differences might possibly have resulted from such conditions as failure on the part of the investigator to secure as friendly a relationship with subjects or less interest on the part of the children in the reading matter a further explanation of these factors is outside the scope of this study which included no examination of predispositions of subjects which might make them more or less responsive to particular reading materials under similar circumstances the attitudes of the first experimental group shifted significantly the attitudes of the second group did not the change effected by reading was not lasting the score of the experimental group on the third test indicated that the gain made after reading fiction was lost in two weeks it should be remembered that the time involved was brief the reading and the two tests all falling within an hour findings cannot be used to forecast action on the part of the subjects for as kelley and krey point out a test of attitude administered after emotion which caused violent change  would have little value in predicting future conduct modification of such attitudes can be accomplished only by repeated or reinforced treatment extending at least through school years and often beyond that time it is hoped that further studies will be made of the influence of reading upon attitudes evidence as to the cumulative effect of the reading experience is particularly needed as this study involved only one such experience the result of which was not lasting comparisons of the relative efficacy of various types of reading materials in producing attitude change might also be made investigations of the possibility of using other scales from the fields of psychology and social psychology in studying library problems might be carried further since some of these scales should be applicable for example evidence as  kelley and krey op cit p 
 the library quarterly to the influence of reading upon such personality traits as life values might be gathered by employing similar techniques and the allport vernon scale this scale consists of a number of questions designed to reveal the relative dominance in the personality of several values aesthetic economic social religious political and theoretical examination of the hildreth bibliography of mental tests and rating scales and the buros bibliographies should suggest some of the ways of going about collecting data to answer questions now asked as to the ways in which reading influences readers in view of the fact that a change in attitude was produced by reading in a specific situation librarians might be urged to give more representation to fiction in which the negro is presented in a natural and sympathetic light publishers should be encouraged to make available more stories of this type suitable for children an effort should be made to publicize such material to children and to adults this study makes no pretense of being more than an approach to the problem of the social significance of reading and it has touched upon but one limited aspect of that problem the results do seem to indicate the possibility upon the basis of further experiments with such instruments and the development and perfection of others of measuring the influence of reading upon communities in terms of such effects as changed attitudes the attitudes of a school toward a certain race or social problem might be measured at the beginning of a term if during that term a library program designed to bring about more favorable attitudes toward that race or problem was planned and carried out the influence of the library upon these attitudes might be measured by a repetition of the scale another school in which no such program was tried could if desined be used as a control in the case of the public library the effects of a program designed to bring about better race relationships might be measured by testing samples of the population before during and at the end of that program this of course implies the co operation of the community which depends largely upon its attitudes toward the library such tests might be made at community meetings if the audience were representative of the library public the data found in this study are less useful as evidence of the influence of reading upon attitudes than as the demonstration of a method of evaluating library service in terms of social significance further studies utilizing similar methods and producing more evidence should suggest further applications  gordon w allport and philip e vernon a study of values boston houghton mifflin co   gertrude h hildreth a bibliography of mental tests and rating scales d ed new york psychological corp i  oscar k buros educational psychological and personality tests of i i and  rutgers university bulletins vol xiii no i studies in education no  new brunswick school of education rutgers university  oscar k buros educational psychological and personality tests of  rutgers university bulletins vol xiv no a studies in education no i i new brunswick school of education rutgers university  oscar k buros mental measurements yearbook new brunswick rutgers university press i
