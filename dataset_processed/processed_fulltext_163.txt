from our readers    the membership of reforma the national association to promote library services to the spanish speaking is quite alarmed and dismayed about the fact and fiction in the article by donald o case and john v richardson entitled predictors of student performance with emphasis on gender and ethnic determinants   in the journal of education for library and information science winter  we are deeply disappointed that ucla graduate school of library and information science has not shown more leadership in this continuing controversy while it is a fact that dean beverly p lynch addressed the reforma membership at the ala annual conference this past june it is not sufficient to simply reassure and restate in deeply emphatic terms the commitment of ucla gslis to the recruitment and retention of ethnic minorities it is also a fact that the majority of gslis faculty do not support the article as evidenced by a letter dated    sent to the journal of education for library and information science reforma has like the faculty strong criticism about the article the article is seriously flawed at best and at worst it resorts to blaming the victims for their alleged failure in library school a characteristically racist ploy we resent the article allegation that minority students are not motivated enough or committed to the library profession we cannot believe that minorities drop out of library school because affirmative action has created a cornucopia of lucrative job opportunities library schools need to conduct a serious introspective examination focusing on among other items current demonstrated commitment in support and in the spirit of affirmative action and cultural diversity they are not providing a supportive environment for their minority students the information and results offered in the article are an indictment of the graduate school of library and information science at ucla it reflects the failure to successfully retain the minority students enrolled which is all the more frustrating to reforma given recent efforts to increase minority enrollment when students drop out of school it is the school that should receive the failing grade for creating a nonsupportive environment for the minority student many of us remember the astounding success of the gli sa program at the university of arizona that program recognized the value of a truly supportive and nurturing environment and produced many outstanding latino librarians we are all aware that students needing assistance or counseling demand time and care the reforma ucla mentor program provides a large amount of counseling and assistance to proteges but the main responsibility must rest with the faculty when reforma members read that dropouts waste an inordinate amount of faculty and staff energy considering the time spent reviewing each application for admission and counseling students who are doing poorly or who are dissatisfied with the program we can only conclude the authors find minority students a timeconsuming bother let no one confuse or associate reforma  criticism with an atsummerfall  
journal of education for library and information science tack on academic and intellectual freedom the article authors have every right to publish their opinions and research reforma encourages research in the area of minorities and library schools but not reckless and insensitive reports that dash a minority student hopes and dreams let us all take this as an opportunity to move forward and assist those willing to live a commitment to cultural diversity in the library profession reforma is offering to any library school but specifically to ucla gslis faculty a three hour presentation on latino issues in library science and the profession this is reforma s answer and we feel it is a positive step toward ameliorating what appears to be a prejudicial mind set among some faculty of what it means to be a man or woman of color  a minority in ucla graduate school of library and information science ronald rodriguez president national reforma library education has from the earliest days of the american library association been a significant part of the association concern although accreditation is most frequently associated with ala role in library education the association has also encouraged the development of library schools it is now in the position of needing to encourage their survival with the closing of the school of library service at columbia university the number of private institutions with library education programs is further reduced perhaps worse for the field of librarianship the number of programs that can prepare doctoral candidates for leadership roles in research administration teaching and innovative practice becomes very small as a past president of the american library association i am dedicated to a strong profession with its participants well prepared in library education programs housed in highly regarded institutions of higher education i believe that these programs have to be geographically accessible i know they need excellent faculty and that the pool of candidates for the many faculty positions that can be anticipated in the near future is also quite limited i am aware that the glib response to these problems in some regions is to open the ranks of librarians to those who are not academically well prepared and i believe that is the wrong response instead i recommend that the association encourage a program of action including but not limited to the following   encourage increased communication between practicing librarians and the library education programs in their region as well as the library education programs from which they graduated  sponsor research especially relating to the links between university libraries and library education programs identifying mutual concerns shared agendas for research and development and the needs for preparation of librarians for positions in those university libraries as well as in the larger community  call attention through public relations and publications to the dynamic library education programs that exist and identify the characteristics that have contributed not merely to their survival but to their success  encourage the committee on accreditation and its site visit teams to take a more assertive stance in regard to library education programs eg directly commending them for aspects of their program that contribute to excellence communicating with administrators about the strengths of the programs as well as about the needs and weaknesses and keeping in their own minds a vision of the continuing needs for library education programs and a recognition that it is almost always better to bolster and contribute  volume  numbers 
from our readers    to a developing or diminished program than it is to attempt to develop a new program from the ground up  develop an informal network of support for administrators of library education programs that they may tap when they sense that their programs are targeted for review provide a forum for discussion of such issues as whether library education programs ought to consider revising their scope mission administrative structures or other characteristics eg to teach some undergraduate courses to form cooperative interinstitutional doctoral programs or to be the channel of more continuingeducation opportunities designed for librarians peeerv sullivan director northern illinois university libraries summerfall
