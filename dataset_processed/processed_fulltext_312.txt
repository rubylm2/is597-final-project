aslib at war traditionally acquired their foreign subscriptions either through exchange agreements with libraries and association publishers abroad or through the book trade these networks disintegrated gradually as hitler armies occupied more and more of continental europe and his submarines wrestled for control of the atlantic soon after hostilities began the british government restricted the purchase of enemy goods to holders of special import licenses a system which caused some hardship the cambridge philosophical society library for example was unable to obtain such a license for months and had to make its large overseas orders through the university library booksellers in neutral countries such as the netherlands neutral until may  and switzerland were still able to order from germany a dutch firm could report in the winter of  that  p till now we have had no trouble in dispatching german journals to abroad journal exchanges involving no transfer of money with the enemy continued as well as the somewhat circuitous mails would permit materials from the soviet union till june  an ally of germany slowed to a trickle however information channels were critically damaged by the german invasion of denmark norway the netherlands belgium and france in the spring of  british orders for german periodicals were then shifted when possible to antiquarians in sweden portugal and switzerland although swiss book dealers ceased being able to export effectively after the german occupation of vichy france in late  the import of american publications also was increasingly imperiled as the battle of the atlantic grew in ferocity after   for example a whole shipment of november  issues of american scholarly and scientific periodicals bundled together for distribution to british libraries was lost when the ship carrying it was sunk by a torpedo by april  aslib reported that no copies of french german or italian periodicals had reached the united kingdom after the issues of may  and that technical literature from russia was greatly delayed the loss of foreign scientific and technical information sources coincided with an acceleration in demand for technical materials from the armed forces and industry while the keeper of the books at the science museum library anticipated reduced usage and consequently let  of his staff go borrowing from that institution actually increased dramatically the total number of borrowing institutions rose from a prewar level of  to over  by  the library reported that the areas most heavily impacted on by defense activities were physics chemistry and engineering  all subjects in which german journals were traditionally strong aslib mobilizes for the crisis in the six months preceding the united states entry into the war aslib sharpened its focus on the problem of the shortage of german periodicals the organization had already in june  started to issue a series of wartime guides to sources of specialspring
