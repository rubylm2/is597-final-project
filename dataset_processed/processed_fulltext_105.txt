the library quarterly volume iv january  number i the democratic function of public libraries america has been one of the significant democratic laboratories of the nineteenth century democracy had set going various social and educational activities which we may regard as experiments carried on for the purpose of giving free and equal opportunity to all people of lifting the race from ignorance and of preparing it for social responsibilityactivities which were expected to give the democratic ideal its reality and consummation of all such essays none has been more truly democratic and liberal in motive or dare we say in some respects more naive than the creation of the free public library in seeking a cause for this spirit of liberalism we need at this time go no farther back than to the american and french revolutions here we can trace the political and philosophical thought which was stressing in violent terms the need for intellectual and social freedom for all the people in the decades which followed the spirit of the times came to rest upon the conviction that the world was an automotive thing running itself to good purpose if human intelligence at its highest guided its course but to bad purpose if the masses of people remained in ignorance the whole nineteenth century can be called a period of buoy

democratic function of public libraries  were making a brave attempt to meet the supposed needs of masses who it was thought would throng their doors for further knowledge we must say supposed needs since it is evident from the beginning that librarians had no trustworthy way of judging the specific needs and interests of the individuals who composed their heterogeneous groups of patrons there is however this difference to be drawn between our schools and our libraries in their methods of transmitting the culture of the world public education has been linked securely from the beginning with the church the town and the state the connection of libraries with the state has been far more tenuous due in part perhaps to philanthropic donors who have shared in their support but due mainly as professor s e leland has pointed out to the fact that the special taxes levied by independent library boards for library purposes have not been subject to the scrutiny of municipal budget makersi in education on account of the connections noted a directive and even coercive influence upon the youth of the country has been possible this has been almost entirely lacking in relation to the clientele of the library which is composed of adults as well as children a lack which tends to be perpetuated one is inclined to think by a kind of sentimental veneration for books en masse which precludes in some measure the notion of the need for any kind of surveillance where in education youth is guided and regimented in its activity by state supported teachers who are influenced by the authority of tradition in the form of established curricula the only guide for service to the clientle of the library has been the variety of reading interests of library patrons as interpreted by the librarian true occasional social pressures restricting the librarian choice have been brought to bear in the way of censorship of certain books the actual effect of this however has been small in comparison with the total amount of freedom enjoyed on the whole the public library has presented the curious anomaly of an institution which has been established for the i obscrvations on financing public libraries library quarterly ii

  the library tuarterly telligent works a growing concept of the important task ahead of them namely that of offering to the individuals and groups which compose their library clientele a truly educative and selective kind of service a few large libraries have been able in spite of although one can also say on account of difficult economic conditions to establish adult education departments through which the library co operates with all sorts of adult educational agencies the endeavor is being made in various ways to make effective contacts with individuals and with groups to discover or to arouse their interest in reading and to offer them discriminating aid the oldest service of this kind is the reference or information department through which the library supplies information and material needed by students and teachers by civic and business clubs and organizations and by general readers a more recent service is that of the readers adviser whose function it is to aid in the selection of readable and reliable books suited to individual readers and to plan courses of reading for those who wish to read to some serious purpose or to some definite end either cultural or practical young people reading is being studied in order to prepare and guide the adolescent to meet the problems and interests of adulthood special aid in definite fields of subject matter is being given through well developed departmental libraries and through teachers rooms to teachers and students who require professional literature on pedagogy and on educational and related problems library service is extended sometimes to hospitals through reading grave or gay adapted to the needs of individual patients to the foreign born in an effort to help them to become adjusted to the new world efforts such as these indicate a tendency to substitute in some measure a selective service for the indiscriminate collective kind which frequently satisfied neither the general reader nor the specialist nor the librarian himself but is it to be expected that public libraries can ever offer the kind of selective service that will satisfy the needs of specialists and scholars of various kinds  can their book collections or the service which they render cover the whole field of knowledge as
democratic function of public libraries  was formerly assumed to be their function before specialization had resulted in extreme subdivision of subject matter we have found that specialized libraries antedating and co existing with public libraries continue to be devoted to definite fields of subject matter with the function of meeting the needs of special groups of patrons who are equipped to carry on investigations in these fields very special libraries covering all sorts of specific subjects have been called into existence by the requirements of smaller and more homogeneous groups and have assumed functions which public libraries on the whole have never attempted to fill within their narrower fields the chief effort is to carry over information and ideas found in printed material to those who need and can use such matter the function of the special library and its relation with the public library was discussed at length during the two decades preceding the establishment of the special libraries association in i and since that time as well some public librarians have not been able to accept easily the idea of relinquishing the assumed function of meeting all of the reading needs of all of the people this seemed at least ideally to belong to their institutions they assumed that their task was to recognize new needs as they arose and to make every possible effort to meet them where funds permitted specialized collections were established within the larger libraries but the majority of such libraries have found it impractical to carry this out on any large and intensive scale not only are technical books and other forms of specialized printed material very expensive but the more specialized they are the fewer are the patrons who will use them thus even though it was considered by some that the public library failed to do its duty in not undertaking to build up such collections the impracticability of doing so was early realized and the task was left to other bodies exceptions there have been of course where certain large and important libraries have been able to build up local collections of great value active business branches and other special collections covering definite fields intensively yet sooner or later as fields of knowledge become more and more specialized and subdivided the question will always arise with respect to
 the library quarterly every field how far can or should the public library supported by general taxation undertake to cover ground which is of interest to specialists only the problem becomes one then of distinguishing between the kinds of service which can and ought to be expected from the two types of libraries as pointed out a library which exists to meet the interests of the general reader of varying degrees of ability and equipment has its task much less clearly marked out than one which acts as an agent in helping to promulgate definite knowledge through expert service to specialists where the interests of patrons seem to the librarian vague and all inclusive books are apt to be chosen subjectively that is according to the librarian standard of judgment alone this may frequently lead to a service which does not coincide with the true needs of the readers the special librarian on the other hand deals with a more circumscribed field of knowledge and with a clientele whose interests and equipment tend to be uniform a knowledge of their definite needs furnishes an objective basis for the selection and use of books is it possible to define in part and perhaps limit the function of the public library in an effort to describe its service in more tangible and concrete terms the apparent separation of purpose between public and specialized libraries need not be as complete perhaps as seems the case at first thought the primary aims of both relate to knowledge in the case of one to the spread of the fruits of knowledge among the people of the other to the extension through aid given to research and study of the boundaries of knowledge specialists have studied and are studying aspects and segments of larger problems which have full social significance however only when the results are brought together again into a corrected relationship with the larger fields of thought for the further improvement of situations these results must then be put to trial and into action by those who can manipulate them intelligently if the true democratic ideal is to be realized even in moderate measure of extending a knowledge of these results to the intelligent layman in order to prepare him for par
democratic function of public libraries is ticipation in their social utlization it is obvlous that it must be made possible for him to come into contact with them and grasp their meaning thus one of the functions of the modern public library is clear namely the carrying over to general readers of the significance of worth while results of investigations which have been carried on through the help of specialized libraries by scholars and specialists but specialists usually write for specialists in technical language which is not easily understood by general readers forward looking librarians who are strengthening their services for individuals realize the difficulty of the problem presented in their effort to carry over to general readers the socially valuable results of research they are confronted with the need for forms of writing adapted to the diverse requirements and equipment of varying types of readers which will convey in a readable and accurate way the meanings desired librarians may well encourage writers to couch their findings in understandable and illuminating form and at the same time improve their own equipment and facilities for distributing this product freely to eager readers knowledge adjusted to and assimilated by intelligent readers will become part of the social thought content and will thus gradually enrich the life of the people the public library with the aid of authors publishers and the readers themselves can in this way become a unifying influence in a world of diversity and specialization and through its service share in humanizing the world best thought for we can have faith to believe that the intelligent reading of worth while books on important matters that are of mutual interest both to the reader and to the author will result gradually in a clearer understanding of the changing concepts of society and all of its problems this in turn will lead to a more effective and enlightened control over social conditions increase the probability of happier and more successful living and in this way justify the vision of democracy grace  kelley the queens borough public library jamaica new york
