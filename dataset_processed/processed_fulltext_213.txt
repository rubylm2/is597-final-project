the educational change game mary lee bundy this approach is particularly recommended for faculty who are unsatisfied with their present programs have reached stalemates in their efforts to make change and who are now willing to try almost anything this game is designed to overcome the typical problems which confront educational change  curriculum decisions are made divorced from the goal of preparing a professional worker and therefore amount to speculation territorial fighting and seldom escape from the confines of tradition  responsibility is not real ie no one is ultimately responsible for the quality of the student preparation  significant issues are not raised  for instance white middle class values and traditions are transmitted as though universal and equally applicable  content stands no real tests of relevancy or usefulness  planning is limited because the school does not have the range of faculty talents needed to make change miss bundy is a professor in the school of library and information services at the university of maryland this article originally appeared in the urban information specialist program first year presented by james welbourne director school of library and information services university of maryland june  
journal of education for librarianship  decisions regarding faculty appointments are not related to agreed upon objectives and therefore tend to be made on an ad hoc basis  admission criteria are not reviewed curriculum change therefore presupposes work role performance requires only graduation from college any type of subject background and that race and community background are irrelevant this model for change incorporates factors we have found to make for success in the urban information specialist program the key factor is speciality development based upon an identification with a client group and a type of work role rules of the game to begin the following are givens a the time to be allowed for this program is  hours two academic semesters and a summer session b only full time students will enter the program c students may enter the program in the fall and spring semesters d there will be a general core of  hours a specialty core of  hours and  hours of advanced work in the specialty e the faculty student ratio will be ten students for each full time faculty member optionah all resources of the school will be divided in proportion to the number of students being educated  library materials secretarial assistance etc all decisions including these givens are potentially reversible as the game proceeds players in the game and the stakes each member of the faculty should agree to trying this approach the group should reach an agreement to proceed with it at least up to some agreed upon point specialty group stakes are the number of students they are prepared to educate this gives them their right to resources and to decide what the nature of the instruction will be directions for playing the game can be played over varying periods of time it is recommended that stages one four be accomplished within a short period 
the educational change game of time so that effort can be put into the general core as other work proceeds a coordinator should probably be assigned to keep the program in motion groups may elect their own chairman representatives to larger groups meetings etc a method for reaching agreements must be decided upon it is hoped that the group will move toward consensus rather than remaining dependent upon the vote one objective of this approach is to help groups become task oriented as soon as possible it is strongly recommended that records be kept of what transpires during the playing of the game including using individual diary records of faculty members these records could be invaluable to others undertaking the same task stage one choice of work role the game begins by each faculty member making two individual choices the client community with which he most identifies and one of the following work roles information interpreter information processor information manager client communities can be variously defined at this stage  chemists high school students etc one of the tasks of the groups will be to develop these work roles in a specific context but in general they may be viewed as an expansion of the traditional reference cataloging and management roles to include the handling of information rather than a primary book and bibliographic orientation stage two specialty grouping this is the most difficult and crucial step  the decision as to what will constitute the various specialties it is done by examining the various faculty choices and arriving at what seems to be a realistic number and types of groupings it involves formation of a group to include like interests if a group is too large it may mean splitting into parts at this stage the following kinds of questions should also enter what will be the demands from the field of practice for particular types of specialists where does the need lie in terms of unserved client groups in making these judgments look to the future have a positive view of the role of library education in shaping the profes
journal of education for librarianship sion and of the role the library profession can play in society confront the issue of social responsibility openly one or another faculty competency may not translate into a specialty for instance a school may have one specialist in a highly technical area where expansion of his specialty would not be warranted in terms of the faculty additions necessary and the likely demand for professionals in this area a faculty member could function independently as a supporting service staff member but it is highly desirable for each member to be a member of one or another specialty group an example of the type of groupings which might emerge would be a management information specialty concerned primarily with the management of large scale information services for government and industry an information interpreter work role in relation to high school clients largely middle class an emphasis to be on media an information interpreter role in relation to the urban poor a critical question of course remains every school cannot provide specialization in all needed areas and should not there still be simply a general librarian prepared our answer would be that we must move beyond the stage where students take a host of introductory courses but never do develop any degree of specialization if properly devised there can still be considerable individual development even after the student has elected his specialty choice stage three specialty analysis once the groups are formed they then go to work on making initial judgments in the following areas  nature of the tasks people in this specialty should be able to perform  what people need to know to perform these tasks  what characteristics personal and educational and other experiences students should have upon entry  what content and abilities should the program provide  what particular teaching methods and approaches are desirable see the attached listing of the urban information specialist program as an example of what is involved preferably during this stage but no later than stage six each group should form a field advisory committee composed of knowledgeable 
the educational change game and affected persons librarians in the field working in the area members of the client community or community leaders students who have an interest in this area this committee should work with the group through the remainder of the game resource consultants can also be employed by the groups as they consider one or another problem or issue stage four development of the common core each group now sends a representative to form a group to work on the general core theoretically the core will consist of these elements which are found to be common to all specialties but readjustments may grow out of group dialogue on this issue development of the common core should proceed concurrently with specialty activities teachers for the core will be supplied by each specialty group on varying bases  to teach a course lecture on a subject etc the object here is for the specialties to gain the advantage of sharing the core relieves the specialty group of having to offer elements they either are not prepared to offer or which would deplete their faculty resources stage five bartering as planning continues groups now look to sharing between specialties such as having a common course lending a faculty member to a group in exchange for another for instance an information interpreter role specialty might want to have their students have more work related to the design of information services than is to be provided in the common core they would turn to that specialty group for faculty expertise a course might be developed for the interpreter group oriented toward their particular interests or it might be decided that their students would take a course in the other specialty we have used the term course throughout because it defines time dimensions but do not be limited to this traditional set consider a range of possibilities  individual and group field experiences major professional and research projects imaginative use of consultants variations in the time allotted to the mastery of particular contents if your specialty involves moving into uncharted territory you may wish to adopt a discovery investigative mode throughout the educational experience 
journal of education for librarianship stage six realization this phase involves further study bringing in experts faculty field trips etc it should move toward fairly concrete plans student selection criteria should be specified and plans for recruitment of students worked out needs for new faculty based upon the identification of competencies required should be defined at this stage some of the original game decisions may be changed in the light of group goals and feasibility evidence can be collected to support proposals if changes are going to involve review by a university group or require additional funding some general school decisions may also develop out of this planning such as a requirement for field experience we recommend however that groups be given the maximum of flexibility in order to respond to their particular client and work role commitments for instance one specialty might call for a good deal of course work outside the school but another specialty may not the essential task for each group is the planning of the educational preparation of x people in its particular specialty stage seven testing out a means should be devised for a mock run students coming fresh to the endeavor can be asked to look at the total program which would evolve and asked to respond to how these various choices would seem to affect them in these and other ways the kinks can be ironed out of the plans and unanticipated consequences identified stage eight implementation finally the faculty of the school must reach decisions about how to implement their revised curriculum they may wish to develop a three year plan including the phasing out of the existing program one or another specialty might run on an experimental basis before the others begin we did not include a doctoral component in this scheme but it could be incorporated by having each specialty consider itself to have a research arm the various specialties could cooperate to form a common doctoral experience as they did with the general core prospective game players are advised that this game has never been played before it might be better to wait until someone else tries it first
