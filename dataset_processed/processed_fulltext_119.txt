google books libraries and self respect information justice beyond distributions anna lauren hoffmann abstract if google books has been successful in furthering the cause of social justice with regard to information it is along narrowly distributive lines drawing on critics of distributive justice and emphasizing the value of self respect the author argues that googles massive digital scanning initiativeespecially as compared to the liberal democratic institution of the public library exposes and exacerbates injustices with regard to information technology and institutions that are not easily captured along distributive lines in particular attention is paid to three features of the projectthe quality of googles book scans the politics of online search and googles conception of the value of informationas demonstrative of the too slender foundation for self respect the google books project offers its users in the years since the inception of google books much has been written about its sup posed benefits possible pitfalls and relationship to libraries proponents have defended theproject by pointing to its potential for expanding social and economic opportunities through a heightened egalitarianism of information schmidt  par  this sentiment was echoed in judge denny chins november  decision ruling that googles book scanning efforts were protected by fair use critics on the other hand have been hesitant to fully embrace google books arguing that the project may ultimately subvert the promises of equality and opportunity that it claims to further siva vaidhyanathans  the googlization of everything for example carefully considers the consequences of surrendering control of the worlds knowledgein the digital realm at leastto a private company other discussions warn that googles values of efficiency and technical rationality have come to supplant the liberal democratic values traditionally bestowed upon books by libraries and threaten to compromise intellectual freedom and other expressive liberties waller  grimmelmann  zimmer   authors guild v google inc  civ  ðdc þ see httpswwwefforgdocumentopinion granting summary judgment fair use library quarterly information community policy vol  no  pp    by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
google books libraries and self respect   these discussions invoke broad questions of liberty equality and social justice with regard to access to information today however despite googles claims that it is furthering social justice by means of a heightened egalitarianism of information few discussions about the project have thoroughly or explicitly engaged google books according to broader theories of social justice in this article i outline the achievements of the project as defended by proponents and argue that if google books is indeed successful at furthering the cause of social justice and information it is successful along narrowly distributive lines simply attending to the expanded distribution of books overlooks other features and valuesin particular the value of self respectrelevant to the pursuit of social justice as demonstrated by critics of distributive justice in particular i draw attention to three dimensions of the books project thatcompared to the liberal democratic institution of the public libraryprovide too slender a basis for the development of self respect for its users a the quality of googles book scans b the politics of online search and c googles conception of information i conclude that although google books successes may work toward social justice in one regard the project ultimately exposes and exacerbates other injustices with regard to information technology and self respect today leading us to overlook the value bestowed on books by the context within which they are embedded google books a brief history of wild success google first launched its book scanning initiative in  furthering the companys stated mission to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful google inc  the project aims to do to the worlds collection of printed books what the company has already done for web pages index their contents analyze their connections and make them searchable in the first few years of the projects development google sought support from publishers willing to contribute in print books to the collectionan effort now known as the partner program grimmelmann  in  google announced its google print library project google inc  initially driven by partnerships with libraries at the university of michigan harvard oxford stanford and the new york public library the goal of the library project wasand remainsto scan entire library collections for inclusion in the companys books database for google the library project held more promise than the partner program for the rapid growth of its collection since it granted access to many millions of titles with only a handful of partnerships compared to just hundreds of titles made available by thousands of publishers newman   in  google print was renamed google books in order to better communicate the initiatives mission to the public google inc  although partnerships with libraries helped rapidly expand googles collection of book scans various interest groups and publishers objected that googles development and maintenance of a vast archive of library collections for commercial benefit represented a violation of copyright newman  samuelson  in  the authors guild of america and several
  the library quarterly individual authors brought a lawsuit against google maintaining that the books project was a violation of copyright law grimmelmann   in  a settlement was proposed that would haveamong other thingsreleased google from liability for both past and future scanning efforts in exchange for  million in compensation grimmelmann   the initial settlement was met with much criticism ranging from concerns over issues of privacy and copyright policy to accusations that google was being granted an unfair monopoly over the digital books market grimmelmann  zimmer  in response to these concerns parties to the lawsuit proposed an amended settlement in  the court rejected the amended settlement in march  as none of the lawsuits forced google books offline or prevented google from continuing its scanning efforts the project was able to move forward despite litigation eventually google books settled into the broader information ecosystem of the web the everyday utility of google books proved central to judge chins november  decision ruling that googles book scanning efforts were fair use as james grimmelmann  notes the current position of google books might have seemed unlikely in the early days of the lawsuit when googles book scanning was new and scary but the ruling demonstrates just how much the world has changed since google began its program nine years ago book scanning has become domesticated and its benefits are easy to see what was once viewed almost as science fiction has become part of our daily realityeveryone it seems has used google books par  in his decision judge chin cited as primary benefits of the project increased and efficient access to books new possibilities for quantitative research of texts improved access for disabled persons as with text to speech capabilities for digitized text and the granting of new life to otherwise neglected and out of print works authors guild v google inc   he also argued that the service ultimately aidsrather than damagesauthors and publishers since google links to retailers where a reader or researcher can purchase commercially available titles authors guild v google inc   in his simplest assessment judge chin argued that indeed all society benefits from google books authors guild v google inc   the ruling affirmed the optimism of proponents that have long touted the projects social economic and educational potential this potential is perhaps best captured by former google ceo eric schmidt writing in the wall street journal in  imagine sitting at your computer and in less than a second searching the full text of every book ever written imagine an historian being able to instantly find every book that mentions the battle of algiers imagine a high school student in bangladesh discovering an out of print author held only in a library in ann arbor imagine one giant electronic card catalog that makes all the worlds books discoverable with just a few keystrokes by anyone anywhere anytime par  nearly a decade later the possibilities of google books are no longer the stuff of imagination in purely dis to date the project has scanned more than  or  million books depending on the source howard  darnton 
google books libraries and self respect   tributive terms googles massive digital scanning initiative has been wildly successfulit has made available online an unprecedented number of books many of which would otherwise be inaccessible to the wider public a focus on googles distributive successes however tends to distract from other dimensions of the books project that are also important to the realization of social justice with regard to information for example simple discussions of expanded access make no reference to the value bestowed on books in particular contexts nor do they help us understand the role of information institutions in supporting the development of individuals self respect to better address these issues in the case of google books it is necessary to attend to the usefulness and limitations of distributive justice before introducing nondistributive dimensions relevant to the projects assessment beyond distributions information social justice and self respect the importance of distributive justicethat is the ways in which a society distributes rights responsibilities and resourceshas dominated liberal political philosophical discussions since the midtwentieth century john rawlss  a theory of justice represents the paradigmatic example offering in the first instance a standard whereby the distributive aspects of the basic structure of society are to be assessed  in this tradition individuals are conceived of as a possessing some more or less complete set of valued aims aspirations or ends and b as capable of adopting more or less effective means to those ends to pursue valued ends however individuals need resources these resourcessometimes referred to as primary goods are considered indispensible to advancing the ends of citizens understood as free and equal cohen   rawlss  list of primary goods includes among other things basic rights and liberties positions of responsibility in political and economic institutions income and wealth and the social bases of self respect  as primary goods liberties such as freedoms of conscience and association for example offer people the means to communicate and share ideas in order to develop or revise their valued ends similarly income and wealth provide the material means needed to effectively pursue ones plans many of the most robust accounts of social justice and information focus on information as a primary good like rights or income information is construed as instrumentally important for rational life planning and furthering human interests peter drahos  argues that persons need more than equal rights and liberties to develop and pursue plans and make decisionsthey also need information  jeroen van den hoven and emma rooksby  note that the idea of forming revising and pursuing a rational plan subject to the conditions that confront one hardly makes sense without assuming that information relevant to the task is relatively easy to come by  after all drahos  writes the more information  it should be noted that the idea of primary goods as an appropriate metric of justice in the first place has been called into question see sen  nussbaum  for a more complete account of the debate between primary goods advocates and capabilities theorists see henry brighouse and ingrid r robeyns 
  the library quarterly people have about the world to which their desires purposes and goals relate the more specific their plans can be  conversely in a world where the amount of information available for planning was ever diminishing a point would be reached where planning could not take place  these and related discussions capture the instrumental importance of information to the pursuit of human ends understanding information as a primary good also helps orient us toward problems of information inequality exacerbated by the rapid development and adoption of advanced information and communication technologiesit helps us conceive of and offer normative prescriptions for attending to inequalities in the distribution of information lipinski and britz  van dijk  duff  commonly these prescriptions take the form of both positive and negative information rights in negative terms information rights give expression to the idea that people should not be hindered in their efforts to access information as evidenced in censorship debates and freedom to read campaigns drahos  for example suggests a negative freedom of information to sit alongside other basic liberties such as freedom of expression  in positive terms information rights support claims that information should be provided for and made accessible by the state or other responsible agencies for example through libraries or open records policies van den hoven and rooksby  support information rights in a positive sense when they argue for equal opportunity with regard to information access since ensuring a just distribution of information requires not only a just distribution of information liberties for all citizens but also mechanisms to ensure that peoples opportunities to exercise their information liberties are roughly equal  alistair s duff  even goes so far as to rank all possible types of information and put forward a precise theorem for distributing information according to its importance however the dominance of distributive concerns represents a particular limitation of much reasoning about social justice today by reducing issues of social justice and information to purely distributive terms all we are left to talk about are problems of distribution critics of distributive justice such as iris marion young  have argued that while patterns of the distribution of resources opportunities and income are very important issues of justice theoretical focus on them    pays too little attention to the processes that produce the distributions    and obscures important aspects of structural processes that do not fit well under a distributive paradigm  leftist theorists for example point to imbalances in economic decision making power arguing that distributions of goods cannot account for structural processes that allow such power to be concentrated in relatively few hands disabilities scholars have shown how normative standards of ability shape our world in ways that are biased as when buildings without wheelchair access impose a normative standard of mobility that excludes many otherwise capable persons these discussions are attuned to the ways that the design of social economic and physical institutions structure decision making power and im
google books libraries and self respect   pose normative standards that are relevant to social justice but are not necessarily reducible to matters of distribution with regard to information johannes j britz  argues that contemporary reasoning about social justice and information should go beyond distributions to include among other things appropriate recognition of the equal worth and dignity of all people justice as recognition the active facilitation of opportunities for people to meaningfully participate in economic or political activities justice as participation and an understanding of the generative role principles of justice can play in fostering a sense of justice among a population justice as generation  also patterns of distribution cannot tell us much about the ways information is collected stored analyzed or presentedonly about the ways in which it is disseminated further distributive justice values information only as generally instrumental for setting and pursuing particular endsit makes no reference to the meaning or value bestowed upon goods outside distributions or in particular contexts walzer  simply attending to googles expanded distribution of books leads us to overlook the value bestowed on books by the context within which they are embedded one dimension of social justice routinely obscured by a focus on distributions is selfrespect philosophers such as elizabeth telfer  stephen darwall   and robin dillon  have long articulated the importance of personal dignity and self respect for social justice even rawls  counts the social bases of self respect in his list of primary goods going so far as to call self respect perhaps the most important primary good  more recently stand alone pieces in political philosophy regarding rawlss conception of selfrespect have further reinforced its importance for both rawls and for theories of social justice generally doppelt  zink  at the same time the rise of the capabilities approach to justice has generated valuable discussions of the ways in which distributions of primary goods are insufficient for fully supporting the development of persons self respect nussbaum  self respect is important to social justice in at least two ways first it serves as an important evaluative criterion in selecting a conception of justice if a conception provides a more robust foundation for the development of self respect than do other conceptions and discourages countervailing attitudes such as envy or spite then that is to count as a reason in favor of its selection for example rawls  argues that because his theory supports self respect founded on the priority and equal protection of basic liberties and not other considerations such as income or wealth his conception of social justice ought to be selected over others in particular over utilitarian conceptions  second self respect confers upon indi respectively britzs account of justice as recognition participation and generation draws on lotter  sen  and young   more precisely rawls argues that these features make his theory more stable than others his so called argument from stability for a more thorough account of the justificatory role of self respect for rawls see zink 
  the library quarterly viduals a sense of their own value and a conviction that their plans of life are worth pursuing rawls   individuals in possession of self respect have both the motivation and confidence needed to pursue their valued ends zink   conversely a lack of selfrespectas manifested for example in a submission to indignities or a lack of concern over whether one is taken seriously darwall  can undermine an individuals ability to set revise or pursue his or her aims it is important to recognize that self respect on this second account is not only a matter of individual motivation but is also socially contingent in perhaps his most eloquent statement on the topic rawls  points out that our self respect which mirrors our sense of our own worth depends in part upon the respect shown to us by others no one can long possess an assurance of his own value in the face of enduring contempt or even the indifference of others  importantly individuals participate in multiple contexts of evaluation including networks of friends family neighborhood church workplaces political citizenship national identity all of which come to bear on an individuals sense of self doppelt   consequently the development of self respect is intimately tied to ones place within a larger culture and whether or not that culture forces particular social roles upon certain categories of people okin   the relationship between societal structures and self respect is explicit in discussions of institutionalized injustice along the lines of race ethnicity sexuality or gender both laurence thomas  and bernard r boxill   for example have shown how the american civil rights movement was not only a process of winning rights for african americans but also a matter of liberating self respect michele m moody adams  makes it clear that the possibilities for individuals to develop self respect are constrained by normative standards of race and privilege embedded in social political and economic structures similarly heteronormative standards of sexuality shape possibilities for self respect for bisexual and homosexual individuals mohr  whereas cisnormative standards of binary gender constrain the development of self respect for transgender or gender nonconforming individuals for people with disabilities social circumstances question disabled peoples equal social bases of selfrespect as for example through the reactions by other people to the way they look act or simply to the way they are terzi   the cumulative force of these discussions lays bare the influence of factors such as social norms built environments and other entrenched political structures on self respect attending to problems of self respect in information then means paying attention to the structures and systems that permit access unfortunately and as noted by dillon  the relevance of respect to moral evaluations of informational or technology systems has received relatively little attention  nonetheless information institutions and the technologies and systems they employ necessarily serve certain goals or interests better than others brey   working to empower some and disempower othersand not in equal measure in the next
google books libraries and self respect   section i argue that a focus on self respect offers one way to move beyond distributive concerns in order to complicate the accepted successes of google books google books versus libraries as sites of self respect to be clear pointing to the limits of distributive justice and foregrounding the value of selfrespect do not mean unjust distributions of information are unimportant as the too brief discussion in the previous section shows attending to distributions is an indispensable part of realizing social justice today but at the same time it is not simply a matter of technological wonder that google books enables an imagined bangladeshi high school student access to an out of print text in michigan rather understanding the limits of distributive justice reminds us that information is ultimately accessed in context through institutions and systems dialectically shaped by the information they distribute information both informs and is informed by the values and contexts of providing institutions and systems in this section three features of the books projectthe quality of scans the black box  of search and googles conception of informationare presented and discussed each of these features presents a challenge to the otherwise accepted successes of the books project in particular it is argued that compared to libraries googles massive collection of book scans presents too slender a base for supporting the development of persons self respect in any broad or robust sense the quality of scans anecdotal evidence of errors and distortions within google books has been available for years the art of google booksa blog dedicated to capturing distortions in googles book scans and presenting them as aesthetic objectshas documented many hundreds of errors from distorted pages to scans partially obscured by human fingers goldsmith  according to medieval historian ronald musto  these distortions offer a mutilated view of the past encoded in texts rushed through the scanning process so that google could lay claim to as many artifacts of our cultural past in as short a time and with as small a budget as possible musto  par  more systematic attempts to address the issue of quality have proved challenging as the massive size of the books project makes it difficult to assess the overall quality of googles scans or metadata records in one study paul duguid  zeroed in on a single textthe life and opinions of tristram shandy gentlemanto assess the quality presented to an ordinary user that google envisages wanting to find a book par  his analysis revealed a number of issues immediately relevant to a casual reader scans accompanied by inconsistent or missing metadata text lopped off at the margins and most egregiously the outright removal of the books iconic solid black page inserted by the author after the death of one of the storys characters par  other work has attempted to document errors across a range of pages and texts but findings have varied greatly depending on the parameters of a given analysis gevinson 
  the library quarterly james  conway  reports concerns that the pervasiveness of low level errors undermines the digitization standards set by other information institutions and normalizes lower standards as simply the cost of building such a massive collection  beyond low level errors the random distribution of fatal errors that is errors that render a text entirely unfit for use in the collection also undermines its trustworthiness conway  further errors or inconsistencies in the scanning process have been shown to produce poor or inconsistent metadatafor example absent or missing scans for particular recordsthat further undermine the authority and reliability of the collection nunberg  chen  from a pragmatic perspective the existence of hundredsindeed even many thousands of such errors is to be expected from a digital scanning initiative more concerned with the dramatic expansion of access than with the achievement of quality standards set by preservationists or scholars leetaru  from this perspective the existence of low level error is unimportant since as conway  admits such errors do not generally hinder reading consequently poor quality scans and metadata can be dismissed as a necessary trade off in the effort to expand accessin order to widely distribute digital versions of library collections online pragmatic matters of cost and time must be taken into consideration in nondistributive terms however the unreliable access afforded by google books serves to recast rather than overcome the problem of an egalitarianism of information as one between those with ready access to alternative information institutions and those whose access to the worlds books is mediated almost entirely by the standards set by google these persistent issues of institutional access and privilege are intimately bound up with the development of self respect the subpar access described by duguid  for example does not communicate to an ordinary user that her or his reading experience is valued more highly than googles desire to quickly and efficiently index massive collections of books moreover the random distribution of fatal error and inconsistent metadata has the potential to frustrate and undermine the confidence of users without access to the additional information seeking and research support that make up important parts of the value of libraries this is not to say that there are no benefits to the massive collection google has developed but it does resist the notion that google books has gone very far in realizing a heightened egalitarianism of information in any broad sense understanding the importance of institutional access and privilege for self respect in particular calls attention to the ways google books might instead point to further injustices in access to information privilege and power  a reviewer of this article pointed out that anyone with an internet connection has access to resources other than google books although this is an important note it does not undermine the books projects overall dominance for example competitors such as the open content alliance or project gutenberg may represent alternative resources but they cannot compete with google books in terms of volume further more than  of the hathitrust digital librarys  million book scans come from google york  conway  as a practical reality then google books has become the dominant digital library in the worldnot only as a stand alone resource but also as the backbone for other projects  for assessing the value of public libraries in particular see jaeger et al 
google books libraries and self respect   the black box of search google employs a range of tools and considerations in facilitating access to information across googles various services users rely on seemingly simple search tools that conceal the complex interplay of computer algorithms commercial interests linguistic cues metadata and personalized settings that the company uses to deliver results as lucas introna  notes much contemporary information technology works this waythings such as computer algorithms are subsumed and black boxed in ways that are not evident obvious transparent or open to inspection by the ordinary everyday person  importantly this black box  keeps important questions of ethics and politics hidden from plain view leaving technology as such    unproblematised and overlooking the ways it excludes some and not others irrespective of whether this was intended by the designers or not introna   as discussions of self respect normative biases and institutionalized injustice in the previous section suggest however attending to such matters of inclusion and exclusion is an important nondistributive dimension of social justice in their seminal article shaping the web why the politics of search engines matters lucas introna and helen nissenbaum  brought to light various political and moral dimensions of search algorithms such as those employed by google they endeavored to show how the technical limitations of algorithmic search leads to systematic inclusions and exclusions    that dictate systematic prominence for some sites and systematic invisibility for others  with regard to googles web search for example it is well known that the companys pagerank algorithm examines not only the content of a web page but also the type and quality of the pages that link to it as a consequence pages with higher ranking tend to be more prominent in lists of search results for google then relevance is in large part continuous with popularity and visibilitythe search engine does not mitigate against arbitrary inequality but rather tends to mirror or exacerbate the uneven distribution of links on the web diaz   since the publication of introna and nissenbaums article scholars have continued to address problems of information bias censorship diversity and democratic deliberation as they relate to search engine technology hargittai  diaz  zimmer  driven by a desire to prevent online information from merely mimicking the power structure of the conglomerates that dominate the media landscape granka   more recently scholars have also shown how the design of googles search engine algorithms reinforces and perpetuates biases in the representation of particular minority groups for example noble  demonstrates the ways in which google search results for black girls reduce the identities of black women to only stereotypical or hypersexualized representations obscuring the social and political interests of an entire minority group in terms congenial to the present work the seeming objectivity of automated search results as articulated by noble serves to reinforce extant racist and sexist attitudes and deny black women a potential informational basis for establishing self respect
  the library quarterly of course any effort to organize the whole of human knowledge and experience into a set of discrete categories or search terms is inevitably reductionist incomplete and biased even compared to google search the systems for organizing information employed by libraries are far from perfect as library catalogs continue to perpetuate discrimination in their representations of certain subjects with regard to the library of congresss subject headings lcsh in particular notable wrongs include the continuing subjugation of women to men and the mishandling of feminist subjects olson  the foreclosure of opportunities for certain types of queer representation keilty  the historical maligning of homosexual identities adler  and a failure to recognize the long term social and economic impact of policy and funding decisions based on controversial classifications bowker and star  nonetheless the processes and institutions that produce and perpetuate biases in libraries are not as impervious to critique as is the black box  of googles proprietary algorithms sanford bermans  prejudices and antipathies a tract on the lc subject heads concerning people for example forcefully demonstrated the problems of western white and religious bias reflected in the lcsh and proposed a series of changes to remedy them although it is estimated that only about  of bermans suggestions have been implemented knowlton  the effective redress of representational wrongs is possibleand in the case of lcsh ongoing johnson  berman  at any rate the comparative accessibility of an explicit and widely disseminated controlled vocabulary such as the lcsh offers a more secure foundation for protest and the exercise of self respect than the opaque and ever shifting black box of search technology this relative impenetrability is especially troubling in light of the power google has to direct and shape the flow of information online determining what content to display and what content to ignore in response to a given query googles conception of information following vivienne waller  libraries and google are ultimately informed by radically different conceptions of the value of information for public libraries in particular the value of information is informed by its role in promoting and preserving a liberal democratic ideal it is the grand tradition of the contemporary public library that ready and equitable access to information is integral to a functioning democracy mccolvin  waller  as john buschman  describes libraries support the existence of a robust public sphere in the habermasian sense enacting the principle of critique and rational argumentation through the commitment to balanced collections preserving them over time and furthering inclusion through active attempts to make collections and resources reflect historical and current intellectual diversity  in addition the tradition of progressive librarianship has helped imbue library rhetoric and practice with a commitment to intellectual freedom that readily ac for the value of protest for realizing self respect see boxill
