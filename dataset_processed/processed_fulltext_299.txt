library operations research a process of discovery and justification ferdinand f leimkuhler abstract this article begins with a discussion of the broad role of operations research  r in a society undergoing change the nature of  r teams in a library environment is then considered the function of models in  r is analyzed the development of a model being contrasted with its formal presentation criteria for good models are suggested this article then focuses on storage models for libraries first considering the dewey classification system from this perspective and then summarizing more current research carried out under the direction of the author with a grant from the national science foundation operations research o r is the art of using the scientific method to help understand and solve sociotechnical problems it focuses attention on managerial decision making in times of crisis and change it did not originate from any direct heave ho of poetic strength as marshall mcluhan  puts it but as an expedient way for society to adjust to situations in which technologies and cultures are mixed mcluhan says that operations research programs the hybrid principle as a technique of creative discovery operations research began with the study of military logistics in world war ii and has since become an integral part of the military organization today it is flourishing in the industrial world in support of corporate planning and adjustment to the introduction of computer based management information systems at the same time a very substantial beginning has been made in the application of  r to the largescale complex problems in the public sector library  r is part of this latter development as a creative activity  r can serve an important prophetic role by anticipating future social and technical developments mcluhan argues that it is very difficult for man to understand the environment in which he lives only when new technologies come along and create new cultures do we become aware of the older environment which is replaced or rather incorporated into the new one man prefers to go into the future looking backward and as the old is justified in terms of the new man begins to perceive more fully the structural properties and components of the older environment the power of the arts to anticipate future cultural developments has long been recognized mcluhan quotes ezra pound who called the artist the antennae of the race by taking a position which is essentially antienvironmental or countercultural the artist can train his powers of perception and judgment about the nature and implications of environmental change today new technologies and their consequent environments succeed each other in such rapid succession that technology itself is performing the function of art in making us aware of the psychic and social consequences of technological development 
library operations research  the meeting of two environments in the clash of new and old technologies is a time of action and hybrid energy it is also a moment of truth and revelation a particularly favorable time to observe the forces of change in society in these periods of transition society needs a science of change not only to help man to adapt to environmental changes but much more important to help chart and hold a steady course toward more permanent goals even amidst the most disrupting innovations mcluhan believes that man is beginning to learn the futility of changing goals in order to accommodate technical change operations research is a way of making a systematic inquiry into the problematic relationship between organizational goals and the possibilities of technical innovation a team approach in the field of library and information science a relatively small but substantial beginning has been made one which has been largely financed with federal support to some libraries but more often to university professors and their students for this reason one might say that libraries have been more useful to  r than has  r been useful to libraries university libraries are excellent and convenient laboratories in which to have students develop their skills in this field and to engage in scholarly studies of the managerial and systems design problems of service organizations and educational institutions while it is true that this research has not always been directed toward the immediate benefit of the local library since the researcher may have a mixture of motives and the federal funder may be seeking results of much more general significance the quality and relevance of the work that has been done may be as good as or even better than the work being done in other areas what is missing is the presence of more permanent in house  r teams which can concentrate on model implementation as well as model development the small multidiscipline team approach is an essential feature of  r since only a group of men can provide competence in the variety of disciplines and techniques that are needed in the study of broad problems an in house team takes on the characteristics of the organization it serves thus when  r spread from the military to industry there was a substitution of industrial engineering talent for mechanical engineering and a substitution of econometricians and other behavioral scientists for physical scientists at the same time the military management and engineering schools of the country began to develop specialized programs in the field a typical  r team may consist of two scientific types two engineering types and one or two people from the behavioral or administrative sciences they tend to report in a staff capacity to the vice presidential level of a corporation and are more concerned with long range planning and development than with day to day operations it is not obvious what mixture of talent would best serve a library  r group early experience has shown that people with backgrounds in applied mathematics statistics computer science industrial engineering the physical sciences sociology psychology and economics can make significant contributions a fiveor six person team with training in some of these areas and a fair amount of professional library
 ferdinand f leimkuhler experience should make an excellent beginning it is difficult of course to muster the funds for such ventures and perhaps most libraries will have to depend on larger organizations for  r support either at the university level or in association with other libraries the wiche consortium of universities and colleges  supports  r and systems development work on a national level and works closely with applications people at participating institutions a similar arrangement is being followed for the nine campuses of the university of california in the library systems development program of the institute of library research  in addition libraries can secure  r services from management consulting groups but the difficulty in using outside help is the possible lack of understanding experience and commitment in the formulation and solution of library type problems thus it is difficult to escape the need for library professionals to take the initiative in both the direction of  r activities and participation in the work itself credibility industrial operations researchers have come to learn that credibility is the major factor in getting support for their work as harvey wagner  says just like pregnancy there is no such thing as a little credibility either an executive believes that the  r approach to his problems is valid and useful or he dismisses the whole thing as worthless apparently there are enough managers who are believers and enough operations researchers who are successful andor cautious since in a relatively short period of time it is estimated that over half of the major firms in the united states have established corporate  r groups and that in the next ten years the remaining half are expected to join the ranks of the believers operations research can be a relatively expensive undertaking and it is a long term high risk research investment for this reason there is a tendency to build an  r program slowly around a few carefully chosen studies which will tend to promote confidence within both the group and the organization wagner stresses the fact that the  r effort must always be directed toward management systems considerations that is the results must eventually be integrated into the information decision making and control structure of the organization the study cannot be undertaken in isolation from the surrounding organizational environment and must ultimately be considered part of a total systems effort wagner believes that many  r projects fail because it is not realized that implementation must begin on the very first day of the project the managers who are expected to act on the results must be involved at the start and the analysts must always be prepared to modify their models in accordance with changes in the organizational environment changes which the  r effort may precipitate an important factor leading to misunderstanding and lack of credibility on the part of managers is the language of the discipline in  r the model is the message operations research models are problem statements in solution format and therefore are a very precise way of stating a problem because the solution is usually a mathematical one the problems are stated in a highly idealized manner and may not be rec
library operations research  ognizable to a manager confronting a similar real world problem the literature of  r follows the custom in science of reporting work in the manner which logically justifies the inferences made usually these justifications have little relation to the psychological process by which the really valuable discoveries were made and the essential features of a model were fixed in the analyst mind nevertheless a model is never fully accepted in  r circles until it has been justified in a scientific manner this means listing the assumptions and deductive steps needed to draw relevant conclusions from the model and giving an orderly description of the design and analysis of experiments aimed at testing hypotheses suggested by the model also a good bit of attention may be given to showing how this model differs from and relates to other models reported in the literature modeling william morris  in his excellent essay on modeling points out that many people tend to confuse the ad hoc justification of models in scientific papers with descriptions of the modelbuilding process itself morris believes that the process by which an experienced analyst arrives at a model of a management problem is essentially an intuitive one a thorough familiarity with the model literature and the methods of logical justification can be of great help in the discovery process but it is not a substitute for the creativity needed in model building descriptions of the modeling process are hard to find analysts learn by doing and they like to define  r as what  r people do experienced analysts are reluctant to give much formal attention to this part of their work they tend to dismiss questions about their choice of variables environmental factors and solution techniques as either too trivial to bother with or too nontrivial to be answered and yet it is this aspect which is crucial to an understanding and appreciation of  r work morris tries to be more explicit and suggests three hypotheses about modeling  it is a process of enrichment or elaboration one begins with a very simple model quite distinct from reality and moves toward more elaborate models which more nearly reflect the complexity of the actual management situation this seems obvious but it is important and does take a certain amount of poise to confront a complicated problem with a simple model in which one deliberately suppresses consideration of the complicated realities  analogy and association with similar models and problem situations often determines the starting point in model building this is why the experienced analyst can often get a head start on the model  modeling involves two sorts of looping or alternating procedures a alternations between modifications of the model and confrontation by data and b alternation between exploration of the deductive tractability of the model and the assumptions which characterize it this is the most important and the hardest part of model building striking the proper balance between descriptive realism and mathematical sophistication is no easy trick it involves a great deal of trial and error and sensitivity testing the end product is essentially an approximation elaborate enough to capture the essen
 ferdinand f leimkuhler tials yet gross enough to yield computable solutions morris gives several useful tips on modeling and lists five criteria for good models these are  relatedness to other  r models and techniques  transparency or ease of interpretation intuitive satisfaction  robustness or sensitivity to the assumptions made  fertility or richness in deductive possibilities  ease of enrichment or ability to modify and expand the model others may quibble over this list but it serves the purpose of suggesting what modelers are thinking about as they stew over a problem obviously this process is not going to yield uniform results in every application harvey wagner notes how he is struck by the way those  r experts who have perfected certain modeling techniques are able to tackle almost every problem they encounter with their own specialty such as linear programming dynamic programming queueing theory etc he believes their ability to do this and do it successfully attests more to their personal genius than it does to the flexibility of the techniques they use usefulness in some areas of application there have been enough models developed for the same kind of problem that it is now possible to practice a little  r on  r itself that is to develop a model for the problem of selecting an  r model for solving a problem recently william souder  made such a study of the many models over forty which have been proposed for the purposes of allocating resources among risky research programs in order to establish criteria and to weigh their importance in evaluating such models he polled  experienced research administrators and management scientists from this survey thirty six significant factors were identified grouped into five main categories of suitability and assigned ranks and weights the five categories which souder calls model features are as follows in the rank order of their importance  realism or accuracy in representing real world systems  flexibility or applicability to various kinds of problems  capability to perform various kinds of computational analysis  usefulness or ease of application and comprehension  cost or the expense of setting up and running the model the thirty six criteria associated with these features are listed below realism multiple objectives multiple constraints orthogonal variables market risk variable technical risk variable manpower limits parameter facility limits parameter budget limits parameter data uncertainty variable premises uncertainty variable flexibility applied projects basic projects priority decisions initiation decisions budget allocation applications project funding applications capability future times analyses optimization analyses simulation analyses selection analyses

 ferdinand f leimkuhler up and make them march on command rather it is a kind of knowledge about knowledge and if knowledge is a form of power as the familiar slogan claims bibliographic control is in a certain sense power over power this mastery he says is not only the knowledge of the contents of texts it is knowledge of all uses to which texts can be put by all possible users in all possible circumstances we shall never in this world have such control but the ideal is an intelligible one he footnotes this with a proof of the impossibility of building a universal bibliographic machine without ruling out the possibility of machines of limited power granted that bibliographic control or some limited form of it is the aim of a library where does the  r analyst begin he could begin by finding a harried librarian and ask him to describe some problems and see if any lend themselves to mathematical formulation this is not such a bad way to start as it may seem at first glance it has the important advantage of motivating the analyst and the librarian to become engaged in a common cause at the outset there is greater assurance of an initial success if the analyst starts from a position of mathematical technique alone he runs the risk of having his so called real world problem evaporate it would be better to rely on the hypothesis that if experienced librarians have not been able to find a satisfying solution to a problem the answer is not obvious furthermore if the problem is really meaningful to the library environment then one can be assured that no matter where you start you will begin to converge on the more central issues and problems in library operations because modeling is an evolutionary process of enrichment and elaboration there is a built in quest for an ultimate model which will define the library problem the analyst should eventually consult the large literature on librarianship if only to find justifications for current library practice and arguments against it for example it is difficult to proceed far in storage problems without recognizing the influence of great analytic minds like that of melvil dewey the most commonly used book storage system used in american libraries today is based on dewey decimal classification and relative index model which he first published in  by drawing on the properties of the mathematical notion of the real line the decimal system is a relatively simple logical way of arranging items in an orderly linear way it makes possible the insertion of an unlimited amount of new materials while maintaining a fixed relationship according to subject matter the relevance pattern must be a hierarchic one and is dependent on the somewhat arbitrary decision as to which two adjacent items relate most closely to the new one that is inserted between them it is a testimony to the ingenuity of librarians that they have been able to make this system work so well and so long in the assembling of both small and large collections the very practical advantage of the decimal system is that many patrons can and will serve themselves how well they do this is difficult to ascertain but it does make it possible for libraries to operate in a largely selfservice manner which has enormous economic advantages author and title guides are provided for the user who

 ferdinand f leimkuhler themselves into a quite astonishingly new synthesis rider solution was the microcard forerunner of the present day microfiche in this way he helped discover a new medium which is becoming increasingly important to libraries however in looking at his invention in retrospect it seems that he has preserved the essential character of the conventional library he proposed organizing a microform library in subject catalog format just as the conventional library is already in principle an enormous subject catalog of books in this sense then rider suggestion is essentially a change of scale it was only a year after rider published his work that vannevar bush  introduced his notions of electronic memory systems using associative rather than hierarchic retrieval schemes along with some very advanced concepts of miniaturization his monumental article as we may think became the blueprint for the new field of information science which precipitated a technological battle between the computer and the book j c r licklider  says one must be prepared to reject not only the schema of the physical library which is essentially a response to books and their proliferation but the schema of the book itself and even that of the printed page as a long term storage device if one is going to discover the kinds of pro cognitive systems needed in the future he does not reject the schema of the computer retrieval problems contemporary with rider was the great british documentalist s c bradford bradford  focused attention on journals periodicals and serials serials storage is a significant departure from the decimal system for monographs serials are shelved by title and date of publication and therefore have built in age control and missing item control there is greater uniformity of size and ease in predicting shelf requirements there is also a considerable simplification in the procedures for getting new items on the shelf an advantage that is looking even more attractive as automatic order systems create bottlenecks in the cataloging procedures for monographs the importance of this medium is quite evident in the sciences and technology where it constitutes the bulk of the important literature one of the very significant differences between serials and monograph storage is that the problem of bibliographic control is largely the responsibility of the publisher and not the library searching in this medium is a chainlike process from item to item where each item is expected to have its own references to the next one this is like having the catalog imbedded in the material itself rather than trying to imbed the material into a catalog special retrieval services may be provided as guides to periodicals but this is almost always done outside the library proper this freedom from subject classification permits any one serial item such as a particular journal to change its subject contents radically over time and still maintain a fixed relative location on the library shelf the loss of local control is readily apparent when a library attempts to shelve an item in serial form which does not meet the standards of first rate journals in the provision of bibliographic controls and retrieval services such materials are
library operations research  virtually lost the moment they are shelved bradford study of the periodical literature was aimed at establishing bibliographic control his institutional solution was the establishment of a national lending library which would be a central depository and clearinghouse for most periodicals local libraries would hold small selective collections which could even be discarded while depending on the backup services of the central library the logic for his position rests on his so called law of scattering by which he sought to explain why the abstracting services consistently included only about a third of the articles actually published in scientific and technical journals although the total number of abstracts was about equal to the total number of articles bradford was disturbed by the amount of apparent duplication and showed empirically that the recognized articles on any one topic were distributed in a highly skewed manner over the journals publishing them thus trying to see every article on one topic becomes a herculean task but to see say half of these articles one might only have to search through about  percent of the journals carrying such articles bradford model can provide a rich starting point for the study of journal selection problems in a library or for the distribution of journal holdings over a branch library system or on a larger scale over a network of libraries technological developments going on in the world of librarianship and information science today are greatly enlarging the scope of the problem of bibliographic control and shifting the emphasis from storage and selection to larger problems of information retrieval and transfer these lead to the design and development of information retrieval systems which deliberately refuse to predicate their conceptual plan on the operations of a conventional library whether or not this is being done more as an exploratory tactic in the process of discovery or whether it is prophecy of the future remains to be seen as a technique for discovery one has to be willing to recognize the need for taking positions which are essentially counterenvironmental in order to test the integrity of that environment however as a forecast of the future there may be some comfort in knowing that the time of justification will come for the new technologies too and in that justification there is an implicit justification for the technology which is superseded library problems while problems of information awareness transfer and retrieval require reference to a much larger system environment there are many problems which remain within the domain of the local library among these are the problems of document selection storage and delivery these are practical problems involving the messy realities of limited budgets for acquisitions buildings with odd ball dimensions and exotic designs and funders and users with peculiar whims and preferences is this the kind of environment in which  r can flourish the answer would seem to depend on the way the library views itself if it is viewed as something obsolete or just making do then the library does not need  r if it is seen as a place without options and without goals of its own then there are no problems of this variety an alternate
 ferdinand f leimkuhler and more viable view would see the library as a microcosm of the larger bibliographic world of which it is one of the essential base points it would seek its justification in the larger environment and not depend solely on its own internal and perhaps obsolete validity if the library is open  r can be useful to the  r analyst the problems of the library have not been solved until they are no longer intellectually interesting and no longer socially useful certainly the problems of bibliographic control at the local level do not meet either of those criteria where library  r is done as an adjunct to its being taught on the campus a shotgun approach to problem formulation may result however a certain amount of wandering or random searching over the problem field must be expected from any truly creative  r effort this is true of the experience at purdue university where i have directed a library operations project over the past six years with support from the national science foundation office of science information service most of the studies made were related to the teaching programs of the university and resulted in masters theses and doctoral dissertations however this work was done as a team effort and in conformity with the objectives of the sponsor and the university library the library director and his staff were actively engaged in this work both as participants and as reviewers the first major study by cox  was made of book shelving problems this was followed by a series of related investigations raffel    perfected cox mathematical formulation in order to improve on his solution technique a subsequent application study in which he compared the model solutions with the actual shelving patterns in three branch libraries at purdue university was made by popovitch  oeill  developed efficient statistical techniques for gathering book shelving data the shelving model had implications for several other studies for example roberts  demonstrated its relationship to many industrial problems and to models for packaging and cutting steel and paper stock for inventories he applied it to the design of industrial warehouses recently ravindran  has developed a new solution technique using network or graph theory which greatly expands the model solution and application capability an interesting extension was made by sterling  who used the book shelving model to efficiently block marc ii bibliographic record on magnetic computer tapes of special significance was the recognition given to the use of these studies in the planning of princeton university volume auxilliary library the concern with library storage problems led directly to studies of depositories by lister  and mann  and of book usage models and retirement policies by jain  this led also to studies of the bradford distribution  and its application in information search and storage models by leimkuhler  and baker  oeill  used this work as a departure point for his study of journal productivity and library organization and kraft  drew on it in his study of the journal selection problem the focus on storage and selection models begged the question is this all there is to a library in response
