bibliographic instruction and mass media news literacy a theoretical background juris dilevko this article suggests that bibliographic instruction bi librarians consider integrating a mass media news literacy and awareness component into their teaching duties as the concentration of media power in the hands of a small number of corporate entities increases and as market driven management imperatives dominate publishing practices students should possess the skills to evaluate effectively and critically mass media sources such as mainstream newspapers and magazines to this end a theoretical framework for understanding mass media news influence is offered the concepts of agenda setting priming framing asymmetrical selection binary oppositionalism and institutional hegemony are explored in a survey of relevant literature from the fields of journalism and communications a teaching strategy incorporating these concepts is sketched out the strategy highlights one news event and compares how different news sources report that event through such an exercise students will be able to recognize how different news frames affect understanding of the topic in question ultimately the successful bi program will be defined by the extent to which students move away from a passive reading of news media sources to a position where they are able to decode the social context of mainstream news production and develop informed and negotiated reading practices introduction in the past two decades bibliographic instruction bi has become an important component of library reference work  there has been a concomitant increase in the number of articles dealing with some aspect of bi  two main trends the first much larger than the sec i would like to thank the three referees for their helpful and constructive suggestions in addition i would like to thank kalina grewal sociology and anthropology bibliographer york univenity toronto for her significaant contribuitions to the conceptualization of the various problems discussed in this article juris dilevko faculty of media and inforrnation studies middlesex college university of western ontario london ontario canada na b telephone     extension  fax    e mail jdilevkojulianuwoca library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved   
 the library quarterly ond are evident in this literature as sherri edwards has noted in her study of fifteen years of bi articles in library publications a clear majority of these articles continue to be position papers status reports and ow we did it good papers describing the best ways to familiarize students with the intricacies of various print and electronic sources  p  at the same time a relatively small number of researchers have called for the incorporation of critical thinking skills into bi classes despite the model statement of objectives for academic bibliographic instruction published by the bi task force of the association of college  research libraries in  this statement recommended that one of the goals of bi should be to make users aware of how information sources are structured and how the publisher reputation may affect the usefulness of the source  p  to be sure influential voices have called for a strong focus on critical thinking skills in bi programs cerise oberman believes that analysis synthesis and evaluation must be overt educational goals in bi if students are to end up with  the cognitive tools to make informed choices  pp   in another article oberman cautions librarians against focusing too much on technology during bi classes urging them instead to develop lessons which allow students the opportunity to learn the politics of information  p  taylor hubbard suggests that information must be studied in the context of the academic discourse that creates it  p  he states that bi librarians would do well to go back to foucault central question raised in the archaeology of knowledge  in order to structure their teaching efforts foucault question is simple who is speaking asking this question would result in bi that is radically different from current practices if information has its roots in human activity and its expression in human action hubbard writes the questions of authority    are worth considering in what we teach about information  p  a close examination of the assumptions underlying the text and its discourse should therefore play an essential part in teaching students about information sources hubbard believes diane nahl jakobovits and leon a jakobovits have developed a holistic approach to bi whose premise is that critical thinking skills must precede information retrieval information use and what they term information success  p  some concrete applications of the critical thinking movement have recently appeared for example virginia chappell et al discuss a series of library based evaluating sources workshops which make use of a number of historical and bibliographic sources about the meaning of war in society to help students uncover the history and terms of inquiry for a given issue and thus introduce processes of inquiry that are knowledge building not merely library using the specific advan
instruction and media news literacy  tage that these workshops enjoy is that they contextualize the text in order to make sense of it this form of rhetorical reading thus highlights the sociorhetorical constraints on discourse    and help s students understanding of the rhetorical strategies involved in the forwarding of knowledge claims  pp    in a similar vein sonia bodi created an exercise which helps students distinguish between scholarship defined as a fair minded attempt to represent a point of view and propaganda defined as a deliberate attempt to mislead or exaggerate some of the indicators of scholarship that she identifies are a willingness to describe the limits of the data to present alternative views to provide data that are not favorable to the preferred view and to admit ignorance  pp   while bi librarians are right to concentrate on teaching students how to approach academic sources critically it is nevertheless true that an important part of university level research deals with mass media information sources newspapers magazines and television yet library literature fails to deal specifically with the need to discuss with students critical thinking skills and strategies that they could apply to mass media news sources however as len masterman points out the need for inass media education is pressing he cites four main factors  the all pervasive presence of the internet television radio magazines and newspapers in both private and public spheres  the high consumption of these forms of media by the public  the ability of the media to set agendas and to influence consciousness through their power of presenting issues and images in circumscribed ways and  the rush to privatize information so that it becomes a commodity and hence subject to the supply and demand pressures of any ordinary commodity good in the private marketplace  p  scholarship in the fields of journalism and communications theory however has provided a rich theoretical framework about the structure and workings of mass media news moreover calls for renewed efforts to teach media awareness have recently given rise to a number of textbooks aimed at secondary school and university level educators   librarians especially those formally involved in bi activities should also have some understanding of the issues involved in the development structure and influence of mass media news sources purpose of the study the purpose of this study therefore is to provide a brief overview of mass media news theory that may be of use for bi librarians as background material when they create instructional exercises dealing with
 the library quarterly the popular press i also provide a short example of a possible teaching strategy that could be used to illustrate these theoretical concepts the methodological approach adopted in this article takes as its starting point the work ofjurgen habermas on the public sphere in the structural transformation of the public sphere habermas argued that in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries in europe there existed a true if limited public sphere centered around coffee houses and salons that encouraged political critiques of the status quo based on reason and sound argumentation this dialogue defined as the pursuit of truth through an intersubjective dimension was compromised however by the emergence of monopoly capitalism represented by the commercialization of the press in which specialized journalists who were governed by the private interests of the proprietor replaced rational public discourse  pp   in addition habermas suggests that because capitalism was very good at framing all issues as essentially technical or strategic questions questions of the most effective means by which a given end can be attained society as a whole was unable to address those issues that had to do not with means but with ends and standards of conduct  p  in effect capitalism portrayed itself as the normative social system and its dominance was achieved unconsciously through what louis althusser labeled the concrete social processes embodied in the ideological state apparatus family school church and media  p  these processes by definition are ubiquitous and therefore vastly influential in the lives of individuals this article thus privileges what denis mcquail identifies as the dominance mediation model of mass communication in which an elite class has a concentrated ownership stake in a standardized routinized and controlled media whose selective content is decided from above and whose main thrust is confirmative of the existing social order  p  i survey the numerous interconnected strands of this theory fully realizing that there is an opposite tradition called the pluralist model  pp   which argues that competing political social and cultural interests and groups are responsible for bringing forth numerous independent media voices that offer competing and diverse views that are responsive to audience demand  p  as  the liberal pluralist model has in the united states been based on policies codified by the american society of newspaper editors asne and the federal communications commission fcc the asne expects its members to serve the general welfare by enabling people to make judgments about issues of the time be independent from vested interests be impartial in the sense of making  clear distinction between news reports and opinion and to practice fair play by having espect for the rights of people involved in the news  and giving opportunities for reply    pp      the fcc imposes
instruction and media news literacy  john b thompson  pp    convincingly demonstrates there is no question that on balance the proliferation of newspapers magazines and electronic broadcast outlets has created new forms of interaction new kinds of visibility and new networks of information diffusion in the modern world because these diverse media allow modern individuals to interact with others and observe persons and events without ever encountering them in the same spatial temporal locale people have not only extended the heretofore circumscribed space time frameworks of their everyday lives but also developed the ability to negotiate between numerous and different space time frameworks in such a way as to relate their mediated experience of other times and places back to the contexts of their ordinary lives one result of this is that news media have helped to create a world in which fields of interaction can become global in scale and the pace of social change can be accelerated by the speed of information flows  pp    a positive aspect of the exponential expansion of media forms is that what were formerly localized struggles to express a viewpoint or complaint have now been universalized and constituted as struggles for visibility within the non localized space of mediated publicness as the civil rights and women movements eloquently bear witness the struggle to make oneself heard or seen    is not a peripheral aspect of the social and political upheavals of the modern world on the contrary it is central to them  pp   to be sure the dominance mediation model is highly critical of the ability of news media organizations to offer an independent and diverse view of world events but it is precisely this quality of skepticism that should make this model attractive to bi librarians after all bi practitioners spend a great deal of time showing students how to evaluate critically such academic sources as scholarly serials monographs subject databases and reference works accordingly it only seems logical that this same critical attitude should be adopted with respect to mass media news sources and it is the dominance mediation model that provides a powerful set of tools for bi librarians to work with as they attempt to find the best ways to teach academic library users about the intricacies of mass media news a likely question at this point would be is it more powerful and useful than the pluralist model i believe that the answer is yes and on its licensees the obligation to make iligent positive and continuing efforts to discover and fulfil the tastes needs and desires of the service area through particular attention to maintaining balance between various interest groups in respect of some controversial policy issue and to ensturing heterogeneity and diversity  pp   
 the library quarterly for the following two reasons first the overwhelming amount of information presented daily to the public has according to theorists such as guy debord and jean baudrillard made that information into a series of commodified images and representations that are mere simulations because they are divorced from their social context in short these images have become thinglike spectacles to be consumed as if they were any other object as nick stevenson observes the problem is that the spectacle gives human misery and suffering the appearance of unreality the proliferation of images becomes a wall of enforced distraction so that the individual becomes deep frozen beneath the cacophony of information flows  pp    thus those very aspects of the liberal pluralist model diversity and a lack of bias that potentially make it a motor for social change also create the conditions for passive consumption of undifferentiated informational representations second the dominance mediation model broadly speaking holds that the media have powerful effects on those consuming it so much so that fundamental challenges to existing social structures are frustrated and marginalized the pluralist tradition subscribes to an active audience approach which states that mass media have minimal effects on people that individuals are able to pick and choose what they want from the mass media especially television and that moreover they make use of numerous private strategies which allow them to construct their own interpretation of events   in this approach the media no longer monolithic as a result of the proliferation of electronic and print choices have only a limited effect because heterogeneous members of the audience actively engage with media images negotiating independent meanings based on their own unique experiences  another criticism of the dominance mediation model is that it has been superseded by recent developments in electronic technologies such as the internet on this reading the increased channel capacity whether through television or web sites has led to audience fragmentation this situation is termed the new media environment in which unlimited channels of communication offer content on a timetable of the individual choosing the concept of a mass audience that can be simultaneously targeted and influenced thus disappears however as james webster and patricia phalen point out it has been erroneously assumed that the creation of a mass audience presupposed simultaneous delivery of media content but this temporal restriction is not necessary since advertisers for example spend a great deal of time trying to reconstitute the fragmented groups into a mass commodity by aggregating it across time  pp      in a certain sense this line of thinking is an outgrowth of paul lazarsfeld work in the s and s in which he argued that americans paid little attention to mass media that most information originally broadcast by mass media is received through one or more layers of opinion leaders by word of mouth messages and that these messages are more or less accepted or discarded on the basis of the prior belief systems of the people receiving
instruction and media news literacy  while this may be true for specific cultural products viewed or read in a delimited time and space proponents of the active audience approach neglect the effect of what lai si tsui terms the combination of various cultural means in the existing totalizing information cultural environment  p  in addition the emphasis on the ability of the individual to negotiate meaning when confronted with mass media does not take into account the fact that negotiation takes places between parties who are aware that negotiations are occurring and of what at stake  p  it also does not take into account the sheer size and corporate ownership structure of the news and information media factors that skew any attempt at a balance of power as william seaman argues unless people are genuinely aware of the sorts of information perspectives analyses beliefs and images that are systematically filtered out of the mainstream media it is simply wrong to suggest that they are truly free in their decisions to act and to negotiate meanings insofar as they have been manipulated by a system of causal constraints they must at least have some knowledge of the assumptions undergirding that system of exclusion and inclusion in order to orient themselves in it and to undertake negotiations from an equal position of power  p  if bi is to teach as oberman recommends the politics of information  p  then it is important to understand the broad sociopolitical context in which mass media news operates and how this context affects content the dominance mediation model is particularly good at describing the connections and hidden relationships that form this sociopolitical context and that ultimately form a combinatory and totalizing information environment it has the advantage of creating in the individual reader or viewer an interlocutory perspective that is the necessary precursor to any act of negotiation in other words since the mass media news apparatus has an enormous advantage in the struggle over meaning because of its very ubiquity  p  knowledge of some of the directions and thinking prevalent in dominance mediation research may allow the individual student first to realize that a process of negotiation ought to take place when she reads or views mass media and second to be able to undertake that negotiation armed with a the messages it has been pointed out however that a hidden political agenda was behind lazarsfeld development of minimal effects theory namely it served to legitimize amefican democracy in the immediate postwar years not only were the media not very influential it was found too that opinion leaders were not necessarily the wealthy and the powerful high status members of society different people were the leaders of opinion in different areas of choice power was in no way concentrated in the hands of any particular group or elite the pluralist idea of power dispersed across the population was apparently verified from d barrat media sociology quoted in  pp

instruction and media news literacy  serve to perpetuate the stereotype of benign and paternal colonial powers having to ride to the rescue of floundering and violence prone african states ultimately there is no attempt in this article to link the violence to the past actions of western political and corporate powers in the second new york times article in africa there more than one great dictator october    the endemic corruption besetting certain african countries especially congo brazzaville is put in the spotlight while there is an explicit acknowledgment that outsiders such as elf aquitaine played an important role in congo brazzaville by helping keep friendly autocrats financially satisfied so as to maintain its hold on one of the world richest petroleum zones and while there is brief mention of other american and german firms who play similar games the focus remains squarely on detailed accounts of the lavish and opulent lifestyles of numerous african leaders p  the reader is meant to see that the problem of corruption is a widespread one and despite the allusive headline of the article to associate that corruption with a long list of self indulgent african presidents the article ends with a consideration of how such corruption can be forestalled the significant point to note here is that all the solutions assume that it is africans themselves and their faulty institutions that are to blame for the corruption and given this fact that it is only right that the preponderant burden for change should fall on them the world bank the article points out wants to cut off development funds to corrupt countries and has already adopted this approach with kenya another expert robert e klitgaard the author of a book called tropical gangsters  states that a fundamental transformation of african systems is needed so as to eliminate situations where a person or presumably a state itself has monopoly power over a good or service and thus has discretionary power over whether you get it p  once this monopoly power no longer exists corruption it is implied will also disappear for all intents and puirposes the second times article blames the victims for any lifficulties that befall them firms such as elf remain abstract entities that are somehow involved in the corruption though the extent of their involvement is never concretely delineated accordingly nowhere is it suggested that structural and profit driven economic interests such as those represented by elf aquitaine should be held accountable for the problems they have caused in various african countries rather these countries should be made to conform to western economic development patterns more important it is never assumed that the structural economic interests that elf aquitaine represents should be forced to change
 the library quarterly alternative readings of the congo brazzaville situation are available and it is here that the role of the bi librarian becomes crucial students should be encouraged to search for such alternative readings and interpretations and should be provided with lists of possible publications to examine in the case of congo brazzaville good sources of alternative views are french language newspapers and magazines contained for instance in the presse subfile of the europe library on lexisnexis i want to refer briefly to three such articles sassou nguesso in pointe noire victory for oil agence france presse october   congoangola la pax petroliere lvenement october   and le jeu ambigu dlf au congo le monde october     taken as a group these articles provide much detail about the extensive intricate machinations of oil companies in central african countries as well as the geoeconomic considerations undergirding their actions the article titles alone indicate the central place that oil economics played in the civil war moreover the use of the word jeu in le monde suggests that elf relationship with african countries displays the characteristics of the great game that nineteenth century imperial powers played with their colonies congo brazzaville is presented not just as being under the influence of elf but rather as a pawn in a high stakes battle among elf chevron exxon shell total and occidental petroleum for the vast oil fields along the angola congo border in areas known as cabinda and pointe noire thus both the united states and france are portrayed as manipulating political outcomes on the basis of their economic and energy interests in an area of the world whose oil reserves rival those of the caspian sea the overall take no prisoners strategy impitoyable politique of these companies is described in terms of always having two irons in the fire dvoir toujours deuxfers aufeu as they compete for exploration permits and project financing a strategy that cannot but destabilize national interests congo brazzaville has in effect become their private preserve so much so that oil receipts make up  percent of its state resources everybody has paid everybody else the merciless world of the oil firms knows no limits states the agence france presse report  elfs role in the congo brazzaville war is presented at length meetings between high level company officials and political leaders are recounted to an extent that leaves little doubt that elf in a very real sense micromanaged the war elf executives are depicted as making flying visits to key locations giving orders and then leaving to arrange affairs in nearby gabon in sum the three english language articles recount a very different world than the three french language reports for the first group of
instruction and media news literacy  articles the war is but one more example of a long line of personal power struggles between african leaders whether within or across national borders certainly western corporate involvement is broached but only to denounce the rampant and flamboyant corruption of african political leaders indeed african corruption is painted as being much worse than asian corruption since in asia profits from corruption tend to be invested in productive activities while in africa the capital is consumed wastefully or banked overseas  p  the responsibility of western multinationals is therefore elided and the fault is placed squarely on stereotyped african dictators in a very real sense the reporting of events in the economist and the nev york times is filtered through a news frame characterized by a neocolonialist discourse and rhetoric that perpetuate what shoemaker and reese call systematically asymmetrical power relations  p  ella shohat and robert stam moreover argue that such rhetoric is complicit in entrenching a hierarchical global system in which first world countries together with multinational corporations simultaneously generate both the wealth of the first world and the poverty of the third world   pp   in other words these sources have in entman formulation selected some aspects of a perceived reality and made them more salient in order to promote a particular definition or moral evaluation  p  in the french language reports on the other hand the emphasis is clearly on western corporate responsibility for the civil unrest in congo brazzaville the news frame here is constructed so as to stress the frenzied activities of multinationals caught in the gearworks of implacable market forces the reader is brought to the realization that the real culprit in the civil war is an economic system predicated almost exclusively on extracting profits no matter the cost to the well being of host countries conclusion hegemony and the news adherents of the hegemonic approach have been criticized for being static economic determinists insofar as they argue that culture is a reflection of the economic base and perceive that all aspects of life  any interpretation such as the foregoing should be accompanied by a series of cautionary words such as those offered by christopher campbell the news like other cultural artifacts lends itself to multiple interpretations but i would welcome those interpretations that are different from mine as an ongoing discussion of how the news contributes to and generates myths  and how it constructs eality   p 
 the library quarterly under capitalism are a mirror reflection of the systemic need of capitalism  p  these critics point to the changing face of the postindustrial service economy as evidence that the relations evident in industrial capitalism are no longer applicable however as herbert schiller  p  reminds us the fundamental dynamics and underlying mechanisms of the economic order remain even though capitalism itself has undergone many changes and is beset by numerous contradictions more than an economic system capitalism schiller contends is an evolving social formation subject to an intricate play of relations of domination and subordination which can take different forms in different historical periods indeed as gitlin writes hegemonic ideology can only flourish by absorbing and domesticating conflicting values definitions of reality and demands on it  p  thus while the dominant frames of hegemony alter as historical processes unfold the superstructure is constant schiller ideas thus dovetail neatly with gramsci preoccupation with a total social authority that is able imperceptibly and incrementally to win the consent of the governed to its assumptions and priorities one agent of this struggle for consent is the mass news media which is socialized to privilege corporate and elite interests and to exert ideological domination  this article presents a large body of scholarship whose cumulative thrust suggests that what has generally been thought of as objective news reporting by mainstream media outlets is rather agenda driven by corporate and governmental entities the theoretical framework offered by the dominance mediation model of research in conjunction with the insights into media source distribution management policies financial imperatives and work routines provides a powerful lens through which to approach critically television and mainstream print publications  what makes the news what is considered to be important in the news and how the news is presented may be seen as socially constructed perceptions of reality very often replicating the concerns of an elite class intent on camouflaging andor furthering structural inequities the hope of course is that bibliographic instruction librarians will make use of some of these theories in their teaching duties before decoding of media news messages is possible students need to understand what goes into the message that is the sum total of what is encoded in it as stuart hall  p  argues the encoded meaning structure of media communication discourse should be seen against the background of the technical infrastructure and the relations of production that allow it to be broadcast or printed these relations of production in turn give rise to certain frameworks of knowl
instruction and media news literacy  edge only at this point then is the communicated discourse or message complete accordingly trying to understand a media news message without this background knowledge results in an incomplete and passive decoding of its content for hall this is at best circumscribed decoding since it amounts to accepting dominant definitions  and grand totalizations to taking for granted the inevitability and naturalness of the social order a richer decoding approach however is one which has some awareness of the sociopolitical and socioeconomic context of media production and thus is able to create a negotiated or oppositional position to its content by retotalizing the message within some alternative framework of reference  pp   this then should be one of the key instructional objectives for bi to move from a passive decoding of media content to a negotiated decoding bibliographic instruction librarians are keenly interested in teaching students how to orient themselves with respect to diverse scholarly and reference sources and how to evaluate their contents after all university and college libraries contain an untold wealth of such sources but since most academic libraries also have extensive collections of newspapers and magazines as well as access to a number of massive news and information databases such as lexisnexis orientation strategies and practical exercises that deal specifically with popular news and magazine sources and that provide students with the tools to make critical negotiated and even oppositional evaluations of their contents should not be overlooked references  martin lynne m ed library instruction revisited bibliographic instruction comes of age new york haworth   edwards sherri bibliographic instruction research an analysis of thejournal literature from  to  research strategies  spring     association of college  research libraries bibliographic instruction task force on statements of objectives model statement of objectives for academic bibliographic instruction draft version college  research libraries news  may     oberman cerise avoiding the cereal syndrome or critical thinking in the electronic environment library trends  winter     oberman cerise unmaskinig technology a prelude to teaching research strategies  winter     hubbard taylor bibliographical instruction and postmodern pedagogy library trends  fall     nahl jakobovits diane andjakobovits leon a bibliographic instructional design for information literacy integrating affective and cognitive objectives research strategies i i spring
