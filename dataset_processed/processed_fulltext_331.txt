 the library quarterly information library provides an exhibit collection of selected materials for inspection with trained american librarians to consult and advise  p  williams vision that the owi libraries could contribute to the winning of the peace by giving the commonwealth public access to american expertise in american books was fired by the monthly reports from the outposts in australia new zealand and south africa these countries with their small populations and traditional ties to england had never represented particularly attractive targets for us publishers their english language titles had always been almost exclusively british imprints when american books were made available through the owi libraries the currency of the material and the attractiveness of their formats excited a demand for american publications which commercial sources could not satisfy the reports from the melbourne and sydney owi libraries record constant queries about where users might buy the books exhibited or how to subscribe to journals displayed from south africa came reports of booksellers seeking help in the difficult ordering of just seen american materials and librarians and educators who having been exposed to new professional tools in the owi libraries sought help in acquiring them organized us reaction to the clamor for american books came in several stages in  owi headquarters in washington began to send special collections to the outposts for loan or exhibit typical of these was a library of congress selection of american scientific texts and journals forwarded to the owi libraries for display at commonwealth professional conventions american commercial publishers many of whom saw a positive duty to satisfy a hunger for books  p  were not far behind immediately after victory in the pacific the american book publishers bureau dispatched edward hamilton and whitney darrow to make an on the scene survey of the book markets of australia and new zealand areas which although sparsely populated were already known to have an extraordinarily high per capita consumption of books  p  in october  hamilton and darrow reported that american publishers could double their sales to australasia overnight if there were stock available not only were us titles more up to date than the british but even if the same title was available in both english and us imprints and shelved adjacently the customer would buy the more attractive american book stringent paper rationing in england during and after the war necessitated the closer setting of type and the use of thinner paper it was not until  that paper became reasonably plentiful in europe the darrow report concluded that the main obstacle to us penetration of this huge market australasia represented  percent of british empire sales lay with traditional trade agreements
information for the allies  whereby american publishers did not sell directly to the commonwealth but sold the commonwealth rights to english publishers as part of the entire british empire package before any concerted attack could be made on these long established distribution methods british publishers sensitive to the threat posed by american imprints in traditional british markets formulated what came to be known as the british marketing agreement the agreement which was in effect until  formalized the old book trade conventions and in effect legally closed the commonwealth except canada to most usproduced books its effects were at least as frustrating to commonwealth bookmen and scholars as they were to thwarted american publishers the only books of american origin available for sale in the commonwealth were those to which english publishers had decided to buy the rights the titles might be quite irrelevant for readers in say south africa or new zealand moreover there were some titles which english publishers would buy and then decide not to publish and others which they might publish at home but not export to the commonwealth these titles were effectively lost to the commonwealth book trade with which american publishers could not deal directly for fear of jeopardizing their position in the competition for lucrative british rights commonwealth booksellers who read publishers weekly and the book supplements of the new york times and herald tribune were painfully aware of what they were missing the obstruction of the free importing of american books into the commonwealth was made even more effective by the postwar dollar shortage which dimmed all hopes of sterling block countries buying american materials in any quantity restrictions imposed throughout the sterling area on dollar purchases cut book imports to the bone just as many scientists scholars and technicians in those areas were desperately trying to make up for all the time lost during the war the darrow report recorded sadly that in  australia was to be permitted only  percent of its  dollar expenditures for us printed materials  p  postwar inflation as well as america importance as a producer of published research at that time made such a quota pitiful indeed closing owi libraries in the british commonwealth given the difficulty of buying american books commercially the discouragement of us information library patrons was especially keen when injuly  the closing was announced of the american libraries in the british commonwealth in an effort to cool an inflationary economy by cutting back programs originally designed as wartime measures
 the library quarterly congress mandated an almost  percent budget cut  vs  for the office of international information and cultural affairs within which the former owi libraries operated in  in the subsequent reorganization of the office by assistant secretary of state for public affairs william benton cold war strategy was clear untouched and sometimes augmented were activities in problem areas such as turkey the near east and africa but gone were information services to the friendly commonwealth lands  the local protests against the closures were strong and indicated no little sense of anger even desperation some commonwealth academics feared professional isolation luther evans remembered an australian economist who told him that his own personal studies would have been utterly impossible without the collection of the american library in melbourne  p  helen wessells was told by several melburnians that she could not leave that it was like turning out a light her final report dated july   contains excerpts from dozens of protest letters written by mayors librarians and businessmen all expressing disbelief that the united states would terminate a service so mutually beneficial  similar reactions were recorded in cape town and sent on to washington by winifred linderman in view of the subsequent history of south africa one journalist letter is particularly poignant does ashington fully realize what such a library means in a town like ours where strangely enough much prejudice is still alive against everything american the americans themselves cannot be aware of this prejudice since it is of course not shown to them personally   i really hate to see the library closed not only because it was valuable to me in my profession as a trade journalist but because i feel that in south africa with her growing isolationist tendency institutions of this kind are much needed  despite the protests of readers as well as librarians the books were packed up and the buildings closed through the exertions of influential local citizens and officials not the state department homes were found for the collections in the public library of victoria the public library of new south wales and in the university of cape town library helen wessells and winifred linderman came home in  and mary parsons in  after she had spent a year working for the government of new zealand on the establishment of the library school in wellington while the budget cuts of  represented only a temporary reversal in the growth of the united states information service they presaged significant changes in information policy resulting from the cold war after energetic lobbying by benton and some congressmen who were concerned about distorted perceptions of america abroad the smithmundt act was passed in  permitting the reopening within the next few years of many overseas libraries with a mandate similar to that of the old owi facilities namely to give full and fair information to promote
