  the library quarterly grimes et al  while libraries may offer many different types of childrens programs across the nation storytimes are the one program that can be consistently found in most libraries currently libraries are promoting their storytimes as programs that support the early literacy skills of children as well as helping to provide other school readiness experiences storytime providers are designing storytimes that contain a multitude of activities including books songs finger plays crafts group activities and playtime these activities help to support various types of learning while still being developmentally appropriate albright et al  and maintaining the fun enjoyable qualities crucial to informal learning environments ghoting and martin diaz  because storytimes are designed by the storytime providers to meet their specific communities needs their format and contents can be very diverse from library to library due to this diversity libraries lack a broader understanding of how to identify and measure the actual early literacy outcomes they believe are occurring in storytimes storytimes and other library programs for young children have been left largely undocumented because empirical research of library services for young children is uncommon there seems to be a general agreement that these programs are valuable without a precise understanding of their outcomes experiences in these programs are likely to allow children to learn and practice emerging early literacy skills celano and neuman  however additional evidence based research is still needed to assert the library as a meaningful early literacy partner library systems in washington state are among the practitioners and information policymakers nationwide struggling to find accurate and meaningful ways to measure the impact these programs are having on children one recurring theme centers on finding ways to measure whether an early literacy focus of library storytimes has an impact on childrens early literacy skills this need serves as a basis for the study described here which endeavored to answer the overall research question does the early literacy focus of public library storytimes make a difference in the early literacy skills of the children who attend literature review the national early literacy movement and libraries reading is now widely accepted as an emerging process originating in early childhood lonigan burgess and anthony  literature within this interdisciplinary area is retrieved through a couple of keywords for example emergent literacy and early literacy there are distinctions in these terms however for the purpose of this article the term early literacy will be used to collapse both terms the increased focus on early literacy outcomes stems partly from research that indicates that major disparities in literacy and language abilities at kindergarten entry  jacobsonchernoff et al  murray and harrison  generally persist into the elementary school grades children who develop strong reading skills continue to become better readers while children with poor skills continue to fall behind stanovich  a phenomenon often referred to as the matthew effects in reading betty hart and todd r risley  found that at age  children from families on welfare had smaller vocabularies than those from
early literacy in library storytimes   professional families and for those same children the differences in vocabularies at age  were closely related to differences in child outcomes at age  the national early literacy panel nelp reviewed empirical early literacy research to discover the factors that support early literacy development nelp identified alphabetic knowledge knowing the letters of the alphabet phonological awareness sensitivity to sounds and name writing to be among variables that were consistently and moderately to strongly predictive of later conventional literacy outcomes nelp  regardless of their emphasis on early literacyfocused programs libraries were left out of the nelp report because of the lack of empirical research examining the early literacy outcomes of their programs while researchers have gained ground in understanding some of the foundational factors that impact long term literacy development the combination of these factors for literacy success is still not well defined the nelp report emphasizes letter and sound knowledge in early literacy skills but according to william h teale jessica l hoffman and kathleen a paciga  this emphasis cannot be taken as justification to focus solely on these skills and neglect other crucial skills such as comprehension oral language and vocabulary which also contribute to literacy achievement libraries have long recognized the need to emphasize a wide range of early literacy skills in order to have a strong impact on childrens early literacy outcomes in  the public library association pla and the association for library services to children partnered with the national institute of child health and human development to develop a joint early literacy project called every child ready to read ecrr as a way to begin to address these early literacy needs for libraries and the parents and other caregivers that they serve ecrr a research based parent caregiver program model developed by early literacy experts grover whitehurst and christopher lonigan meyers and henderson  became a foundational early literacy training framework emphasizing six early literacy skills print awareness letter knowledge phonological awareness vocabulary narrative skills and print motivation in  susan neuman and donna celano were commissioned by the american library association and pla to evaluate ecrr neuman and celano  which led to the second edition ecrr ecrr shifted the presentation of the six early literacy skills from ecrr to a framework of five practices singing talking reading writing and playing and six early literacy components oral language vocabulary background knowledge print conventionsawareness letter knowledge and phonological awareness regardless of the emphasis on early literacy training with ecrr and ecrr there have been very few experimental or quasi experimental studies conducted on the impact that library connections have on childrens early literacy development although qualitative early literacy studies have been conducted within libraries mckechnie  becker  many activities and methods for including early literacy in library programs are still informed by studies conducted outside libraries stooke and mckenzie  for example previous research has identified home literacy related activities for young children that help promote
  the library quarterly childrens reading and writing development evans shaw and bell  senechal  phillips and lonigan  some of these research based home literacy related activities transfer well into informal learning environments additional research design considerations not commonly associated with formal learning environment research make it difficult to apply an experimental research lens to the informal learning environment of libraries libraries may market a storytime for preschoolers however unlike a formal classroom setting in which childrens ages are clearly defined or controlled library programs may include younger or older children in addition to the variability in ages inconsistencies in group size individual attendance and the fact that the children may visit the library with someone other than their primary caregiver are all factors that complicate data collection and analysis public library storytimes do not follow a prescribed curriculum as do more formal school environments teacher certification is regulated by the state however public librarians may work within early literacy environments without certification or any formal early childhood education or prior knowledge of the discipline despite the additional complexities in designing informal learning environment studies research investigating the important role of public libraries in childrens literacy development is expanding celano and neuman  campana and dresang  the study valuable initiatives in early learning that work successfully views was designed in response to the need for ways to measure the effectiveness of public library early literacy programs for young children  months the overall research question guiding the study sought to discover whether the early literacy focus of public library storytimes makes a difference in the early literacy skills of children who attend storytime this research supported in part by the institute of museum and library services imls was developed with the early learning public library partnership elplp a partnership of  library systems across the state of washington that is vested in participating in the advancement of early learning the washington state library and thrive washington this article will present the methodology and findings from the first year of the views grant which established a baseline picture of the early literacy content that storytime providers are including in their storytime programs as well as the early literacy behaviors that children are demonstrating while attending these programs these research questions guided the first year  what types of early literacy content are storytime providers incorporating into public library storytimes  what types of early literacy behaviors are children demonstrating when attending public library storytimes
early literacy in library storytimes    how can we evaluate early literacy outcomes in public library storytimes for children the  year study used a mixed method quasi experimental design to achieve the goal of providing objective evidence that library storytimes are making a difference in childrens early literacy skills participants in order to represent a wide variety of public libraries the participants for the study were selected from across the state of washington fig  libraries were selected to participate using stratified sampling from more than  public libraries that belong to the elplp researchers sent a confidential invitation to all elplp storytime providers who offered childrens storytimes on a regular basis requesting volunteers to participate in the study the libraries that the volunteers represented were classified into three strata based on the total number of registered borrowers in their library systems small  registered borrowers medium  registered borrowers and large  registered borrowers thirteen libraries were randomly selected from each of the large and medium groups of libraries and  were randomly selected from the small group for a total of  libraries from the storytime providers who volunteered to participate one provider was randomly selected from each of the  libraries thus  storytime providers from each of the large and medium groups of libraries and  from the small group made up a total participant group of  storytime providers these  storytime providers completed a survey to providing information about their education work history and training of the  storytime providers  had a bachelors degree  had a high school diploma and  had a masters in library science six of the  storytime providers had been working as a childrens storytime provider for less than  years  had been a childrens storytime provider for  years and  had been a childrens storytime provider for more than  years eighteen storytime providers had completed ecrr training  had received ecrr training  had completed both ecrr and ecrr training and  had not received any of the ecrr trainings all of the storytime providers said that they use early literacy strategies in storytime the sample of children in the study was made up of the children who attended the storytime all children within the age range targeted by the storytime were included in the storytime observation researchers did not collect any demographic or identifying information about the children at the storytime observations across the  storytime observations in the first year researchers observed an approximate total of  children  as this article focuses of the first year of the research the quasi experimental portion of the study will be presented in a subsequent article  the strata categories were derived from the washington state librarys size classifications

early literacy in library storytimes   measures to address the overall research questiondoes the early literacy focus of public library storytimes make a difference in childrens early literacy skillsthe study needed to employ valid and reliable observation tools that would help capture the early literacy content of storytimes to achieve this the study utilized two tools whose purposes and design are situated in research and literature benchmarks curricular planning and assessment framework bcpaf and program evaluation tool pet these tools were designed to enable data collection in group settings where participants may differ from week to week dresang  bcpaf was designed to examine the early learning that is occurring within informal learning environments feldman  it builds on washington states early learning and development benchmarks kagan et al  as a framing rubric for an assessment approach that uses behaviors or indicators to understand the learning that is occurring in groups of children age birth to  years attending programs in informal learning environments bcpaf was used during the storytime observations to observe the childrens behavior at a group level as bcpaf is a group level analysis tool it does not provide for data collection that tracks individual children while bcpaf covers five different child development domains only the language literacy and communication domain was used for this study this was done for two reasons  though public library storytimes typically work to support learning across multiple domains of child development in order to manage the scope of the study the emphasis was placed on early literacy  through storytimes storytime providers offer a valuable introduction to literacy and preliteracy skills for children during the critical first  years of life yet they have not had the tools or the evidence that would enable them to advocate for their role as leaders in literacy development for young children the bcpaf observation tool also informed the development of the second research tool used in the study pet the views researchers created pet to mirror the language literacy and communication portion of bcpaf the tools pet and bcpaf have similar formats and pet was designed to complement bcpaf intended to examine the practitioner contribution to early literacy content in programs in informal learning environments pet was used in this study to observe early literacy indicators demonstrated by the storytime provider leading the storytime program pet and the language literacy and communication domain in bcpaf are organized into three age ranges birth to  months  to  months and  to  months within the three  both tools were developed and tested by the researchers

early literacy in library storytimes   pletion of a two quarter research in action course evans et al  the course was intended to provide students with both a foundation in research methods and authentic practice evans et al  using bcpaf and pet student researchers were trained to objectively observe programs take field notes on live observations and practice coding by attending storytimes at libraries not participating in the study the student researchers were provided with coding manuals which included rules on coding the various indicators at the end of the first quarter the student researchers had to pass a reliability assessment in order to collect data for the study which began the following quarter and to receive credit for the course percent agreement was used to analyze the students reliability they were required to score above  agreement with the video keys to be considered reliable using percent agreement the students in the first year had an average of  intercoder reliability on bcpaf and  on pet once the students completed the course and the reliability assessment they were sent to collect storytime observation data at participating libraries data collection prior to the study the storytimes across the state were found to be very diverse having different lengths and different types of activities therefore it was necessary to establish a general uniformity to the storytime observations in advance for the purposes of this study storytimes were defined as beginning with an introduction to the programwhether it be the opening song or the storytime providers introduction the observation continued for no more than  minutes following the introduction and was not to include any playtime or crafting activities a team of  researchers including student researchers and the core research team observed  storytimes in each of the  libraries for a total of  storytimes in the first year three storytimes were observed at each library to mitigate the dynamic nature of informal learning environments each researcher was assigned to a library so that the same researcher coded all three storytimes at the assigned library the observations were completed in the period from march to may the researcher worked with the storytime provider to schedule the three observations during the  month period the storytimes were divided into four categories by the targeted audience of the program birth to  months baby storytimes  months to  months toddler storytimes  months to  months preschool storytimes and birth to  months family storytimes of the  storytime providers  offered baby storytimes  offered toddler storytimes  offered preschool storytimes and  offered family storytimes the core research team designed procedural manuals to standardize the data collection process across multiple data collections and data collectors at each observation the assigned  many of the baby storytimes were only  minutes in length
  the library quarterly researcher informed parents and caregivers of the presence of video cameras the goals of the research and the aggregate nature of the data collection and to assure them that the research met the university of washingtons standards for confidentiality the researcher conducted group level observations of the children attending each storytime in real time and took qualitative field notes the researcher continuously scanned the room to ensure that all the children were observed while the researcher was performing the live observation two video cameras were also used to record each observationone was videoing the children and the other was videoing the storytime provider the video camera recording the children was set up to capture the maximum number of children in its field in order to limit the observations to the age ranges targeted by the storytime researchers were instructed to code only behaviors that were exhibited by children who fell within the target age range since specific demographic information that might enable quick age identification was not collected modules on child development were included in the research course to equip the researchers with the ability to assess age based on visual inspection using only the childs speech behavior and size if uncertain about the age of a child researchers were instructed to age the child up to the next level following the observation the content of the storytime program was coded once with pet using field notes taken from the video of the storytime provider presenting the storytime the childrens behaviors were coded twice using bcpaf one coding was done from field notes of the live observation of the children and one coding was done using field notes taken from the video of the children attending storytime this redundancy covered the likelihood that environmental scans whether done live or over video are unlikely to capture everything the data included in this article are from the video coding of bcpaf with all coding both bcpaf and pet the researcher took field notes of the observations and then performed quantitative analysis using bcpaf and pet in most cases one coding sheet from both bcpaf and pet which matched the target age of the storytime was used eg b  coding sheet for baby storytime however family or mixed age storytimes required multiple coding sheets one for each age group in attendance these separate coding methods and instances were used to provide a holistic mutually supportive picture of each storytime results the results from bcpaf and pet yielded quantitative profiles of the early literacy content of storytimes and of childrens early literacy behavior in public library storytimes the bcpaf and pet data were analyzed in the same manner using two levels of analysis the goal level  differences between the video coding and the live coding of bcpaf are an area for future analysis  as a result of the multiple coding sheets required for the mixed age storytimes the n for the storytime observations is 
early literacy in library storytimes   and the indicator level the goal level analysis focused on the goals that were met essentially the goals that contained indicators that were coded for during the observations the bcpaf data and pet data for each library were each aggregated across the three observations and then across the  libraries pet and bcpaf were also analyzed together using pearsons r to look for a correlation between the two complementary data sets childrens early literacy behavior at storytime bcpaf examining the bcpaf results by themselves provides insight into the early literacy skills that children are demonstrating in storytime table  shows the percentage of storytimes in which behaviors from each goal were observed the table breaks the storytimes down by age to establish which goals were observed with each age range the bcpaf data help to show that children are demonstrating a wide variety of early literacy behaviors while attending storytime for birth to  month storytimes  of the  bcpaf goals were observed in over  of the storytimes for  to  month storytimes  of the  bcpaf goals were observed in over  of the storytimes for  to  month storytimes  of the  bcpaf goals were observed in over  of the storytimes early literacy content in storytime program pet examining the pet data by themselves provides insight into the early literacy content that storytime providers are incorporating into their storytime programs table  shows the percentage of storytimes in which behaviors demonstrating each goal were observed during the program the table presents storytime data by age to establish which goals were observed with each age range the pet data help to demonstrate that storytime providers are including a wide variety of early literacy skills in their storytime programs for birth to  month storytimes  of the  pet goals were observed in over  of the storytimes for  to  month storytimes  of the  pet goals were observed in over  of the storytimes for  to  month storytimes  of the  pet goals were observed in over  of the storytimes putting it all together overall when looking at bcpaf and pet together the analysis found that there was a relationship between the bcpaf results and pet results this relationship was examined by determining the pearsons r for the overall pet and bcpaf scores the results showed a strong positive relationship between the pet and bcpaf scores r  p   therefore  this was possible because bcpaf and pet were designed to mirror each other in design and format

early literacy in library storytimes   findings that emerged from examining the types of early literacy skills found in storytime content and in the childrens behaviors in storytimes are that while a wide variety of early literacy skills are present a relative lack of writing skills for all ages and alphabetic principle for toddlers and preschool children  months months are present at storytime with alphabetic principle occurring in fewer than  of the toddler and preschool storytimes observed and writing skills occurring in even fewer storytimes these absences raise concerns given that skill with alphabetic principle and name writing along with phonological awareness are some of the stronger predictors of later reading success for children nelp  the relative absence of alphabetic principle and writing skills in storytime may be due to lack of training for the storytime provider group size limited budget for supplies and space characteristics storytime providers even with a masters in library and information science typically lack specific training in child development early literacy and early learning that could expand understanding of how to incorporate and support alphabetic principle and writing skills the group size may also impact the inclusion of both of these skills because with a larger group the storytime provider does not have the time or opportunity to monitor respond or interact with the children on an individual basis limited budget for supplies can curtail the activities a storytime provider can use to encourage alphabetic principle and writing skills as alphabetic principle activities can often require letters or other supplies and writing skills often need craft supplies or other objects that utilize finemotor skills the characteristics of the space where storytimes are held may also hinder the addition of writing skills because without adequate space or surfaces it can be tricky to provide opportunities to allow children to practice the act of writing the bcpaf and pet data also help to answer the final research question guiding the first year of data collection due to the relative lack of research focused on library storytimes the researchers wanted to gain an initial understanding of how early literacy outcomes for children attending public library storytimes could be evaluated given the complexities with participant attendance in programs at informal learning environments it was important to understand how outcomes can be evaluated at the group level instead of focusing on individual children the successful use of bcpaf demonstrates that it can be used to evaluate the early literacy outcomes at the group level for children attending public library storytimes another significant finding from the first year was that these tools could be used successfully for research in an informal learning environment to paint a cohesive picture of programs that have previously been difficult to evaluate because of their dynamic nature with bcpaf and pet  researchers were able to pass reliability assessments on the two tools to reliably code  storytimes in the first year the data that emerged from these  observations help to provide a deeper insight into the nature of early literacy in public library storytimes  the writing skills percentages may appear lower than they actually are due to the fact that craft time and playtime were eliminated from the storytime observations
  the library quarterly as with any study there are limitations with the findings described here while other environments and factors that influence early literacy such as home and other early learning programs were not included in the study they do have some influence on the childrens observable early literacy behaviors therefore possibly influencing the bcpaf findings both the bcpaf and pet findings may also have been constrained by the strict observation criteria by restricting the storytime observations to a  minute period following the introduction some components such as craft time and playtime were left out at some libraries in addition even with the reliability assessment coding manuals and procedure manuals the number of researchers may have contributed to slight differences in coding across libraries finally the informal and diverse nature of the public library and the size and geographic distribution of the libraries included in this study may limit the ability to generalize the results to other settings conclusion this article presents the baseline descriptive findings of the first year of a  year study examining the impact of informal early literacy learning on children in library storytimes the findings show that  storytime providers are incorporating many types of early literacy content into their storytime programs  children are exhibiting many types of early literacy behaviors when attending library storytimes  there was a positive correlation between early literacy content delivered by storytime providers and childrens early literacy behaviors and  the tools used in this study could be used to evaluate the early literacy outcomes of public library storytimes these findings help to set the stage for the quasi experimental study that occurred in the second year of research while still focused on the overall goal of providing objective evidence that library storytimes are making a difference in childrens early literacy skills the second year was guided by the overall research question how if at all can we increase theearly literacy outcomes for young children in public library programs the methodology and findings from the second year will be presented in a subsequent article the implications of the findings from the first year of this study are of critical importance to early literacy development in library storytimes while storytime providers have believed for years that storytimes are important to childrens early literacy development this is the first large scale study that effectively assesses their impact on early literacy in a comprehensive systematic valid and reliable way this study also provides researchers and libraries with a way to further explore and evaluate early learning in storytimes by providing valid and reliable tools as well as a model of how to apply other states early learning frameworks to further understand early learning in public library storytimes
