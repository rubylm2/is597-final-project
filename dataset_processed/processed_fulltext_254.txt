  the library quarterlyanswer some ground must be laid in the form of establishing what we are and are not talking about when we talk about the public and specifically a librarys publica curiously obscure question considering that few things have been more important in the development of modernity warner   a brief review of the concept and its variety and contexts will be useful to this project before proposing a practical definition informed primarily by political theory with this definition in hand we can then turn to the question of a changed public how much and why it has changed and how this change has affected libraries and their responses followed by a brief conclusion what the public is and is not toward a practical definition like many widely used concepts public has a wide variety of definitions and meanings so many that the word threatens to become a metaphor which simply is what it does greene and griffiths   rendering it analytically useless in approaching the policies and practices of an institution such as the library however contingent the result distinctions must be made in the use and meaning of the concept of a public in the interests of intelligibility the first is the oldest classical political thinking posited the res publicaliterally a public thingthat which is uniquely concerned with what is common to the whole community often equated with the political terms commonwealth or commonweal wolin    there is an irreducible kernel of the social to publicness it is something shared a public is different from a community with the connotations of affective bonds and shared history carried by that term and it is not a simple aggregation of individuals gathered randomly like a crowd or a mob or purposefully like an audience there are many publics and when we speak of the public we subsume the variety of publics in the people in general emirbayer and sheller  warner  roessler  buschman and warner  for a public to come into being it must self organize through forms that mediate the intimate theater of stranger relationalitymost often through discourse where we recognize ourselves as addressees but also remember that the message was addressed to indefinite others    our participation in the discourse    in common with strangers is part of what constitutes a public and simultaneously ones place within it warner   a public then consists of more than a mere grouping of individual private persons the neoliberal market view of the simple aggregation of free decisions that individuals make regarding their different and distinct interests makes the private and public    interpenetrable feinberg   and obviates the commonality and coming together of publicness by reifying a specific idea of the private though it has been fashionable in contemporary times to conflate the concepts a market is not a public market response is not a publics feed  john coggon   points to smoking and fox hunting as examples of putatively private decisions that happen in public and affect much more than the individual persons who make those choices
the library in the life of the public  back and conflating the two renders the empirical reality of human cooperation and action in concert up to and including action for the common good conceptually incoherent the broader discourse around the publicprivate distinction is larded with complications and implications that cannot be the focus here but the distinction between public and private institutionsand a baseline commonality between them in the case of librariesis highly relevant to this discussion public institutions are those that receive tax money that is collected and spent for a broad social or community purpose and commonly democratically arrived at eg public schools universities and libraries private institutions are frequently organized around private conscience religion around segregation of the sexes or the races or further by religion and thus not eligible for tax support by law or simply by tradition and wealth such as ivy league universities and the metropolitan museum of art feinberg  ingraham  but when tax support in the form of tax exempt status for private institutions is considered and also the fact that libraries within such institutions are frequently supported by an internal tax eg as part of tuition or fees or by resource centered budgeting the distinction is less sharp the important point is that almost all libraries face a public that has some kind of stake in their actions and upon which their financial support depends we have what a public is not and some fragmentary baselines of the concept to build upon michael warner   argues that a public is formed when people pay attention as a group resulting in a reflexive circulation of discourse extending further it is constituted by open ended flows of communication that enable    formulation of  collective orientations emirbayer and sheller   john dewey   adds to the concept a public consists of all those who are affected by the indirect consequences of transactions to such an extent that it is deemed necessary to have those consequences systematically cared for in other words a public is further constituted by an investment in the consequences of decisions there is a time element to the concept past decisions affect present realities and present decisions will bring future consequences thus the institution attracts attention and discussion of decisions creates a public and a locus of  tensional forces political space duringthrough discussion and issue resolution wolin   it is in this sense that certain institutions schools libraries universitieswhether public or privateare political they are funded in some common manner or marked off as a    market segment because their purposes concern a group of people that can constitute a public that is wider than those who happen to be consumers of those services at a given time the institution exists in the interests of broader goods such as the social and political conditions a democratic society needs for in brief public has been equated with masculinity reason action and in contrast private has been equated with femininity household nurturing all of these are now entangled with the private as privacy rights the individual self and conscience and the sociopolitical claims of women and minorities arendt  roessler  cohen  buschman 
  the library quarterlyits own renewal feinberg   put another way healthy democratic institutions are privileged because they respect and are guided by the goods of deliberation mara   a core element in the creation of a public in other words there is a political inflection to libraries relationship to their publics pulling these strands together the practical definition of a public that addresses a library and vice versa put forward here is that the public a pays attention to the institution b receives communication from the institution c communicates with the institution d communicates among its members about the institution e communicates about present benefits and future consequences of institutional decisions  f  communicates in the context of common support for shared resources and services over time this definition has some affinity with descriptions of eighteenth century publics and their discoursing private persons who critically negate political norms of the state and its monopoly on interpretation to form public opinion that institutionalizes itself with the goal of    rational consensus in the emergence of the public sphere and democracy hohendahl   habermas  warner  mills  any one or all of these particular elements may be fragmentary at a given timefor instance in the level of attention or the receptiveness to communication on either sidebut this practical definition describes the basis of how a public commonly engages its library the library in the life of its public it also describes how a library engages its publics and it is clearly related to larger contexts those larger contexts as will be seen clearly relate to the specific and local in other words this definition is scalable it describes not only a local librarys relationships to its publicsand vice versabut also the framework of for instance american library associations response to publics legislative and broad public discourse about the field and its attempts to influence them it describes the framework an academic library administrator experiences when she receives and acts on feedback from students faculty librarians or upper administrators all publics or a library public so the question is is that how publics engage libraries now what is the library in the life of its given publics at this point in time and has it changed have libraries publics changed and if so from what the argument here is yes the public that engages libraries has changed the library in the life of the public is different than it formerly was but as banal as that point might be it must be the differences from other fields are informative public health tends to define the concept narrowly as that which is the laws business and takes for granted a political systemthus making a large assumption about a fundamental relationship core to public health as well as lis coggon    public relations approach to the concept is instrumental and economic communication process that builds mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and their publics httpwwwprsaorgaboutprsapublicrelationsdefinedvdjbpmyfuo the working definition here is also quite different from that of the public realm and its postmodern performative aspects sennett  warner  as well as the idea of public space for action and creativity the stage upon which communal life unfolds carr et al in leckie and buschman   see also arendt 
the library in the life of the public  immediately followed by a disavowal of some halcyon past there is however a difference between the pieces and the pie no account or theory ever describes its social totality but there is considerable evidence that a broad and liberal as marked by generosity of experimentation political public has existed sean wilentz   describes the public and political support for american institutions to help the young and the fallen public schools benevolent societies rehabilitative prisons reformatories and for the truly unfortunate insane asylums with growing wealth a broad public and a political consensus formed to invest in education with wide interest in the topic during the nineteenth century veysey  it was after all african americans exclusion from this system and the substandard resources of their public schools that brought protest litwack  the broad public that supported the founding of public schools believed that the government should play an active role in assuring the success of the economic and social system spring   there certainly was a normalizing ideology connelly  in all of this but equality democracy and citizenship were once prime educational concerns giroux  like the schools publicly supported libraries grew with a growing capacity to afford them shera  and as with the schools that broad support was predicated upon the idea that a library would strengthen the republic government because a free nation rested on the wisdom of the people lee   again there were strong currents of normalization in these developmentsamericanizing immigrants and other forms of social controlbut whatever the particular reasons for their creation public libraries    enabled readers to make whatever use they wanted of collections which became increasingly broad minded and more accessible dain in buschman   the role of the library in the life of the public then was one of support and expansion of possibilities opportunities education or just plain inexpensive leisure wiegand  put most simply publics chose to build classrooms and libraries instead of other things with taxes and philanthropy veysey  that americans fixed their patriotism    on institutions and particularly    political institutions    inspired by abstractions such as equality democracy liberty commager  xiii is perhaps too broad a statement for us in the twenty first century but it contains enough of the kind of a rough pragmatic resem  eighteenth century britainvalorized as emblematic of the enlightenment the bourgeois public sphere and the development of individual democratic rightsproduced political rhetoric that was intensely personal and vituperative sennett    the american political atmosphere at the time of the revolution the constitution and the bill of rightsa time of supposedly high ideals and rhetoricwas equally intense in its apocalyptic furor wilentz   the lincoln douglas debates addressed a public that laughed and shouted encouragement when lincoln was race baited forcing him into humorous racist disavowals that drew their own approving laughter lincoln   strozier  wilentz   two world wars and the civil rights movement brought out examples of racist and discriminatory discourse and legislation that addressed a large and receptive public goldman  goodwin  cohen   some version of that public may still exist see wiegand  nor is this to dismiss alternative and revisionist perspectives on public education and libraries or society volumes by joel spring  and michael katz  on education and the work of michael harris  wiegand  and myself  on libraries are examples william connelly  is an excellent brief source of a broader social analysis
  the library quarterlyblance to the reality of the publics that then existed that it was successfully translated into political terms hofstadter   there were after all publics to which these policies were meant to respond and to which discourses about them were addressed those publics had a chance to ratify or reject them policies and laws and tax support are one clear way to read back into the nature of the publics they represented but the languageits characteristic goals and assumptionsaddressed to those publics about these institutions is another and it is telling equality citizenship and justice were often at the core of this discourse a democratic society    should seek actively to nurture in the young the emotional and intellectual dispositions which will prompt them to put the welfare of the many above the privileges of the few childs in giroux   these were routine statements from establishment figures and publications and this discourse persisted through president lyndon johnsons war on poverty spring   during roughly this same period and for many of the same reasons publicly supported libraries grew in size and scope and operated on an evolving set of democratic principles in response to their publics as a peoples university the protector of the publics right to information and an active educational force in the community for all classes of people a system    unrivaled in the worldalong with a similar and unparalleled growth in academic libraries lee  harris    how have libraries publics changed there is a broad scholarly consensus that we have lived for some time in a neoliberal age buschman   the vast majority of accounts of neoliberalism are critical but its arguments to aggregate diverse individual preferences into social choices moe   to let people have what they want or to respect their freedom to choose taylor   and to remove the power to coerce    by removing the organization of economic activity from the control of political authority friedman in couldry   were addressed to publics receptive to them in other words for our purposes here this account reverses the typical formula that neoliberalism is done to the public and in acknowledging the contemporary ascendency of these ideas examines the effect of neoliberalized publics on libraries briefly neoliberalism posits a bedrock series of assertions about human nature and thus the best social political and economic arrangements for that nature people are rationally motivated by self interest the market is the best mechanism to channel those interests the states hierarchical and bureaucratic restraints thwart the market andor privilege certain groups or activities state action in the name of the public good is therefore ineffective or does harm therefore the state should be weak in the name of market freedom and choice and ideally itself subject to market discipline in its budgets at the same time the state must ex  to be clear harris  challenged this as a democratic dogma that was always undercut by an elitist leadership bent on social control of immigrants and the poor
