introduction there is the need for diversity research that is substantive and that informs the practice of library management there has been little original research about diversity in library and information services in general and in relation to public libraries in particular the limited original research related to diversity has focused primarily on academic libraries diversity in public libraries has become a critical issue in recent years with less focus and possibly more immediacy than is the case in academic libraries the rapid and dramatic demographic changes in the united states have had an impact on the composition of student populations public libraries particularly those in urban areas where there has been and continues to be a tremendous influx of new immigrants nevertheless are facing the challenge of meeting the needs of these segments of the population including those needs related to developing proficiency in english language skills which create ongoing challenges for librarians and administrators the literature on libraries and diversity focuses largely on the discussion of programs in individual libraries and is rarely informed by the broader diversity literature to a lesser degree private sector research and research on the academic environment have begun to document the relationship between organizational investment in diversity and overall organizational performance and success the research that has been done has indicated the role of leadership in influencing organizational efforts and overall organizational success related to diversity the complex relationship between diversity and organizational success continues to be studied with one area of focus being efforts to more fully define a direct causal relationship between fostering diversity and overall organizational success this research study of diversity programs in large public libraries is intended to document the diversity activities and priorities in a segment of the profession that has been studied very little in this regard while the diversity programs of a small number of individual libraries have been discussed in the literature this study represents a broader more comprehensive analysis related to diversity and public library services in order for public library research to inform and enhance practice thus the research addresses the way in which diversity goals are operationalized in library functions and services literature review leadership diversity and organizational success the bases for diversity efforts in organizations include awareness of the increasingly diverse population as potential clients and potential hires as well as addressing past inequities and current unfairness and eliminating underrepresentation recent research in the study of diversity in the private sector and to a limited extent in the academic environment has highlighted a connection between investment in diversity and overall organizational performance and success  thus according to richard koonce now companies are embracing diversity as a business focus and corporate value embracing diversity isnt just the right thing to do theres a strong business case for it  p  the emerging concept of leadership diversity is based on research involving the relationship between organizational investment in diversity and overall organizational performance and success focusing on two primary considerations the diverse representation among those in leadership roles and decision making among leaders that reflects diversity as a priority this representation of diverse leadership includes the composition of the companys board and senior management among other positions in this regard management researchers have documented the fact that the companies that are the most diverse as measured by factors such as minority employment at all levels spending with minority suppliers and underwriting business that goes to minorityowned investment banks have also been identified as more successful companies overall  pp   in the  fortune magazine article identifying americas best companies for minorities the researchers report rankings that indicate that the companies that pursue diversity outperform the sp   p  sherry kuczynski reports similar results in her research addressing what she has described as a direct link between a companys leadership diversity in particular diverse representation among company leaders and its stock market performance  katie dean has shown similar results in relation to financial indicators of success being linked to having women in leadership roles specifically and greater diversity of perspectives in general  in providing an initial explanation for this relationship between diversity and organizational performance kuczynski notes that diverse leadership suggests that a company has drawn a wide pool of talent up through its ranks and is opening itself up to a variety of different views and ideas  the research indicates that diversityrelated goals diversity programs and initiatives are the norm in many companies as reflected in financial decisions  the relationship between diversity and organizational success is yet quite complex as some organizations have become more diverse there have been shortterm reductions in organizational performance associated with difficulties in building consensus  the research reflects the fact that a broader range of perspectives makes reaching consensus more difficult and organizational performance is hindered as traditional organizational cultures change indeed among the companies that have made substantial efforts in relation to fostering diversity and that have been the most successful companies overall often the prevailing organizational culture had to be dismantled with a more inclusive one in its place  p  in the academic environment the research results have indicated that the colleges that are the most diverse are also the most highly rated based on established rankings of academic and financial performance  in addition many university presidents have articulated the importance of fostering diversity in order to enhance the learning environment   leadership diversity theory leadership theory is based on the study of the ways in which individuals can influence the success of organizations through their efforts and those of others providing an appropriate basis for the consideration of issues of diversity as related to organizational success in relation to leadership diversity leadership theory is applicable with regard to the ways in which organizational leaders exhibit influence in fostering diversity and in contributing to overall organizational success and user satisfaction leadership diversity theory focuses on the diverse organization as represented in articles by geoffrey colvin  dean  and kuczynski  in terms of diverse representation among organizational leaders and boards and among employees as well as spending allocated to minority suppliers the organization is also affected by external factors such as societal demographics and the labor market in the field and the region or country in which the organization operates changes in organizational culture are needed in order to overcome shortterm drops in performance as the level of diversity increases  leadership diversity manifests itself in terms of the enhanced creativity and decision making that result from varied perspectives in addition specialized markets of customers are easier to target and an increasing awareness of and concern among consumers regarding the performance social responsibility and composition of the companies that they patronize thus influences overall organizational performance and success the least welldefined aspect of leadership diversity is the role of organizational leaders in the process of creating a more diverse organization as they are influenced by enhanced performance and the ways in which diversity as an organizational priority is operationalized in the processes of organizational operations and service provision with regard to the roles of managers and leaders john ivancevich and jacqueline gilbert suggest that the improper or underutilization of a diverse workforce is  a managerial and leadership issue  thus leaders must articulate a rationale for diversity efforts in organizations that is compelling for employees who have the responsibility of operationalizing diversity goals and provide an administrative structure guidance and support for developing and implementing diversity programs diversity in libraries the literature related to diversity in libraries has focused to varying degrees on the four issues of staffing collections services and organizational climate  p  the scholarly and professional discussion has documented a number of ways of operationalizing these aspects of diversity within the administrative or committee structures of academic libraries the operationalizing includes the addition of administrative positions or the inclusion of diversityrelated responsibilities in existing positions primarily in human resources similarly the operationalizing might include the formation and staffing of diversity committees within the library as well with regard to staffing for example these administrators or committees undertake recruitmentrelated activities such as providing diversity and affirmative action training for search committees monitoring search committees conducting exit interviews with candidates and reporting in writing to the dean of library services at the conclusion of each search as well as activities such as staff training  pp  the results of winston and li study of chief academic officers addressed the processes used to encourage heads of academic units including library directors to foster diversity the research indicated that such approaches are far more likely to include administrative support and expertise  percent of the institutions as compared with the availability of resources to support diversity efforts  percent  with limited funding for new positions or the inability to use vacant lines for such positions in some libraries the implementation of diversity committees has been the result of institutional requirements that units of a certain size have such a committee  p  a study of research libraries showed that while all of the libraries participating in the study had a unit at the institutional level with responsibility for diversity in recruitment more than  percent also had an individual or committee in the library with such responsibilities for the unit  p  the published research indicates that in small academic libraries no more than  percent have library diversity committees and fewer than  percent employ library diversity or affirmative action officers  p  in such cases it is more likely the case that the parent institution has a college diversity or affirmative action officer  percent of such institutions  p  the assessment of performance related to diversity in libraries has been limited organizational climate surveys in libraries which are typically conducted by experts from other disciplines such as psychology assess issues such as the level of diversity among library staff changes in staff composition and administrative support for diversity these climate surveys are also able to identify undocumented difficulties among staff members of different backgrounds in addition the results of such climate surveys have been shown to serve as the basis for organizational improvements  p  the focus on assessment related to user satisfaction in libraries has been emphasized in relatively comprehensive programs such as the association of research libraries libqual program libqual provides mechanisms for assessing the quality of services provided by library staff the extent to which information services and staff provide assistance in meeting user needs the quality and appropriateness of library resources in various formats and facilities the program however does not assess collections or services related to specific demographic segments of the user population beyond the focus on academic majors age and gender for example  another assessment program emetrics is a data collection tool for the analysis of statistical data on network services and resources  emetrics is used in the study of online usage of collections and services allowing for the analysis of a particular type of data that goes beyond traditional data collection involving the use of physical collections and inperson services although assessment tools such as libqual and emetrics have not been used to evaluate services and collections related to diversity they provide the opportunity for use in the evaluation of the growing number of online diversity programs and resources offered by libraries and library associations such as the american library associations diversity online web site which includes a range of online diversity resources and specific library programs  diversity in public libraries to a large extent the literature on diversity in public libraries has focused on collections and services primarily with discussions of individual library programs designed to foster diversity in libraries such as the san diego public  and denver public  or a focus on service to specific populations such as individual ethnic groups  p  or the homeless  in relation to specific aspects of public library service such as services for children for example the literature deals primarily with the need for collection development that incorporates diversity  p  typically in the form of bibliographies  there is limited discussion of recruitment  as well as minimal discussion of assessment of the librarys diversity climate  or organizational design and collaboration with other agencies  in general the public library literature has included limited discussion of issues of diversity that is reflective of original research or the consideration of theoretical models the literature includes many opinion pieces and practical tips  but is rarely informed by the broader diversity or leadership literature the fortune study and the related research involving the relationship between diversity and organizational success in the private sector and the academic environment provide a worthwhile basis for studying such a relationship in public libraries consistent with the focus on considering the role of leadership and administrative structure in influencing diversity efforts that enhance library services criticisms of diversityrelated programs in libraries have included indications of minimal attempts only undertaken in response to organizational requirements for accountability across units and an overemphasis on celebratory programs that include ethnic foods and interesting speakers  p  thus there is the need for diversityrelated research that focuses on organizational activities and programs that are substantive in nature the purpose of this research is to address the relationship between diversity and organizational success in public libraries considering the case of large successful public libraries the primary focus is to identify diversityrelated activities programs and priorities in urban public libraries in four areas staffing collections services and organizational climate and awareness methodology to gather data for this study survey methodology was used with administration of a questionnaire to the urban libraries council ulc a membership organization of one hundred and fortyfour public libraries in metropolitan areas and the corporations that serve them  the urban libraries council was founded in  and its purpose is to strengthen public libraries as an essential part of urban life by striving to address shared issues grasp new opportunities and conduct research that improves professional practice in public libraries  of the  members sixteen are corporate or associate members such as state libraries thus only the  sustaining contributing and regular library members were identified as appropriate for inclusion in the research study a cover letter which described the survey and requested the participation of the member library directors was sent to the director of the ulc who had agreed to forward the letter to the directors the cover letter provided the url which indicated the secure server where the survey instrument used in the study was being housed the survey instrument used in the study was adapted from one used in an earlier study of liberal arts college libraries by the authors  as the modified version of an instrument used to study research libraries and was designed to address diversity awareness staffing information services and collections the association of research libraries arl conducted a study of academic and research university libraries in   in the study the survey instrument gathered data on staffing including recruitment statistical measures of staff composition and retention and supplemented arl spec kit no  affirmative action policies and practices in arl libraries compiled in  the study was based on data gathered from surveys sent to  arl member libraries of which  were academic libraries in  the authors of this study obtained permission from arl to use the questionnaire for a study of liberal arts college libraries the authors modified the arl questionnaire for the population and expanded it to include an enhanced focus on diversity awareness and library and information services and library collection development and assessment specifically participants were asked about the existence of a library diversity committee and a library or college diversity or affirmative action officer as well as about training for library search committees with regard to diversity issues general approaches to increasing awareness of diversity such as diversity workshops and climate surveys were considered as were staffing issues related to documenting minority representation in staff composition recruitment and retention strategies library services for diverse student populations and assessment and development activities designed to evaluate and diversify collections  p  as is consistent with the documented ways in which diversity has been operationalized in libraries participants were asked about the existence and role of a library diversity committee or affirmative action officer as well as about diversity training for library search committees processes to enhance staff awareness of diversity issues such as workshops on diversity and climate surveys were considered as were staffing issues related to documenting minority representation in staff composition recruitment and retention strategies library services for various segments of the population and assessment and collection development activities designed to evaluate and enhance library collections from the questionnaire used with liberal arts college libraries the questionnaire was modified only to reflect the differences in the user populations and the administrative structures of public libraries see appendix  with regard to library services segments of the user population for which targeted services may have been developed and implemented were changed from minority studentsstudents of color in academic libraries to racialethnic minoritiespeople of color and from students with disabilities to people with disabilities for example with regard to the types of programs offered the list in the  questionnaire included reference assistance computerinformation technology assistance and tutoring services the list was expanded to include english as a second language programs and literacy programs in relation to staffing the study of liberal arts colleges addressed the methods used to determine if the library has been successful in recruitment and retention of members of diverse populations terminology such as comparisons with peer institutions libraries and comparisons with census data remained the same comparisons with other campus units were changed to comparison with other municipal or county departments in total thirtynine institutions responded reflecting an overall rate of return of  percent the rate of return is based on the entire survey population as opposed to a random or stratified sampling as indicated the corporate and state library members were excluded from participation thus the libraries in the survey population are all large urban public libraries based on the guidelines for full membership in the urban libraries council such that the nearly onethird group of respondents are likely representative of the survey population  of the large public libraries that were included it was determined that the request of identifying information such as the state in which the library is located might yield data regarding the geographic distribution of the respondents at the expense of reducing the likelihood of anonymity for the respondents as there are only  such libraries there are few such large libraries in most states in addition the study of the public library directors and other administrative officers regarding diversity programs in terms of staffing collections services and diversity awareness in public libraries has not been addressed previously thus this research fills a substantial gap in the literature data analysis diversity awareness and organizational climate in terms of the issue of diversity awareness and enhancing organizational climate related to diversity the survey respondents addressed the question of whether they have made efforts to increase awareness of diversity issues among library staff more than  percent of the libraries have undertaken such efforts one library has not done so two study participants did not provide a response to this survey item the types of activities that have been undertaken include diversity or cultural sensitivity workshops held in the library  percent and the provision of funding support for attendance at conferencesworkshops related to diversity  percent see table  smaller percentages of the libraries have hired outside consultants to evaluate advise or address issues

study participants were asked whether there are library diversity committees or diversity officers in their organizations in fact  percent of the libraries have library diversity committees as might be expected only  percent have library diversity officers staffing recruitment and retention in relation to the issue of staffing the respondents were asked to indicate whether statistics related to staff composition are compiled for their libraries and if so by whom in total  percent indicated that such statistics are maintained for their organizations in more than half of the libraries  percent

library is affiliated maintains such library data in  percent of the libraries while a diversity or affirmative action committee does so in one library  percent while  percent of the libraries have a library diversity officer none of the respondents noted that this individual has responsibility for maintaining data related to staff composition in fact it is the case that the administrator with

open positions in  percent of the libraries such efforts have been undertaken in relation to professional positions and in  percent of the libraries for support staff positions the respondents were asked to identify which of a number of approaches they have used to attract a diverse pool of applicants for open professionals positions nearly threequarters of the libraries have posted job advertisements in national publications see table  in addition nearly twothirds have done each of the following posted advertisements in minority publications mailed job advertisements to deans andor faculty in library schools or contacted specific minority organizations or institutions with job advertisements or for recommendations of potential candidates other processes include posting position

those with interviewing and hiring responsibilities are trained in diversity issues in all but one of the responding institutions  percent such training is provided in nearly twothirds of the libraries such training is provided by the library personnel diversity or affirmative action officer other sources of training were indicated including a library committee the study participants were asked what data the libraries use to determine whether they have been successful in recruitment and retention of members of diverse populations while more than a third  percent of the libraries do not undertake processes to measure the level of representation a large percentage  percent compare the level of representation with census data see table  nearly  percent undertake comparisons with other

assessment related to collections of resources related to diverse populations eg african american collections asianasian american collections in total  percent of the libraries have undertaken such collection assessment in the related area of collection development the participants were asked whether programs have been implemented to diversify the materials in the library collections in relation to diverse populations in this regard  percent of the libraries have made such efforts to diversify their collections in  percent of the libraries the respondents noted that funding has been secured in order to diversify the collections the sources of such funding have included the redirection of funding from elsewhere within the library budget in nearly  percent of the libraries or grant funding

table  funding to diversify library collections source of funding number of libraries percentage of total redirection of funding from library budget   grant funding   municipality   other   overall evaluation in order to determine the extent to which leadership and administrative structure have had an impact on staffing collections services and organizational climate a number of correlational analyses were undertaken in particular the presence of a diversity committee andor a diversity or affirmative action officer in the library was considered with regard to whether diversityrelated activities have been undertaken the results indicate that there is no statistically significant relationship between the presence of a diversity officer and the presence of a diversity committee in other words the fact that a library has one does not correlate with having the other it is interesting to note that there are only two libraries that have both a library diversity committee and a library diversity or affirmative action officer the presence of a library diversity committee was shown to correlate with differences in terms of a number of diversityrelated activities in the areas of recruitment retention and diversity awareness first the fact that there is a library diversity committee correlates with significant differences in terms of the maintenance of statistics associated with professional and support staff positions in fact all of the libraries that have such a committee maintain such data for professional and support staff positions it should be noted though that for those institutions that do not have such committees  percent maintain such data for professional positions and  percent maintain data for support staff positions as represented by chisquare values of

types of data such as peer institution statistics between libraries with or without diversity committees nonetheless for those libraries with a diversity officer significant differences were noted of the fourteen libraries overall that have no program in place for comparison of minority representation among the library staff all of those institutions are without a library diversity officer thus while  percent of the libraries without a library diversity officer have a program of data comparison in place  percent of those with a library diversity officer have such a program as shown by a chisquare value of  also while  percent of the libraries overall use census data for comparative purposes the most frequently mentioned type of data  percent of the libraries with a diversity officer

differences were noted in relation to a number of circumstances while  percent of the libraries overall have no retention program in place of those with a diversity committee  percent have a retention program for minority librarians a significant difference represented by a chisquare value of  in addition while  percent have offered training for other library staff as a part of their retention efforts  percent of the libraries with diversity committees have offered such training as indicated by a chisquare value of  in addition the presence of a library diversity officer was correlated with a statistically significant difference in the use of salary adjustments as a recruitment strategy while  percent of the libraries with a library diversity officer have used this strategy none of the libraries that do not have a library diversity officer has done so as represented by a chisquare value of  it should be noted that only  percent of the libraries overall have used this strategy thus limited conclusions can be drawn about the significance of this finding with regard to organizational climate the only difference that was noted in relation to enhancing diversity awareness among library staff involved the hiring of outside consultants while  percent of the libraries overall have hired consultants in this area  percent of those with diversity committees have done so as compared with  percent of those without diversity committees with a chisquare value of a value that is approaching significance conclusion and implications leadership diversity relates to the relationship between diversity and organizational success with a particular focus on the role of leaders in fostering diversity and the overall importance of increasing the range of perspectives represented to enhance the quality of decision making and the provision of services to the user population studies such as this one can be important in the comprehensive evaluation of services of any type of library particularly academic or public where the increasing diversity of the user population and the overall focus on organizational performance make diversity an organizational priority the results of the research indicate a number of implications associated with public library services in particular the results address the way in which diversity goals have been operationalized in library functions and services in a segment of the library profession that has been studied very little in this regard the implications reflect the focus on the impact of leadership and administrative structure on staffing collections services and organizational climate the findings of this study indicate that organizational leadership is critically important in evaluating the overall operations of libraries and their services and in fostering and promoting diversity programs in all libraries it should be noted that reflective of an understanding of the expanding diversity of the us population in terms of racial and ethnic minorities and immigrants a relatively large percentage of libraries have provided services for and enhanced collections related to these segments of the population to a large extent the enhancement of collections has taken place with no new funding in terms of diversity awareness and organizational climate the responding organizations have undertaken activities to enhance the level of understanding of and support for diversity issues among librarians and staff and yet the use of outside consultants who may bring objectivity and a broader perspective to specific organizational circumstances has been limited in addition the introduction of library diversity committees has been correlated with a prevalence of diversityrelated programs in a number of areas as is often posited in the profession the research results indicate that there appears to be greater focus on recruitment than on retention of members of underrepresented groups while the results may not be reflective of the programs and activities in public libraries that are smaller less well funded and in less diverse communities the results indicate diversityrelated programs and services in large public libraries further research related to diversity in public libraries is needed in order to document diversityrelated programs and constraints in mediumsized and smaller libraries there is the need for further study of the nature of the relationship between the role of leadership in operationalizing diversity in terms of library administrative structure in the form of administrative positions and committee responsibilities and in diversity programs and initiatives in addition further research should address the effectiveness of ongoing recruitment and retention efforts and the level of user satisfaction associated with library services related to diversity similarly while the assessment tools in place at present address user services and user satisfaction in general there appears to be the opportunity to address diversity as a variable with regard to collections and service provision to segments of the population but also public services staff composition in terms of the impact on user satisfaction
