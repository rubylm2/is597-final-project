the urban library and the adolescent margaret a edwards m orris cohen in introducing a symposium on philosophy which i attended observed that man was getting neither better nor worse but as the individual has his ups and downs with some good days and some not so good so too the human race maintains something of a norm if this is the case is it not as true for teen agers as for the whole race as a group are they basically different from what they always were man activities may fall into new patterns but his conception of the world and the universe will be as new each year as the discoveries of science his habits of worlk and play will be altered by electronics but his concerns will remain constant he will still need love and security he will seek for identity and fulfilment he will still wonder about the meaning of his own and all existence though he may die without realizing it the answers he is seeking are in books it is important that the adolescent learn this since his search for meanings is especially urgent and intense teen agers today represent a larger percentage of the population than ever before television brings them into our living rooms to assauilt our senses and sensibilities screaming and gyrating to outrageous music or milling around in love ins we are so stunned by all this that we often forget to cast a balance and to see it in proper perspective for television also brings us the college bowl as well as panels of brilliant amazingly well balanced high school students we must remember the peace corps and vista and the thousands of young people who help disadvantaged children with their homework and in other ways their peaceful demonstrations no matter which side they take are better than apathy all over the world young people are interested in politics and society welfare but their eagerness to take up causes and protest their readiness to overthrow established order and set right what seems to them wrongs their potential power in sheer numbers all this means they desperately need a sound attitude toward life civilized feelings an understanding of people and culture something to go on besides emotion there are various sources where they may find understanding enrichment and ideas but the most reliable never failing source is the books on the shelves of the public library wnthat is the public library doing to interest adolescents in reading these books in most cases nothing the usual custom is to supply factual material for school assignments when requested but to leave the adolescent strictly on his own when he wants books for pleasure and enrichment this however is not the case in some cities where some provision is made for the teenager and special services are offered to him for years detroit has conducted educational television programs for teen agers philadelphia has worked with delinquents and probationers dallas and seattle have worked effectively 
the urban library and the adolescent  with schools new york city has led the way in work with manual minded vocational students and with a phenomenal radio book discussion program baltimore besides its program with schools has been an innovator with book fairs in service training and at present experimental programs in the war on poverty some other cities have set up special services for young adults and are doing good work but the present social crisis in our big cities calls for a general breakthrough it is extremely important that teen agers all over the nation find out that the public library has a lot more for them than simply material for school assignments because this seems to me so urgent i am going to make five charges against the public library not in a spirit of hostility but with a firm faith in the potential of the library for influencing the thinking and feeling of the adolescent and with the hope of stimulating new courses of action i shall cite as state evidence for my charges the recent survey of metropolitan public library users of the maryland baltimorexvashington metropolitan area by mary lee bundy associate professor of the university of maryland school of library and information services the urban district surveyed is organized supported and well enough patronized to seem to serve as a representative fair and up to date example of the urban library how has the library failed the adolescent  it has failed in the relationship of the majority of its staff to adolescents the ala ad hoc committee on instruction in the use of libraries in its report to the san francisco conference stated one of the greatest blocks to the total use of public libraries has been the attitude of generations of public librarians toward students attitudes of resentment are being perpetuated the bundy survey shows that although adults were not unusually critical of the staff  per cent of the students complained one said i appreciate the librarians who can tell when you need help and offer it to you in a pleasant manner without making you feel ignorant another wrote kindness is a virtue and i hope in the future we will have kinder librarians why do so many librarians seemingly dislike teen agers are they insecure and feel that higher status is achieved through working with adults are they afraid of adolescents is it a little touch of sadism that leads a librarian to humiliate the defenseless young person criticizing him instead of his teacher who made an unfortunate or improper assignment interrogating him in a seemingly polite way that undermines his confidence administrators are aware of this hostility but little is done to inculcate continually in all members of the staff an attitude of outgoing helpfulness that will include even teenagers although adolescents make up about half of a library patronage beyond the children department many librarians still consider them an interruption to business it is not only the  per cent who wrote complaints who resent the staff even those not mistreated resent seeing librarians embarrass their friends yet we wonder why there is  mary lee bundy metropolitan public library users a report of a survey of adult library use in the maryland baltimore washington metropolitan area preliminary reports college park university of maryland school of library and information services  mimeographed

the urban library and the adolescent  formational services and underplay the promotion of reading are dangerously close to this point of view according to the survey cited above the percentage of people who come to the library for general reading is exactly the same as for those who come for materials or information on a subject so our services are geared to the needs of half the patrons we not only fail to make contact with the other half but we do not call recreational reading to their attention in most of our displays we boast of how little fiction we circulate fiction belles lettres and biography depict the human heart and enrich experience they are concerned with sorrow and joy and love they cultivate the mind civilize the emotions and promote understanding yet we take more pride in the circulation of scientific treatises how to do it books and financial reports we do not wish to leave the impression that we are frivolous or wasting the taxpayers money  the public library is passive rather than activethe bundy survey asked whether the library role should be a passive one of supplying what is requested or whether it should undertake active programs and services of its own as far as the adolescent is concerned it is time for the library world to answer this question do we or do we not believe that it is important enough for teen agers to read books that it behooves us to bestir ourselves instead of leaving the problem entirely up to other institutions polls and surveys tell us that adolescents do very little unassigned reading should public libraries let it go at that posted in one of the booths at the ala conference in san francisco was the following unsigned quotation the time has come for the library to recognize its primary responsibility today is to the other agencies of society and only secondarily to the individual who walks through the doors it was appalling to find such a statement on display in a state library booth and passing unchallenged by delegates to the convention when this view is widely held we shall enjoy the distinction of being the only profession not concerned primarily with the individual does it not follow that when we accept this philosophy we will have ceased to be a profession and will become instead the warehouse for other professions fortunately the way is still open for libraries in large cities to enrich the lives of their adolescents but this will not come about with new gimmicks and original approaches unless the underlying philosophy and present practices in urban libraries change we should hold our informational services to the present high level of performance but should employ the same thinking and planning to bring the promotion of reading to the same level we run our public libraries like supermarkets you put it in the basket we check it out as a result the adolescent often arrives at the checking out point with no books at all or with one he selected from its title or cover and which may turn out to be a bad bargain the bundy survey found that  per cent of the library patrons leave without being completely satisfied librarians generally believe that if books are in order on the shelves the reader in search of a good book has been served if he needs help let him ask the supermarket the automat and public li ibid chap  pp   bid p

 the library quarterly c our argument for teaching all students the use of the catalog is based on a fallacy library literature holds that the student should acquire proficiency in the independent use of library resources as an essential part of his formal education and in support of his continuing self education public librarians have convinced themselves that students now in high school will avidly continue their self education throughout their adult lives for which they will need to make continued use of the tools of research the fact of the matter is that very few will ever put foot in the public library and as stated above half of those who do come will want a good book to read rather than informational material most people pursue their lives unaware of a need for books no one ever inspired them to read for pleasure and they get along without looking up information as for continuing self education that is the last item on their agenda i would guess that not one in a thousand citizens of our big cities is continuing his self education to the extent of needing to do research d the time saved if we gave up our futile attempt to teach everyone to use the catalog could be spent in the intensive promotion of reading instead of teaching the use of the catalog we would have time for more class visits to talk about books for assembly programs on reading for book lists newspaper articles reading clubs for helping individuals on the floor and going out into the community to promote reading the teaching of a skill is not so valuable as the development of a cultural attitude steve allen once introduced on his comedy hour an egghead professor so brilliant he had found an answer for which there was no question librarians teaching the use of the catalog in the past gave many of the disadvantaged adults who never use the library answers for which they have never had a question  we are not meeting new challenges with new ideasit is common knowledge that in the last twenty years the population of the american city has changed in the past the public library catered to the affluent middle class today large numbers of them have fled the city leaving behind the poor the disadvantaged the culturally deprived instead of college bound well fed wellmannered young people we have thousands of adolescents who live in ghettos on relief without a father and with a mother who never passed the third grade in their homes they never hear an interesting conversation or any mention of good taste and ethical standards too many drop out of school commit crimes take dope join mobs and hate all authority and established institutions the whole concept of voluntary reading is foreign to them but all this has made little difference in the public library mode of procedure the books are still on the shelves for those who wish to borrow them this setup which was never successful with the middle class is doomed to failure with the masses here the public library faces its greatest challenge realizing the seriousness of the present crisis the fund for the advancement of education has granted   to vista to equip its workers with portable paperback libraries and has published a guide to show them how to make the best use of the books how to talk about them how to lend them and when and how to give them away in fact how to make books and reading exciting and meaningful for the disadvantaged one of the public library
the urban library and the adolescent  problems has always been our isolation from the masses but the vista worker overcomes that by living as well as working with the people the public library might have taken advantage of this unusual contact to experiment with ways of reaching the disadvantaged with books but it was the educational world that had the inspiration and concern to plan the experiment even so there are other ways of getting into the streets and into the lives of city people if we have creative ideas and dedicated librarians money can be found in his hooked on books d n fader tells how he has influenced the rebellious indifferent delinquents of the maxey school to read three books apiece each week while he is working in a controlled situation and is new to the field his love of books and his success in transmitting enthusiasm for reading are well worth study another suggestion for reaching the public would be a regular national television program sponsored by ala that would dramatize books and reading in such a highly professional effective way that libraries all over the nation would feel its impact another suggestion came to me in a letter from a high school student who had read my comments about the public library he proposed that libraries employ teen agers in the summertime to promote reading with other teenagers if these young people were well trained and supervised they might do an effective job and possibly furnish new recruits for librarianship creative librarians will be able to think of many new approaches to making books truly meaningful to adolescents but whether real progress is made depends largely on the administrator if he believes in reading promotion for the adolescent and gives it his full support half the battle is won but to attain a real breakthrough the administrator needs what david lillienthal considers the highest quality of supervision the ability to release talent to develop the truly creative staff members the administrator with vision and dedication to reading cannot wait for library schools to train his young adult assistants most of them can offer little help he might do better to consult with libraries that have set up effective inservice training programs for young adult librarians then he should find the person on his staff with the widest general reading background and an obvious love for people with such a person as supervisor a do it yourself training program could be set up which coupled with high standards and the release of talent would find its own way toward making reading meaningful and enriching to the city adolescents we are today on the verge of revolution and anarchy in our cities there never was a time when the hordes of negro youth so needed people ideas and institutions to believe in it is time the library reached out to these young people it is time we convinced all adolescents the fortunate the accelerated and the deprived that the public library can furnish them not only the informational material they need but the wonder and joy of reading as well the book is our message hol every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters and he that hath no money come ye buy and eat yea come buy wine and milk without money and without price i daniel n fader and morton h shaevitz hooked on books new york berkley publishing corp  saiah
