gorman gauntlet gender and crying wolf christine pawley the engagement of andrew dillon and april norris with michael gorman critique of library education is reminiscent of the medieval tournament through gorman whither library education and the dillon and norris response crying wolf we an audience of librarians and educators are treated to the spectacle of two powerful white men formally squaring off in a well defined public space each defending his own territory while attacking that of his opponent gorman dean of library services at california state university fresno and   president of the american library association assumes the practitioner voice in speaking for libraries while dillon dean of the school of information at the university of texas at austin and researcher in human computer interaction and attended by his co author student april norris whom we might cast in the role of squire champions the academicians of library and information science lis particularly those at research universities this exchange joins a long line of publications that represent the field of lis education as contested terrain the arguments have a familiar ring like the spectators to the joust we recognize patterned moves commonly expressed as binary pairs  practice versus theory the l word versus the i word people versus technology populism versus elitism what is unusual though is that here we see two men addressing an issue that in lis previously has been raised almost entirely by women that of gender for gorman this constitutes only one among fourteen points but for dillon and norris it is one of three by choosing to focus so particularly on gender they help raise the consciousness of the lis community to ongoing issues of equity and cultural climate most of crying wolf explicit treatment of gender occurs in a section subtitled gendering the instruction of library or information science however the whole article adopts an implicitly gendered stance as the simile of the tournament suggests the very act of engaging in combat through publication has strongly gendered implications drawing on historian suzanne hildenbrand work gorman refers to a growing gender divide in lis schools between nformation science oriented male teachers and library course oriented females teachers gorman links this postulated divide to another social dimension that of age as female library oriented teachers retire he argues they are likely to be replaced by nformation science oriented teachers gorman fails to develop these j of education for library and information science vol  no fall   issn    association for library and information science education
gorman gauntlet  about the author christine pawley is an associate professor school of library and information science and director center for the book the university of iowa christine pawley uiowa edu arguments but dillon and norris devote about one quarter of crying wolf to elaborating and rebutting them while it is true that women participation in library education has changed over time and their faculty status and influence of education have seen periods of decline they declare recent data may denote a movement away from the masculinization of faculty and the gender stratification of faculty ranks the issue of gender and lis resonates with recent discussions in the popular press about the relative under representation of women in science and engineering dillon and norris congratulate lis on achieving a higher rate of female representation than other scientific and technical fields and focus much of their attention in attempting to show that gender equality in terms of parity already exists at least at the level of junior faculty hiring but what kind of equality does parity in numbers hired represent librarianship is a feminized profession in which about  percent of the practitioners are women yet positions of power  faculty positions and directorships of large libraries  have traditionally been disproportionately male it is no accident that the major protagonists in this debate are both men and what about other measures of equality  salaries for instance at all ranks the  academic year salaries of men faculty outstripped those of women sometimes considerably the crying wolf numbers argument follows the tradition of the pipeline theory commonly used to explain the under representation of women in the sciences and engineering according to this theory few women work as professional or academic scientists because few girls go into science and math related classes and programs raising the size of the original pool  increasing the numbers in the pipeline  would be one strategy to address the under representation issue however leaks occur because women drop out of the pool numbers alone will not account for these leakages but possible explanations can be found in a large literature that points to cultural and social factors influencing current contours of work and education emerging career patterns include two career couples and greater mobility between careers such social and cultural factors may affect women disproportionately consideration of these factors complicates the assumptions of the numbers approach it is to their credit that dillon and norris have chosen to focus so much of their article on gender  a pervasive structuring force though one relatively neglected in lis but by continuing to lean so heavily on an overly
 journal of education for library and information science simplistic quantitative method they run the risk of actually perpetuating some of the ways in which gender continues to structure lis education quantitative analysis is attractive because its results are often readily grasped and its significance easily demonstrated part of the allure also lies in the fact that the data may already exist easily adoptable by researchers like dillon and norris anxious to respond in a timely manner to the challenge of a critic like gorman but data are often collected and displayed by organizations including alise and lis schools that are themselves infused with thoroughly gendered ideologies that underlie assumptions about for example what should be included and what left out what is important and what less so the shape and pattern of these data inhere in a set of official texts that form part of the ruling apparatus of lis and that contribute to a narrative that lis uses to present itself to itself as well as to a wider world gendered ideologies lead people to assume that employment policies and procedures have no differential impact on women by comparison with men or vice versa that outcomes for men and women are the same the argument about the aging of lis faculty assumes for instance that large numbers of both men and women will retire as they reach their mid sixties yet women may actually retire in lower numbers than men at that age since their careers are more likely to have been interrupted by family responsibilities and they may not have accumulated a large enough retirement fund to permit them to stop work at a conventional age  where are the data about retirement funds and what other kinds of differentials exist between men and women faculty other than rank and salary what about the distribution of academic goods such as start up funds space graduate assistance and reduced teaching load who teaches the largest classes and conversely who teaches the doctoral seminars the absence of data such as these in the alise statistical report testifies to underlying gendered assumptions about what needs to be reported answers to these questions could fill in some details of lis career patterns and might help explain  or refute  charges of gender inequality here we see the limitations of a broad brush quantitative approach that leaves little room to account for complexities in the life and work situations of men and women lis faculty who teach in different domains dillon and norris go on to look at what they call the magnitude of gender division within curricular offerings claiming to follow conventional assumptions reported by hildenbrand they note that they sampled and evaluated the male to female ratio of a collection of courses categorized as either male or female in their orientation the phrasing used here is of particular note in fact neither gorman nor hildenbrand argue that courses per se are gendered but rather point to the probability of certain kinds of courses being taught by men on the one hand or by women on the other this is a quite different proposition from suggesting that the courses themselves can be described as either male or female or that courses can be gender oriented dillon and norris go even further when they refer to
gorman gauntlet  classically defined female courses and classically defined male courses here conventional assumptions have mutated into the even stronger classic definitions implying that such course characterizations are not only common today but are of long standing what does it mean to claim that a course rather than its instructor is female or male and what can we infer from this slippage about these authors understanding of gender as an axis of social analysis first it is important to remember the strongest historical association between gender and the library science curriculum is between women instructors and children literature and services until mergers with information science accelerated during the  s all the other courses that dillon and norris now associate predominantly with women were mostly taught by men  who as late as the s outnumbered women faculty by two to one indeed reference gendered female according to dillon and norris has historically been an area of considerable prestige on which many men have centered their careers in contrast to that other core library activity cataloging n the claim to classic definition and even to conventional assumption is more than a considerable over statement  it is actually misleading and demonstrates both an ignorance of lis history and an ahistorical understanding of the operation of gender as a diachronic social dimension second the transference of the qualifiers male and female to the courses themselves allows dillon and norris to sidestep perhaps unwittingly a real underlying difference between l courses and i courses  that they are stratified by status in accordance with a long term effort by lis faculty to present their field as scientific in nature and thus worthy of higher prestige power and access to material resources than fields in the arts and humanities a project that long predated the introduction of information science perhaps library science faculty welcomed information scientists in increased numbers into their ranks in the late  s and early s at least in part because they believe this would boost their claims to scientific status as well as increase their size and help fend off the threat of school closing that was a nightmarish reality for fifteen schools between  and  the introduction of more courses in information science  its reliance on quantitative methods apparently imbuing it with greater scientific authenticity  meant that library science courses like reference that previously occupied positions near the top of the status ladder found themselves pushed down a few rungs the operation of this status differential combined with the possibility that women may feel that they have no choice but to accept lower status course assignments along with lower pay and adjunct work  could be a far more powerful explanation of the distribution of courses by gender than any supposed male or female characterization of content paradoxically in view of their modernist progressivist language dillon and norris  like gorman  adopt a quite traditional view of the library and information field this is the notion that useful informationan undifferentiated commodity that can be quantified stored and retrieved  is
 journal of education for library and information science what counts in lis thus they fall prey to what wayne a wiegand describes as tunnel vision and blind spots and ignore the fact that the majority of public library patrons  millions of them every year  go to the library to check out cultural products including books that they then take home and read nowhere in either of these articles do the contenders consider that reading is central to what libraries do far less that it should take a central place in the lis curriculum of schools can one of the reasons for this view have something to do with the fact that there is a long standing perception that it is primarily women and children who use the public library in this way and what of a related argument  one that rarely receives attention in lis literature  that reading is itself a highly gendered activity with boys far more likely than girls to fall behind in reading the absence of reading studies from the lis curriculum is attributable at least in part to the conferring of higher status on science and technology oriented courses and a consequently lesser value on humanities oriented courses lastly talk of female courses and male courses promotes the notion that there is something inherently gendered about these courses  something intrinsically male about information science courses like text retrieval and database design and something intrinsically female about library science courses like collection management and reference this thinking betrays a form of essentialism  the belief that gender is a fixed and natural property rather than a form of social relationship continuously historically negotiated and renegotiated and that it can inhere not only in people but also in cultural and social products like academic courses it hard to believe that either these authors or their readers actually think of courses as inherently male or female but this imprecise use of language suggests that in their haste to take up gorman gauntlet dillon and norris have opened their arguments to precisely the same accusations of poor quality that they themselves level against research in lis in general language matters as rosalind williams comments the ideology of technological change is full of tough guy rhetoric about the need to stay out in front to beat the competition to work  to keep ahead in a brutal environment not a world for girls of course no one ever says directly that women are excluded from technological innovation but the emphasis on the constant brutal demands of the high tech workplace implies once again that they have to make a choice between work and family such language  endemic in technical fields  when imported into lis constrains men and women to conform to a muscular high tech stereotype at the same time other language works to exclude men from lis domains associated with women like children literature and services far more difficult for many in lis to imagine than the female instructor of information science is the male instructor of children literature perhaps a more telling index of gender parity than the proportion of women teaching information science courses might be the proportion of men teaching courses on working with children
gorman gauntlet  it seems evident that the participants in this joust like many librarians and lis faculty members fail to see gender in relational terms as the operation of ongoing social relationships instead they reductively equate it with a male female dichotomy embodied in biological difference to some extent this is a result of the disciplinary insularity of which dillon and norris themselves complain during the last quarter of the twentieth century social analysts have come to recognize that gender is not about women or even about men and women but rather that it represents a set of social relationships along with class and race a mode through which relations of power are claimed and constructed in the words of historian linda kerber yet most lis faculty members with some notable exceptions including suzanne hildenbrand herself show little awareness of the very large body of scholarship that has stemmed from this fundamental conceptual breakthrough in their eagerness to take up the gorman challenge dillon and norris like gorman himself tend to adopt combative and polarizing language appropriate to the tournament but perhaps less productive in the real world their article demonstrates a need for more research as well as for truly gender oriented classes in the lis curriculum  classes that acquaint students and faculty with recent theoretical perspectives and research on gender the technological turn was not the only cause of intellectual upheaval in the field of lis in the  s noticed by far fewer lis commentators but arguably as cataclysmic in its implications the interpretive revolution associated with postmodern theory that had influenced the social sciences and humanities since at least the late s finally began to have an impact on lis by the early s this movement emphasized the search for meaning as opposed to causal factors and coincided with a new awareness of gender class and race spurred by the civil rights and feminist movements that also dated back to the s and s belatedly a new focus on diversity began to make the overwhelmingly white male composition of university faculty an embarrassment on many campuses reflection on this genuine revolution in lis is sorely lacking an absence that reinforces the view that the only real revolution has been a technological one and forestalls consideration of the fundamentally gendered nature of the profession and its education dillon and norris deserve congratulations for taking on the complex topic of gender now their article should spur us  librarians and lis faculty  to a level of analysis that is both more nuanced and theoretically aware an extensive literature analyzes gender and technological innovation one that information scientists especially those concerned with human factors as well as those who study libraries would do well to explore the tournament  the ritualized debate in print  plays a useful function in gaining our attention but just as in medieval times the real action lies elsewhere only by purposefully redirecting our attention as well as reframing our language can we address issues of gender equity effectively
