the library quarterly volume v october  number methods for making known to inexperienced readers the resources and facilities offered by american public librariesi o wur instructions are to present a survey covering primarily american viewpoints and practices with regard to one of the large and important aspects of public library work namely how to help readers to get what they want first then it is well to recognize that american public libraries have been undergoing a marked development in their more intensive and purposeful services this is doubtless both a cause and an effect the american public regardless of its libraries is unquestionably more serious minded and ambitious than ever in its study and reading interests this despite the counter attractions of radio movies automobiles and jazz it is evidenced by the market for substantial books the constantly increasing number and circulation of subject magazines the flood of useful pamphlets bulletins and reports from a myriad of organizations rapidly increasing enrolment of students in high schools colleges and graduate schools organization of leisure time avocations or hobbies by groups and individuals of every type and in every subject and finally by the general tendency of the american people to prepare themselves more carefully in the knowledge of their daily vocations to read more i from a paper presented at the second international congress of libraries and bibliography held at madrid spain may  
 the library quarterly widely for general culture and to encourage research in the industrial civic and economic problems which face each community and the organizations within it it doubtless could be proved that american libraries have definitely influenced the whole movement through their services and their publicity the writer has the conviction that the long campaign in this direction on the part of many american public libraries large and small has made america more and more book conscious increased the number of readers given the public new reading interests notably raised the quality of books borrowed still more notably increased the volume and personal helpfulness of reference work done and built up between this public institution and its constituents an understanding that on both sides is most cordial appreciative and helpful but someone else could just as easily prove that because high school education has become more nearly universal because colleges high schools and even grade schools have changed their methods of teaching and now advocate supplementary required reading reading for honors projects and reports instead of the old single textbook the heavy demnand for library books has resulted from such causes others could doubtless prove that it is the publishers with their widespread high power advertising who have had the paramount influence it might be taken as a principle that public libraries have a constant definite obligation to influence public opinion toward reading and study they should discover effective means to this end some of these methods to interest the public at large in books and reading will be reviewed in this paper before considering the devices which libraries are using to develop intensive and scholarly work on the part of a larger and larger proportion of the public much could be said as to the need for a co operative campaign by publishers booksellers and librarians to keep the idea of books and the pleasures of reading always before the public the public library obligation is not primarily in the one direction of intensive service to a selected few but is equally in

 the library tuarterly what community conditions or library services make possible such high enrolment of the population in certain cities and towns some of them obviously have to do with the general intellectual status of the community as for example the high proportion of intellectual workers concentrated in the national capital city of washington or the large groups of leisured persons enjoying years of retirement as in the pacific coast cities of san diego and los angeles the high general cultural interest and background in cities like springfield massachusetts stimulated by strong institutions and societies and by the presence of a large proportion of skilled labor of the specialized craft type many small residential towns of unified population type eg fort wayne ind are in contrast to communities with concentrated uncultured groups foreign backgrounds colored etc whose individuals have not had equal opportunities we note that in every one of these cases of exceptional results the library itself has a long standing reputation for consistent zealous efficient service and a policy of encouraging both the extensive and intensive aspects of its work this description fits the great cleveland library system operating in a city of heterotable ii registrlation pert population circulation pert capita percentage cruainprcpt special cities percentage_  or   or   or   or  springfield mass  ii o   i    i  providence ri   isi   i si    fort wayne and allen county  t    t  i cleveland ohio   i        i   westfield mass i  t i  ii t i   t flint mich    i    i i american library annual r r f letter from fort wayne registration in  was for five year period i westfield athenaeum nnusual repors r i springfield city library annual report p i bulletin of tht american library auociation xxviii    american library association public library statistics cities with population between iooooo and   mimeographed report

 the library tuarterly this problem of sufficient copies of worth while fiction and some non fiction goes along in the public mind with the more embarrassing one of refusing to supply what english librarians often refer to as tripe it raises the perennial question of the function of the american public library in supplying fiction of no earthly literary or cultural value one way to settle it is to withdraw to an upper room take out our little brass idol of scholarship and warm and dandle it on our knees hoping that the world will notice our erudition and culture does this settle it meanwhile the public at large betakes itself to increasing numbers of commercial circulating libraries if we are to keep the mass of american readers within the helpful constructive influence of our public library service we will continue to look upon our function as that of supplying all the book needs of the people we will nevertheless draw a line at the tripe but will give such prompt full interested and sympathetic service on good current fiction that the publir will depend on the public library public library rental collections are hardly anywhere developed to their full scale of operation too few libraries look upon them as on the main line we shall consider the growth the existence of commercial libraries with their indiscriminate stock in morals as well as literary values not with complaisance nor as an excuse for us to abdicate our trust but as a reflection upon our effectiveness a proof that we have placed false literary and intellectual values above the great social value of the public library our own library rejoices in having reduced the number of new fiction titles purchased to only two hundred and fifty a year perhaps we have gone too far after traveling through england large cities and little villages and seeing the appalling mass of tripe under the very nose of the whole nation in commercial libranres and the comparatively small public library use of worthy fiction and non fiction one prays that american libraries may solve this problem wisely to these chief difficulties should be added many minor ones such as those noted by douglas waplesi the perplexities and op cit p

methods for making known library resources  i instruction of young people in the use of books and libraries a generation of school children well instructed in the use of books and libraries and instilled with the joy of reading will produce a future clientele of active adult library users this statement so often made by librarians must be seriously qualified for the fact is that a considerable proportion of young people even in good library communities do not get across the gulf of upper high school to resume public library use in adult years the psychological reasons for this are still unexplored during the last few years instruction in the use of libraries given to pupils in the public and private schools of america has developed to an extent nothing short of surprising and in general it is of high quality in some cities the instruction is given by the board of education through its school libraries and english teachers in others by the public library either through the school libraries which it may maintain or by classes visiting at the neighboring branch libraries or through material the public library provides for teachers in the junior and senior high schools to include in their regular english courses the organization of this instruction depends on the general relationship between the public library and the public school system and especially upon who operates and directs the school libraries in several cities where it has been initiated by the public library it has eventually been taken over and made a part of the publicschool course of instruction with the spread of required standards and the supervision of school libraries by state units it seems only a few years distant when the topic will be included as a college entrance requirement it is highly desirable that librarians take active steps to bring about this result it seems logical that those who have been taught in school how to read should be instructed in the methods and materials that will help them to keep on reading and learning as long as they live universal instruction concerning books children literature and the use of libraries is another goal to be won as soon as possible in all teacher training institutions

methods for miking known library resources   publicity and instruction as to book collections and reference services and tools the general instruction for both young people and adults represents the worthy attempt of many american libraries to reach en masse the crowds of prospective or present patrons helping them to become familiar with the library and its ways and to make a first approach to really intensive book use we now come to our final topic in many ways the most interesting of all namely the attempt to encourage more real study and research work not only among professional and scholarly persons but among a larger and larger portion of the general adult public this high purpose of american libraries has been emphasized only during the last few years and the methods followed are still in their early stages many librarians and library workers have overlooked the fact that out of the thousands of their present library borrowers only a very few of even the best readers college professors for instance know anything about library reference services and reference tools many of these tools for example the i edition of webster new international dictionary or the standard catalogfor public libraries in its complete edition or the dictionary of american biography or any one of a score of other refer ence tools have behind them stories of purpose effort and achievement nothing short of exciting and inspiring the public at large would be interested in these accomplishments so typical of modern organized co operative scholarship libraries may well capitalize the publicity value of their reference services and tools to a greater extent until the huge mass of reference material now in public libraries is advertised described and made known to the general public our reference work will by no means reach its possiblities instruction of the public in reference aids begins with general publicity to attract and inform some of the large american lii braries have done outstanding work in this direction los angeles maintains poster exhibits and bulletin boards in each ot

methods for making known library resources  pages until she came to the correct name and address a third placard gave the answer to the question other inquiries came in one after another over the telephone and the assistant in the same manner looked up the information in the correct books each step was explained by carefully lettered placards made ready in advance thousands of persons who stopped for some moments to watch the exhibit were made aware for the first time that this type of service was rendered by the library from which many of them had been borrowing books for years without ever using its reference department in another library window exhibits were shown of vertical file material pamphlets documents etcwith colored ribbons running from the piece of printed matter in the vertical file down to the explanatory placards placed in the foreground of the window there are many other devices to let the general public know about reference tools and the ability of the library to help students such are the circulars describing reference tools in detail the cleveland library has a pamphlet using the library explaining what may be found in encyclopedias dictionaries and the specialized type of reference books such as statistical handbooks atlases volumes of formulas quotations and brief biographies this pamphlet explains also the use of magazine indexes cleveland issues a separate leaflet how to find technical facts explaining reference aids in the field of technology and applied arts the public library of the district of columbia in its guides to information enumerates similar reference aids after examining these samples we cannot escape the familiar question as to why a hundred or five hundred libraries do not join in producing an attractive illustrated handbook or series of leaflets on the use of the most common reference tools and distribute it free and freely it is not difficult to predict some such outcome from the increasing interest in this aspect of american library work nor can we help imagining the many steps which remain to be taken in helping students of a more scholarly type in using library resources the preparation of brief manuals for
