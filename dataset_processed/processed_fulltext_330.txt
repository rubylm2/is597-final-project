three generations of the soviet intelligentsia leopold h haimson i o pf the many issues that have been reopened in the healthy atmosphere of puzzlement and controversy that has enveloped western studies of the soviet union since the end of the stalin era perhaps the most important has been the broad question of the attitudes and role that the soviet intelligentsia may be expected to display in the future development of the soviet system it might of course be observed that the uncertainty which now prevails about this question merely illustrates once again the truth of the old adage that there are no experts on the soviet union only persons of varying degrees of ignorance yet it might perhaps be useful to consider precisely in what respects the developments of the post stalin era have cast a shadow of doubt on the assumptions about the soviet intelligentsia that we had come to entertain during the last years of stalin life i think it may be fairjy stated that nothing about the developments of the post stalin thawincluding the opportunities that they created for many of us to come into much closer contact with the soviet intelligentsia has tended to change our picture of the external pressures to which during the stalin era and even in its aftermath the intelligentsia was subjected by the regime of the process of ideological indoctrination that they underwent in childhood and youth of the nature of the political controls that governed their adult lives of the rewards they could expect for conformity and of the penalties they might have to pay for defiance in these respects our image of the stalin era has now become considerably more precise and more shaded to be sure we now have a far clearer picture of the exquisite variations in the penalties that the regime imposed on recalcitrant intellectuals and academicians from demotion to provincial institutions and administrative exile in northern russia and siberia to imprisonment in concentration camps or ultimate liquidation we also now know considerably more about the institutionalized methods of accommodation and avoidance that intellectuals used and the regime tolerated even at the height of its ideological campaigns in certain disciplines such as the curious migration of soviet logicians from the naked glare of the institutes of philosophy to the more private haven of the various institutes of mathematics that took place during the official craze about dialectic logic still the basic picture remains unaltered the ubiquitous courses in diamat dialectical materialism were and continue to be as sterile and as boring as we surmised they were essenin and so many other brilliant literary figures did in fact disappear zoshchenko was not and for that matter still is not allowed to publish yet notwithstanding the apparent reliability of our knowledge of these conditions of soviet intellectual life during the past quarter of a century two broad areas of uncertainty concerning their effects appear to me to have been ex zoshchenko has died since these lines were written 
three generations of the soviet intelligentsia  posed in the glare of the post stalin thaw the first of these centers on the nature of the internal responses that soviet intellectuals actually make to the pressures to which they are subjected at any one time to what degree are individuals minds and hearts actually molded by the pressures of the regime to what degree and in what specific forms do they actually absorb the values and styles of thought that it seeks to impose upon them and if variations occur in these internal adjustments what significant causes underlie the variety of individual responses inherent in the second area of our present uncertainty about the soviet intelligentsia is the even broader and more complex question of the relative permanence or impermanence of the conditions that totalitarian systems create assuming that at any particular time the members of the intelligentsia responded to the pressures of the system with a particular pattern of attitudes of values and of thought what can we say about the relative permanence of the pattern of these responses what are we in a position to predict concerning their future evolution one should i think be frank to admit that in the years since stalin death a quite radical change has occurred in our thinking about the two broad problems that i have just raised in the immediate postwar period we witnessed a prevalent tendency among western observers to view the soviet system as indeed all totalitarian societies through largely orwellian eyes as altogether omnipotent systems endowed not merely with a capacity to control the overt behavior of their subjects but also with the monstrous ability to manipulate their every feeling and every thought by virtue of this extraordinary ability that they were presumed to possess these systems were then regarded as almost rocklike monoliths largely impervious to pressures of change at best certain observers foresaw the possibility that conditions might gradually arise under which external pressures on soviet intellectual life would be significantly reduced but only because the new soviet intelligentsia as indeed the entire generation of the new soviet manwould have fully internalized the values and rules of the system in such a world of faithful depersonalized automata totalitarianism by terror would have been superseded by an even more sweeping totalitarianism by consent if many succumbed to such nightmarish visions during the last years of stalin life it would appear that most recently as if by some sort of internal dialectic our thinking about the soviet intelligentsia has swung to an opposite extreme to the image of a contemporary intelligentsia generally seething with unrest and discontent and to the optimistic picture of a future in which the members of this intelligentsia ever more powerful and ever more discontented will subject the soviet regime to irresistible pressures for fundamental changes the violent swings of opinion that have occurred during the last five years concerning the current attitudes and outlook of the soviet intelligentsia and the deductions that may be drawn from them for the future provide the clearest indication of the uncertainty of our present knowledge and conclusions about these two questions yet the problems are so fundamental the issues that they raise appear so central in the formulation of our expectations about future contacts with the soviet union that
 the library quarterly some treatment of them however inconclusive it may prove would appear in order in this discussion ii in attempting to gauge the impact that the soviet experience has had on the contemporary intelligentsia it is first of all necessary to bring to mind that after forty years of soviet rule we now find represented on the soviet intellectual scene a variety of groups of different ages and social origin which have been subjected in the course of their development to environmental influences of quite different character and intensity these four decades in the life of the intelligentsia have encompassed a variety of complex interacting processes and patterns of change changes in the character and appeals of official ideology as gradually from the vision of an unrealized revolutionary utopia this ideology was transformed partly into a set of ritualistic utterances and practices partly into an elaborate system of rationalizations for already existent stabilized institutions changes in the intelligentsia relationship to authority as the still relatively free and in some respects even antiauthoritarian intellectual climate of the early and middle  was gradually replaced by the rigidly orthodox intellectual atmosphere and the ubiquitous controls of the stalin era changes in the social composition and in the sense of social identity of the intelligentsia that reflected in turn the great social overturns and dislocations of the late  and early  and the subsequent stabilization of soviet society and last but not least the changes of emphasis in the intelligentsia intellectual pursuits and concerns that occurred in the wake of the second socialist offensive with the emergence full grown of a technologically and scientifically oriented society each of these processes and patterns of change has left its mark on the members of the contemporary soviet intelligentsia but the precise character of their imprint has differed substantially from one group of the intelligentsia to another perhaps the most notable of these variations or at least the one that strikes the western visitor most forcibly is the difference indeed the psychological distance between generations a visitor quickly draws the impression that after forty years of turmoil the confrontation between adjoining age groups has become marked by a gaping chasm that almost no meaningful continuities no significant points of contact appear to bridge three major age groups stand out in one image of this confrontation the generation that had already reached intellectual maturity before the bolsheviks seizure of power or at least before the imposition in the  of totalitarian controls over soviet intellectual life the middle generation of the intelligentsia the generation of those between say the ages of thirty five and fifty who spent almost all their adult life stifling under what has come so quaintly to be called the cult of personality and finally the group of young men and women who while largely educated under stalin have begun to make their presence felt on the intellectual scene only under the more clement and chaotic conditions of the post stalin thaw the survivors of the pre revolutionary generation of the intelligentsia are now few in number yet one is struck by the extraordinary prominence and influence of the position that they still exercise on the intellectual particularly the academic scene one finds these aging symbols of the past complete down to
three generations of the soviet intelligentsia  their redingotes pinces nez and small van dyke beards still occupying the major chairs in russian universities one finds them still editing the major works published by the academy of sciences and still scurrying with a busy and proprietary air about the halls and offices of its various institutes occasionally one even finds them in their studios or salons eagerly presiding over gatherings of young adepts of literature and the arts how do these men seem to be faring after four decades of war revolution penury and terror they seem much older of course more frayed and more fragile but at the core they appear remarkably unchanged through these years of continuous pressure and stress most of them have managed somehow to hold onto the basic interests the values and personal style of life that they originally carved out for themselves and even their energy their zest for existence seems unimpaired while talking with one of these aging figures it sometimes seems as if one were resuming a conversation interrupted for thirty or forty years exactly at the point where one had left it the names of the same authors the titles of the same books are cited the same intellectual and aesthetic standards the same basic likes and dislikes are expressed all this is not to imply that these men have maintained an active or even a passive belligerence toward the soviet regime quite the contrary most of them seem to have made their peace with it if only by burying themselves in the confines of their professional work indeed at those critical moments when the world threatened to engulf them many made the pragmatic crass compromise of writing books or delivering lectures in no word of which they believed and even now while occasionally indulging in a smirk of satisfaction as they bask in the glow of the measure of recognition that the post stalin era has brought them they generally display in their conduct the prudence or at least the circumspection of wily old men yet what really appears most worthy of emphasis is how minimal an impress the pressures of the last forty years seem to have made on this generation of the intelligentsia to be sure the regime did largely succeed in controlling the nature of their writings and public utterances although even in this sphere its success was not unqualified at the very height of the stalin era many particularly among the literateurs apparently continued to seek their own truths and to record their own thoughts and while the products of their efforts could not usually be published they often received wide circulation in manuscript form to this day some of the poems most popular in certain intelligentsia circles have never appeared in print most important of all the regime failed to effect any significant changes in this generation inner thoughts and inner values and it did not even really subdue their will despite the rules of caution that they had to learn despite the repeated experiences of torment and self humiliation that they had to undergo many of these old men have somehow managed to survive without any fatal injury to the integrity of their inner selves their sense of personal identity and personal dignity their interest in and zest for life have remained miraculously intact i vividly recall the passing comment of a prominent literary historian of this generation during a visit to a bookstore about a series of volumes that he himself had edited pointing to the more re
 the library quarterly cent volumes in this series he explained to me with complete aplomb and in impeccable if somewhat dated french slang these particular volumes still smell i afraid they appeared a little too early i remember another conversation about russian historiography with a stout and generally formidablelooking old russian historian the author of monumental works on the early history of russia at the end of this talk during which he had cited only standard pre soviet works on the subject he observed in the most casual manner it is a pity that miliukov never finished his book on russian historical thought nothing to make up for it has been published in recent years the fact that miliukov a prominent leader of the liberal kadet party and the first foreign minister of the provisional government in  has been denounced for many years as an arch reactionary had not ostensibly entered my interlocutor mind and finally as typical of the tone that this generation imparts i recall a talk with an aged and sickly writer a jew who had suffered much in the hands of the regime during the last years of stalin life despite all the disappointments that he had undergone this ailing old man was still genuinely filled with hope and brushing aside my own expressions of skepticism he valiantly strove to infuse me with his rosy nineteenth century faith in the inherent goodness of the russian people and in the vast promise of modern scientific progress the sources of the inner resilience of the inner security and assurance that the members of this generation commonly display appear largely to have been drawn i think from the old intelligentsia traditions and style of life to which they have so tenaciously clung the manifestations of these traditions appear as varied as the character of these men own early pre revolutionary or pre stalinist experience many particularly those who spent some of their student years in western europe have remained identified in their thoughts in their values even in their speech and their mannerisms with the universal european culture that they absorbed during their youth others have sunk their roots deep in the history and culture of the russian past and they have found in these traditions of the past a secure basis for their own identity others still have somehow kept intact despite the experience of the post revolutionary years the touching cult of the people the innocent golden populist credo of the old intelligentsia left it might perhaps be said that for many of these men life came to a standstill thirty or forty years ago but the experiences of these earlier years has served them as a buttress and as a source of nurture to the present day iii the contrast between these old men of the russian intelligentsia and those who immediately followed in their footsteps is of dramatic and tragic proportions if the survivors of the old generation impress one with the continued preeminence of their position the members of the second generation the men and women who spent all their adult lives under stalin rule strike one by contrast by their lack of real vigor and influence in many spheres of the contemporary intellectual scene what has happened to this middle generation of the intelligentsia an age group which usually exercises so prominent a role in a country intellectual life to a degree the impression that it is
three generations of the soviet intelligentsia  largely absent from the stage is in fact justified for this we must recall is the generation that was most nakedly exposed to and was most heavily decimated by the ravages of the great purges of the  the carnage of the war years and the obscurantist reaction of the postwar period yet physical bloodletting provides only part of the explanation since many in this age group actually managed to survive indeed in far more considerable numbers than their elders and their physical presence on the contemporary scene is by no means difficult to discern these survivors are not all of a type some have the somewhat abrupt business like manners the curious rigidity in personal intercourse the broad squarish physical features characteristic of the new intelligentsia that was largely recruited from the ranks during the great social overturns of the  and early  but some seem to reflect just as unmistakably in their speech and mannerisms the imprint of intelligentsia descendance and upbringings many are to be found in positions of bureaucratic or at least official responsibility they are administrators in universities and institutes party hacks of the press literature and the arts who have spent all their lives organizing controlling and manipulating soviet culture in accordance with changing official dogmas but some have also survived among the subjects of this official class the scholars and artists who were compelled to produce under the strictures of the official keepers of orthodoxy perhaps the most important distinction to be drawn within the ranks of this generation one which overshadows even if it largely coincides with the difference between masters and subjects official types and those whom they control is the distinction between the immediate descendants of the old and the members of the new intelligentsia ie the men and women who were recruited from non intelligentsia strata usually through the party in the postrevolutionary years between the oldest generation of the intelligentsia and their own immediate descendants particularly in the fields of literature and the arts there do appear to exist some notable differences but they are largely differences of an emotional rather than an intellectual character in contrast to the impression of vigor and zest that most of the old men so abundantly convey many of their children appear to be facing the future with a quite deeply felt feeling of futility and hopelessness indicative of their general mood is the answer that i received from a quite successful middleaged dramatist a pupil of vakhtangov and thus one of the few prominent survivors of the golden age of the soviet experimental theater when i asked this man what one might expect in the future of the younger the third generation of the intelligentsia nothing was his reply nothing at all the young people don really want anything they just want to construct little boxes art is dead it will be hard very hard to resurrect such an aura of futility and defeat continues to be evoked by this group of the middle generation of the intelligentsia despite the fissures that have appeared since stalin death in the edifice of official orthodoxy and the hesitant limited almost intangible but nonetheless quite real sense of movement that then began to permeate certain spheres of soviet intellectual life why this general and deep seated pes
 the library quarterly simism it might well be argued particularly in the light of the official reaction that has followed the hungarian uprising that this pessimism has been justified but such an argument would not be particularly germane for what needs to be explained is an attitude which to a considerable degree is confined to the members of this one generation while any answer must necessarily remain speculative i would suggest that perhaps the most relevant fact is that the intellectuals in this age group have had to spend almost all their lives in a world out of control a world which subjected many of them to early disillusionment and which compelled almost all of them in order to survive to sully themselves with gestures of abject submission or compromise and most important of all unlike their elders the members of this middle age group had to travel on their arid journey without the buttress of a personal set of values and code of life without the memory however brief or remote of a meaningful and unsullied past in short without the basis for an independent identity that could resist the incursions of their engulfing contemporary environment some of these middle aged intellectuals will occasionally wistfully refer in conversation to the intelligentsia traditional heroes and their works but these are but secondhand memories with which they have no immediate connections and from which they can draw little emotional comfort and resources most of these men appear to have come out of the long night of the stalin era utterly spent and if they look to the future with such apprehension it is in part perhaps because they face it themselves with no inner reserves of energy of faith of self respect left to contribute it should be noted that those of the intellectuals of this generation who were subjected to administrative exile or imprisonment during the stalin era and who therefore had little occasion or tendency to comnpromise present a striking contrast to those who remained free the survivors of these deportees who have returned to the contemporary intellectual scene since the governmental amnesty appear remarkably unbroken they seem assured fearless indeed not unhopeful and it is they who have now assumed whatever position of intellectual leadership this generation is still able to offer but the smell of defeat is not entirely confined within this middle age group to those descendants of the older generation of the intellectual class who remained in the main current of soviet intellectual life throughout the stalin era to a lesser degree such an auraor at least the signs of almost equal uncertainty and disorientation may now be discerned among many in the new intelligentsia that the party recruited from lower social strata and hastily trained in the late  and early  discerned even in the most hardened bureaucrats whom one encounters on the present soviet cultural scene to be sure when one sees them sitting behind their big desks or presiding at the head of their long greenfelt conference tables these heavy set official types of soviet cultural life still look quite formidable and they still display considerable authority as they deliver themselves of the latest platitudes of the official cultural line and yet an observer quickly draws the impression as he watches their dealings with their younger subordinates that these men are largely going through empty motions that they have lost much of their
three generations of the soviet intelligentsia  confidence in the significance of their acts and in the importance of their positions what has happened since stalin death to upset so rudely the confidence and self esteem of these men who in their lifetime have successfully weathered so many crises no doubt they were in some degree puzzled and embarrassed by the modest reassertion of traditional cultural values and by the attendant confusion in government policy that occurred in the wake of the denunciation of the cult of personality to a western visitor the manifestations of their plight seem often quite comical i well recall a session at one of the institutes of the academy of sciences at which one such official type solemnly reproached himself for having failed to pay adequate attention in the past to of all people the russian idealist philosophers of the nineteenth century but the significance of such ludicrous spectacles should not be overdrawn any more than the liberalism of current government policies after all this is not the first time that these men have been faced with the necessity of having to praise one day what they had had to condemn the day before it seems to me that the really significant blow that the bureaucrats of soviet cultural life and more generally the middle aged group of the new intelligentsia have had to suffer as the result of the post stalin thaw has been the shattering of the image that they had entertained of their relation not to the old but to the new to the officially sponsored culture with all their servile conformance to the twists and turns of government policy with all the personal ruthlessness that most of them displayed in ideological and bureaucratic infighting many in this middle generation of the new intelligentsia it must be remembered were sustained throughout the stalin era by an ideal which gave them energy and purpose they viewed themselves during those long years not just as policemen or sycophants but as agents in the birth and shaping of a new and different culture as participants in the creation of a new and different intelligentsia an intelligentsia that would be as energetic disciplined and down to earth as the old one had seemed to them anarchic and divorced from practical realities a culture that would be as rational and purposive as successfully committed to vast collective efforts to master and control the earth on which it stood as the old culture had seemed to them passive diffuse immobilized in the morass of formless and empty dreams to understand the naivete and the crudeness of the vision to account for the hardiness of its survival through the sordid vagaries of the stalin era one needs to recall that its keepers entered russian intellectual life as outsiders with no backlog of intellectual traditions or experience to guide them the official ideology and cosmogony that they had absorbed and further simplified provided literally the only key the only frame of reference that many of them had for the explication of intellectual phenomena the role that the party had defined for them provided their only conception of proper and suitable activity in the development of russian culture thus being themselves so much the creations as well as the agents of the party in a world utterly divorced from their earlier experience many of them had little occasion to question the party objectives or to doubt the legitimacy of their own mission but now after thirty years this sense
 the library quarterly of historic destiny has finally been undone this has come about partly as the result of the recent changes in the party policies but mainly i think because the culture these men had dreamed of finally came to life and in the chaos of the post stalin era began to assert its presence in the last analysis what appears to have been most unsettling for these men in the changes that have occurred in the course of the post stalin thaw in the party cultural line has not been so much the party vague hesitant gestures at ideological liberalization gestures that were often retracted almost as soon as they were made rather it has been the rising tendency on the part of the regime to indicate in its references to the sacred dialectic of theory and practice that the achievement of success even in certain cultural spheres depended in its eyes more on practical skill and experience however delimited and circumscribed than on the rituals of theory and dogma it is after all precisely in this realm of professional ability and skill that the new intelligentsia of the middle generation cannot help sensing its inferiority to the young men and women who have begun to assert their presence on the contemporary intellectual scene the men of the stalin era have been partly defeated by the very measure of their success the younger generation of the intelligentsia is proving itself in the main as rational as purposive as down to earth as devoid of the fatal inclination to vast and frivolous theoretical flights in short as seemingly useful and politically safe as its makers could have dared to dream at the same time it is as steeped in certain scientific values and skills as fully acclimated to certain forms of intellectual experiences and pursuits as its makers were not and it is precisely by virtue of these intellectual accomplishments and limitations that in many areas of intellectual life the members of the younger generation have begun to express the sense of their superiority over the new intelligentsia of the stalin era and to assert the superfluousness of their tutelage yet the sense of conflict and psychological distance that many in the middle generation of the new intelligentsia have begun to draw from their contacts with the young also reflects the measure of their historic failure for what is also characteristic of most of the young men and women who have come to the fore is that while they do appear to be politically safe while they may have fully absorbed the general ideological framework and values that their makers sought to impress upon them they take this framework and these values for granted they perceive them as the limits rather than as the center of their world as these young men and women look at the new intelligentsia of the stalin era most of them can only entertain and to a degree express an attitude of indifference or even repugnance and disdain themselves dreamless or animated by quite different and far more personal dreams they cannot believe in or often perceive the large and inhuman visions that animated them their desire to strive and their willingness to strain for the realization of vast impersonal collective endeavors they can see in them only despotic uncultured obsolescent men who are ignorant of the very intellectual skills and scientific values in the name of which they purport to speak we still have far too many people who talk about things they don know anything about a young soviet scholar
three generations of the soviet intelligentsia  told me within the hearing of an official of his institute who had just delivered a long and windy speech in the face of such verdicts by the very products of the culture that they strove so hard to mold the bureaucrats of the stali era and generally most of the new intelligentsia of the middle generation whatever the power and authority they may still hold have finally begun to feel their age and some of the uselessness of their presence iv the young men and women between the ages of twenty five and thirty five who are now making their way on the soviet intellectual scene are truly the children of the stalin era all their lives they have known no other social order no other ideology no other explicit vision of man and society than those that the regime imposed upon them and yet the gloomy forecasts to which so many in the western world succumbed at the height of stalin rule as they visualized his monolithic all pervasive totalitarian state giving birth to a new race of depersonalized subjects have somehow not come to pass this is not to say that the failure of the regime has been unqualified or that the nature of its failure is by any means immediately apparent indeed a western visitor is likely to draw from his first contacts with most of the young men and women of the intelligentsia an impression of almost universal ideological uniformity a sense of the most appalling kind of sameness about the assumptions that these young people voice and particularly the terminology that they employ whenever broad political social or philosophical questions are raised thirty years ago a significant percentage of the younger generation would undoubtedly have rejected or at least have ignored official ideological categories but today almost every one of them considers himself a socialist in politics and a materialist in philosophy believes in the marxist interpretation of history and generally venerates the leninist heritageabout as unquestioningly as an american schoolboy accepts a stereotyped image of the american revolution it is only as a visitor acquaintances become more intimate and as his conversations descend from the heights of generality and abstraction that he discovers that although official categories may be universally espoused and official terms universally employed by the members of this generation these have ceased to provide a reliable guide to the character of individual tastes attitudes and thoughts a young logician may call himself a materialistand if you prod him comfortably defend the basic tenets of materialist philosophy but this surface orthodoxy has not restrained him from absorbing like a sponge the positivist outlook of most western logicians into his thinking about the specific problems that he encounters in his work a young artist may consider himself a realist even while he is searching in the western and russian aesthetic traditions for richer and more complex aesthetic forms young intellectuals generally may fervently aspire to a political and social climate that would be more open to free and individual self expression and at the same time stoutly proclaim themselves to be leninists the most extreme illustration of this in my experience was the argument advanced in a conversation by a friend of mine to the effect that after all lenin himself had included representatives of other parties in the first
 the library quarterly cabinet that he formed inimediately after the october revolution all this is not to imply that the official ideology has now become easier to discard on the contrary as we have already observed this ideology is now almost automatically accepted by the young partly one would suspect because it provides the only general conceptual framework and language that young people now know but chiefly i think because of the fundamental change in meaning that after thirty years it has come to hold for them three decades ago this ideology was still rooted very largely in a distant vision of utopia which could easily be denied since it was admittedly unfulfilled but now that it has been at least partially translated into relatively stable realized institutions it has become largely indistinguishable from the diffuse ethos of a way of life in which from the very beginning of their existence the members of this generation have been inextricably absorbed while this transformation of the ideology into the reflection of an all encompassing present has undoubtedly resulted in its much wider acceptance by the young it has also made it infinitely more porous if only because it has made it far more susceptible to personal interpretation no longer resting on a discrete abstracted vision of the future now merged instead with infinitely more concrete and differentiated perceptions of the world of today the official ideology has lost thereby its ability to guard the thoughts and feelings of its keepers against the impact of their immediate experience if an observer may well come to the conclusion that differences in social origin the distinction between old and new intelligentsia rather than any distinctive characteristics of occupational roles and concerns still represent the most important dividing line that may be discerned within the ranks of the middle generation of the intelligentsia he is likely to draw a contrary impression from his contacts with the third generation the young men and women of the intelligentsia are the final products of a society whose social institutions and class lines are becoming increasingly stable and owing to the much greater continuity of life experience that this stabler society affords or imposes it is the nature of life experience and primarily the characteristic features of professional roles and pursuits that have become the chief molds in which their attitudes and values are shaped the last three decades have brought in the character of these professional roles a transformation so radical that it has been reflected ultimately in the very meaning of the word intelligentsia as late as thirty years ago the term was still predominantly applied to those selected few in society who were presumably engaged in the exploration of new ideas new forms new values and the criticism of existing ones despite a decade of soviet experience it still continued to reflect however dimly in its denotations the traditional view which had been emphasized ever since the introduction of the term in the  that membership in the circle of the elect hinged in the last analysis not on occupational criteria or even on the mastery of any particular intellectual skill but rather upon the development of a selfconscious articulated world view that could and indeed should be opposed to the unconscious conformist philistine instincts of the common herd traditionally in russian experience this
three generations of the soviet intelligentsia  function of self conscious social criticism of acting as the intelligentsia liked to conceive as the articulate conscience of the nation had been largely exercised through the medium of belleslettres and literary criticism and probably as late as the  russian writers and critics and only to a much lesser degree academicians still continued to be viewed and to view themselves as the core of the intelligentsia as the keepers of its intellectual traditions values and mores but after thirty years a radically new definition of the term officially introduced in the  has finally become dominant in general parlance the use of the term intelligentsia simply to designate all those who are engaged in occupations that require a degree of intellectual and technical skill this change in the language is of course merely a symbolic expression of a whole series of political social and cultural changes of the routinization of the once revolutionary ideology of the regime that has come with the establishment and consolidation of a new social order of the muzzling of russian writers and critics and more generally of the large scale suppression of all tendencies actually or potentially critical of official values that occurred in the  of the emergence in the wake of a sharply accelerated industrial revolution of a scientifically and technically oriented society it is in the characteristic physiognomy of the younger generation of the intelligentsia that the impact of these changes is now most faithfully reflected on the intellectual scene it is to be discerned not merely in the increased proportion of young men and women who are now engaged in scientific or technical pursuits or even in the interests and attitudes that the members of this dominant group generally display one can also observe it only too clearly in the general climate of the intellectual life of this generation if one may define the characteristic orientation of the technician as an interest in the application or implementation of general truths rather than in their discovery it is probably fair to say that such a technocratic orientation has become almost as characteristic of many of the young historians or philosophers whom one encounters on the soviet scene as it seems to be of most young scientists and technicians what are some of the typical features of the intellectual attitudes and values that the young commonly display they are a genuine desire for professional competence an urge to assimilate facts and to master the techniques required for their skilful organization and manipulation combined with a certain narrowness of outlook with the lack of any urgent desire to explore new intellectual horizons or to question basic theoretical assumptions a relatively unquestioning acceptance of what are conceived to be the basic institutions and values of the existing political and social order combined with a desire for greater security and greater material rewards an almost equally automatic acceptance of higher political authority indeed a sense of reverence toward the state and its needs combined with a deeply felt urge for autonomy in one professional role and for an insulated sector of private personal life as one goes down the list it would almost appear as if the composite portrait that emerges differs little from the picture that is often drawn today at least in fashionable circles of the quality that intellectual life has as
 the library quarterly sumed in contemporary western societies and especially in the united states under the impact of modern technology and mass communications and yet the analogy may be pushed too far even if certain universal tendencies of the modern age have been at work in russia as they have in other countries they have acquired a distinctive shape and flavor in the context of the russian cultural scene some of the differences are only of degree for example the concern of most members of the younger generation with the assimilation of facts and techniques with the mastery of everything that is encompassed within their definition of professional competenceis even more serious and more sustained while at the same time their intellectual horizon tends to be even narrower their interest in any broad ultimate questions even flabbier than is true of most of their western contemporaries i might cite the example of an extremely able and well trained young soviet logician of my acquaintance who although very well read not only in the narrow area of his specialty but also in the whole history of western epistemology from aristotle leibniz and kant to russell and whitehead is not in the least interested in the fundamental problems that obsessed these great philosophical figures in part one might account for this narrowness of intellectual interests in the light of the political controls of the corset of official orthodoxy under which this generation still has to operate but there are i think other more significant undertones to this feature of their mentality first one cannot help being struck by the degree of self consciousness that many in this generation mamifest in thinking about the presumed attributes and prerequisites of their professional roles about their skills their manners even their dress the quality of this self consciousness reminds one of certain of the attitudes that in a much earlier age in the eighteenth and at the beginning of the nineteenth century to be exact a nascent russian intelligentsia generally displayed following the first flush of westernization a similar concern with techniques with manners with forms rather than with the more distant if more basic objects of their roles a desire to be and especially to appear cultured an acute consciousness of station matched by equal uncertainty as to precisely what prerequisites this station entailed deeply felt feelings of patriotism combined with an equally vivid sense of emulation of and competition with the west in my own experience the quality of this self consciousness was most sharply evoked by an eager and well meaning young soviret curator who escorted me through the warehouse of the russian museum in leningrad in which many of the paintings in official disfavor still remain stacked eternally confronting in the shadows the numberless rows of discarded busts and paintings of the late joseph stalin as we proceeded on our tour of the warehouse pausing from time to time to look through piles of unframed canvases of russian modernistic painters ranging from early chagalls and kandinskys to the energetic products of the expressionist school of the early and middle  my guide who had conducted a westerner on such a tour only once before watched me like a hawk for the proper expressions of admiration or disdain mr alfred barr the previous western visitor had been much taken with this black on black
three generations of the soviet intelligentsia  or perhaps it was a white on white didn i find it interesting i didn and as the disparity between my uneducated taste and mr barr was gradually revealed my guide introductions to each canvas grew ever sparser and more tentative and she eagerly seized on whatever lame and uncertain clues i was able to throw her way actually of course most members of the new generation are professionally quite competent but the incident i have just cited is to some degree indicative of the solemn and almost puritanical zeal with which they are straining to master the techniques the forms the details of their professional roles now that they have been liberated or have liberated themselves in some degree from detailed official supervision but even this by no means provides the whole explanation for this generation almost obsessive concern with minutiae rather than with the broad problems of intellectual inquiry and scholarship their intense and narrow professionalism also represents i believe a genuine form of self emancipation the form that the young demand for personal autonomy has taken in the wake of the all pervasive political atmosphere and controls of the past in this respect the younger generation insistence on the sanctity of professional standards and criteria on the all importance of the mastery of facts and techniques constitutes perhaps the safest but also the most direct channel for revolt against the political hacks of the stalin era and by the same logic the latter insistence on the ultimate implications of various intellectual and professional concerns and therefore on the continued centrality of ideological norms and criteria has been their chief battle standard in the defense of their threatened stations thus in the younger generation deliberately narrow and circumscribed professionalism just as in other equally innocuous and unimpressive man ifestations of their attitudes such as the desire for a private apartment or the urge to engage with their own friends in informal leisure activities of their own choosing even if these may involve but the collection of postage stamps one may discern a general and deeply felt desire for the restoration of a measure of individual autonomy and personal privacy it is essentially this same urge that is expressed if in a more forceful and more direct fashion in the one area of the intellectual life of the younger generation in which on occasion ultimate problems of value are squarely faced and explicitly discussed namely the domain of literature and the arts literature has always been the inner fortress of the russian intelligentsia and in the contemporary works of young writers and particularly of young poets the traditional visage of the intelligentsia is even now to be discerned to be sure in the outlook of these young writers the intelligentsia traditional concern with ultimate questions and ultimate values has undergone one major perhaps startling transformation no longer is it typically expressed in the affirmation of broad generous and ambitious world views pregnant with immediate political and social implications after forty years of soviet experience it has now taken the form of a search for more modest more personal and to my mind more ultimate human values the rediscovery of truthfulness rather than the discovery of truth the defense of a code of personal dignity and personal honesty the apprehension of the beau
 the library quarterly ties of nature and of the beauties of love the determination to endure but not to compromise these are the themes that are frequently expressed in the poems many of them unpublished of the younger generation of writers and which occasionally spill through the net of official censorship in their published works of prose once again the reason for the expressly resolutely apolitical content of the preferred themes of many young soviet writers should not be hard to surmise what more direct or at least more immediate form could their revolt against the noxious all pervasive political aura that enveloped the stalin era and that still pervades so much of contemporary life possibly have assumed in the last analysis it is i think not illusory to infer that in a variety of disguises from the air of cynicism that its occasional styliagi zoot suiters proudly display like a badge of honor and the air of intense professionalism that most of its members so conspicuously manifest to the note of selfdiscovery and self affirmation that is struck in the works of some of its literateurs much of the younger generation of the intelligentsia is now earnestly engaged in an effort to defend or at least in a search to discover a private and autonomous sphere of the self what does all this portend for the future with all the urgency of their desire fot a measure of personal autonomy most of these young people it must be recalled continue to feel loyal to the foundations of their social order to socialism and its values as they variously choose to define them but lest one be tempted to draw all too sweeping predictions from this indubitable present fact one needs also to be reminded that the pattern of values and thoughts that a person consciously entertains at a particular moment does not necessarily reflect with any precision the complex and unstable balance between those elements that attract him to and those that repel him from the social order under which he lives a sense of loyalty often represents the only real alternative to the almost intolerable bitterness and loneliness of a feeling of total alienation if in the face of one consequent uncertainty a prediction still has to be ventured however lamely about the future attitudes of this generation it would be that much will depend in the last analysis on the future policies of the regime to this observer at least most members of the younger generation of the intelligentsia still appear willing to support an authoritarian political order an order under which as has been the case through most of russia history respect for higher authority would be combined with the recognition of some priority of state needs but most of these young men and women do not appear to expect of the future and perhaps many of them will not even be willing to endure the allpervasive totalitarian controls the invasion of all areas of human privacy and autonomy by the dictations of official expediency and official whims that have been characteristic of the recent past this diagnosis of their present outlook and aspirations should not lead us to feel either excessively despairing or especially self righteous authoritarianism after all can assume a variety of vestments and through most of human history it is under its restrictions that individuals have had to seek and often have managed to find a measure of inner freedom and dignity
