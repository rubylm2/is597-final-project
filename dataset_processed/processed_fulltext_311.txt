the overseas book program of the united states government dan lacy rrw x recent controversy over the state department overseas lii braries has led to the publication of a spate of information about this previously little known activity public statements congressional hearings television programs radio broadcasts and press headlines have explored with much heat and with some light almost every phase of the program in consequence to undertake a descriptive review of the libraries and their operations would be a wasteful and tedious repetition instead i should like to consider not the library program alone but the more general question of the use of books by this government as a means toward attaining its foreign objectives and to do so not descriptively but critically i should like particularly to consider certain underlying concepts inherited practices and administrative patterns which it seems to me have hampered the effectiveness of the book program and to try to suggest more productive alternatives in doing so we shall of course be discussing a program primarily in terms of its limitations and weaknesses and giving unconstrained consideration to what might be a more nearly ideal operation as we do so i hope you will not forget as i cannot that the hundreds of capable and devoted men and women who have made this program have had no such luxury of ideal choice they have had to create a reality with all the necessary imperfections of reality and to do so hurriedly in strange countries among new and demanding problems subject to inconsistent and changing administrative directions provided with few resources and harassed by ignorant attacks anyone who has been privileged as i have been to work for a time with the professional staff of the book program realizes that its success remarkable in the circumstances is the measure of their skill and devotion suffice it to say by way of description that the united states information agency as the recent inheritor of this function from the state department operates  libraries in  countries with total book holdings of over  volumes with an annual circulation of more than  and with an annual attendance of more than  it also contributes to the support of  binational cultural institutes with incidental library activities this program was built up by the state department over the years   largely from elements created by other agencies for other purposes it took over the owi libraries set up for wartime propaganda  see especially the public statement issued in mimeographed form by robert l johnson administrator of the international information administration on july   and printed in the niew york times for that date henry james jr the role of the information library in the united states international information program library quarterly xxiii april    dan lacy aid to national policy library trends ii july    in addition to the extensive press comment during the period february july   all figures are as of july  
the overseas book program  and reference purposes the amerika haeuser created by omgus as a part of the occupation program in germany the similar institutions created by the united states forces in austria the libraries operated by the army in korea the scap information centers in japan the cultural institutes created by the coordinator of inter american affairs and the libraries set up in latin america by the american library association under government contract to these it added from time to time institutions established under its own auspices in addition the usia presents about  books and periodicals a year to foreign institutions and individuals stimulates the export of american books in a variety of ways particularly through the informational media guaranty program and fosters the translation of about  books a year especially into asian tongues in which few american books are otherwise available the overseas operations administration as the heir of the technical assistance administration of the state department took over the scattered book and libraries activities carried on under that program these varied activities brought from their several origins staffs policies and operating practices as well as actual facilities developed to meet particular and diverse objectives their subsequent history has been shaped in turn by the administrative patterns the policies and the shifting emphases of the total infornation program of which they became a part governing that total program was a rather clear cut conception of the basic problems to which it was addressed at considerable risk of oversimplification one can perhaps say that those problems were seen as threefold  people abroad disliked and mistrusted the united states this could only be it was thought because they were ignorant of this country or misunderstood its aims obviously what was needed was to disseminate information about the united states in the words of the smith mundt act to present a full and fair picture this conception of the problem dominated the propaganda effort until   people abroad proved susceptible to soviet propaganda this could only be it was thought because they failed to penetrate soviet deceit the obvious remedy was to expose the falsehood of the soviet pretensions in official language to wage a campaign of truth this concept has dominated subsequent thinking about the information program  people abroad did not produce as efficiently as americans this must necessarily be in part at least it was thought because they did not know how the obvious remedy in the hackneyed phrase was to export know howto provide technical knowledge and skills it was this conception that underlay the technical assistance program now as a matter of fact all of these problems are real and important and the proposed solutions are not unrealistic but as i shall try to show hereafter so limited a conception of the problem one so exclusively concerned with symptoms rather than causes involves a vast and potentially tragic oversimplification the programs addressed to the solution of these problems have been profoundly affected not only by the accepted definition of the problems themselves but also by certain administrative contexts and certain inherited attitudes which were frequently ill adapted to the actual situation among the most important and most damaging of these circumstances has been the relatively rigid and complex administration pattern
 the library quarterly wthin which the program has operated time does not permit even a resum of the administrative history of the information program and of the place of books in it it must suffice to say that operational considerations have led to a distinct separation of the radio press films educational exchange and book programs and to a domination of both planning and execution by these media as such though this weakness had been recognized within the state department and steps have long been in process to redress it it remains the case that it is difficult to plan or to execute a project combining two or more media and especially difficult to undertake one employing techniques other than these media and for reasons that will appear such projects are essential to the best use of books perhaps even more serious has been the almost complete administrative separation of the technical assistance program from the information program in spite of the essentially inseparable character of many of their instruments and objectives recent developments have aggravated these difficulties by transferring the technical assistance program from the state department to the overseas operations administration and the book program to the united states information agency while leaving in the state department the educational exchange program with which the book program needs to be particularly intimately associated the most apparently relevant bodies of experience on which the state department could draw in developing its informational policies and strategic techniques were those of psychological warfare and of advertising the nucleus of the program staff came to the state department from the wartime activities of the owi and the most significant theoretical analysis in the field of international persuasion was developed by persons in the united states and in europe engaged in direct psychological warfare advertising commanded respect as a body of skills in stimulating people to predetermined behavior which daily proved its efficacy both these fields had much to offer in the way of directly applicable techniques but both suffered from a limitation in that they were concerned with stimulating certain specific actions within a short time span and within an established framework of ideology and social pattern which could be accepted and utilized as a part of the process of persuasion in so far as the state department information program was or ought to have been concerned with altering such basic ideological and social patterns over a long time span the techniques of psychological warfare and of advertising were in some degree irrelevant or even contradictory to take a specific case in point a psychological warfare team charged with damaging the morale of a body of german troops and encouraging their surrender could take cognizance of the authoritarian pattern of german life and utilize it by destroying confidence of the troops in their constituted leaders and substituting awe and respect for the power of the united states forces as a behavior orienting pole of authority a state department information officer in postwar germany concerned with contributing to the disruption of the authoritarian pattern itself and the encouragement of democratic social patterns faced a problem of almost infinitely greater complexity and difficulty similarly to persuade a weary and broken europe to draw its strength again together and for the third time in a generation to confront a threatened tyranny
the overseas book program  with a bold hazard of life itself and to do so under the leadership of an unfamiliar and mistrusted america this is something different from selling cigarettes by no cleverness shall we create the steadfast hope that is needed to outface the despair of this desperate age the bodies of experience on which we need to draw are perhaps those of the great teachers and the great missionaries but their skills are not ones that can be contrived to meet an occasion in drawing on familiar professional skills for its informational effort it was of course natural that the state department should also draw on familiar media and familiar patterns of their use radio networks press services illustrated news magazines and documentary film series all afforded prototypes of information service activities so did the public library whose patterns of operation governing concepts were taken over initially with relatively little critical analysis or adaptation to the special circumstances of the information program certain additional patterns were later taken over from book publishing but there was relatively little in the evolution of new techniques in the utilization of booksor for that matter of other media to meet the peculiar needs that were confronted in part because of these inheritances there was a preoccupation with quick as opposed to lasting results the owi background with its pattern of shorttern psychological warfare operations and the prestige of the so called fast media radio and press contributed to this preoccupation so did the character of day to day operations themselves which produced an almost overriding pressure to deal now with this issue now with that as they presented themselves in the daily news beyond this the sober judgment of many over the past few years has not estimated that means of peaceful persuasion had time left for any but quick effects or that any program that could look only to a distant future for its achievement would have space for function coupled with this preoccupation with speed was a similar preoccupation with a mass audience though concentration on leaders and opinion molders was a professed policy of the information program in practice it was only in grants to foreign leaders by the educational exchange service that it was actually achieved throughout the rest of the program there was a constant effort to reach the largest possible number of people and a tendency to measure the relative effectiveness of various activities by the comparative size of their audiences in part this grew from a natural assumption that instruments of persuasion should persuade broadly and from a democratic conviction that it was the grass roots opinion in foreign countries that really mattered and not that of any elite the inheritance from psychological warfare had special importance in establishing this pattern of mass appeal during the war the internal channels of communication in enemy countries were of course closed to foreign penetration if one wished to influence the hostile population he had to do so directly and through his own channels radio was the easiest means and direct mass audience broadcasts acquired a prestige that has been retained the technical assistance programn like the information program proper was shaped by factors of administrative context and inherited policies from the old interdepartmental committee on scientific and cultural cooperation it had derived a decentralized pattern that di
 the library quarterly vided the actual responsibility for operations among many agencies of the government each with a rather narrowly professional approach to its functions this pattern afforded no means for attention to higher professional and technical education or to library services and books as means of technical assistance except in their relevance to one or more specific and immediate projects moreover the state department over all responsibilities on this program prior to its transfer to the foreign operations administration were placed in the bureau of economic affairs administratively remote from the information program proper the technical assistance program was particularly penetrated with the conviction that a grass roots approach was essential medical programs for example were addressed to cleaning up specific sources of infection having a direct effect on the health of a locality rather than to building up medical schools and facilities for medical research this almost passionate insistence on the direct approach to individuals doubtless grew out of a sound conviction that economic progress in the backward areas could come only with the attainment of higher productive skills by all their people but there was an insufficient realization that the general dissemination of those skills could come only through a trained corps of experts and teachers in the country itself and that development of such a corps was usually the most urgent step toward reaching the masses these far too summarily sketched were certain of the elements of the administrative and policy context within which the book program operated elements that have in general operated to limit the program effectiveness i think that one can particularly call attention to six important weaknesses that proceeded from these causes let me here repeat that this article is by design concerned primarily with elements of weakness not of strength the evidence is abundant that the book program in spite of these weaknesses was remarkably effective and it is obvious that other elements of the administrative and policy pattern within which it operated contributed to this effectiveness one of these weaknesses was a too faithful reproduction abroad of the american public library in many ways this was good the freedom the egalitarianism the enthusiasm for service of the american public library together with many of its technical features such as open shelf collections were among the strongest assets of the american information centers overseas on the other hand the rather indiscriminate desire to please all possible users which was one of their most attractive features materially diffused their political effectiveness also a relative uniformity made adaptation to local situations difficult in near eastern or southeast asian countries in which literacy in english was very low for example a different type of institution with a greater emphasis on participating activities in the local vernaculars was perhaps more needed than a sizable library of english books only relatively late in the program did alternative means of using books receive emphasis comparable to that on the library program a second weakness has been a too exclusive and even strident emphasis on overt pro american and anti russian propaganda in the translation program and in the large scale distribution of individual titles these are the two aspects of the book program in which there is a
the overseas book program  specific selection of materials to reach a large audience analogous to the radio and press programs like those programs these book activities have been affected by the oversimple analysis of needs and the emphasis on direct approach the results have been useful but these aspects of the book program in part also because they were simply too small to do so have not really begun to deal with those central problems with respect to which they could be most useful a third weakness has been a carryover into the book program of an emphasis on mass audiences with which books were relatively ineffective it is obvious that a few small and scattered american libraries each with a collection of a few thousand books in english can have no palpable effect on the generality of a foreign population in india for example the ratio of libraries to people was as if one small town library of less than  volumes served the whole population of the united states east of the mississippi and north of the ohio in such a situation to be concerned with the relatively indiscriminate enlargement of the clientele was absurd it was obvious indeed that only the utmost concentration of effort on small trigger groups and individuals could hope to produce any perceptible effect yet statistics of attendance and circulation remained a basic criterion of effectiveness similarly the tone and level of the translation program though not its size was pitched at a mass audience rather than at the intellectual leaders who might have more effectively transmitted its content of ideas into action and into the formation of a local opinion this emphasis on a mass audience had its parallel in a neglect of indigenous channels of communication within the countries which it was sought to reach it is true that there were occasional gifts of small collections of books to libraries of foreign universities and such usis libraries as that in london did an effective job of integrating themselves with the public library systems of the countries in which they were situated but such occasional efforts were regarded as incidental to the primary programs which sought to reach the foreign audience directly through american libraries and the distribution of american publications one can see the relative result of such a technique if one imagines that for example the ideas of the great french thinkers were able to reach americans only through a few small libraries maintained in this country by the french government through the distribution of the original texts as published in france and through occasional subsidized translations rather than through their contribution to the content of american writings in their several fields a perhaps even more serious weakness was the impossibility of fusing book programs with closely related activities particularly with the work of the educational exchange service and of the technical cooperation administration if books had meaning and an effective role in international communication it was as an integral part of a total effort to achieve communication in certain broad areas of thought and technical skill and in as intimate a relation with the total process of education as books have in the formal educational system and in the general intellectual life of this country the really fruitful use of books was made most difficult by the very autonomy of the book program finally the greatest weakness of all was that the book program was always incomparably small in relation to the
 the library quarterly task it needed to do this failure to receive adequate support was in turn very closely related to the general policy context in which the program was carried on with its emphasis on those elements of immediacy and mass audience in which books compared poorly with such media as radio and the press many of the uses of books which were most important and which we shall discuss a little later were simply impossible in terms of the kind of budget that was available for the use of books particularly was this true in the technical assistance program where a gigantic world wide effort at the dissemination of technical knowledge involving the annual expenditure of dozens of millions of dollars had paradoxically made practically no provision whatever for the use of books as vehicles for that dissemination what then should have been the shape and character of the dominant policies of the book program i think that any answer to this question must begin with some broader consideration of the character of the international problems to which the informatioa activities of the united states government needed to be addressed these problems were indeed of a very different character and of almost infinitely greater complexity than had been conceived in the earlier days of the information program if i were to undertake to characterize that problem in a phrase i would describe it as the restoration of unity it is perhaps trite to point out that the world order which had held most of the nations together in a loose political and economic community under western european and american hegemony had collapsed utterly in the last quarter century this was perhaps most obviously apparent in asia here dwelt nearly half the world population bound to the rest of the human race both politically and economically by patterns of western dominance the people of asia with only occasional exceptions lived either under direct western european political control or in an uneasy and partial independence like that of china whose genuine freedom to act politically was sharply circumscribed even more closely were the people of asia bound to the western economy the direction of their economic efforts beyond subsistence agriculture was determined by the needs of western markets western capital owned and western management directed their limited industries these nations moreover had their being in a world in which the patterns of effective political and economic organization were western patterns founded on a western technology which grew from a science and ultimately from a metaphysics peculiarly western a people not equipped with mastery of these underlying bodies of knowledge was incapable of functioning with genuine independence whatever its formal political status during the course of the second world war and the immediately succeeding years these patterns of western political and economic control simply disintegrated for a variety of reasons unnecessary to recount here great nations with tens and hundreds of millions of people such as india pakistan burma the philippines and indonesia achieved their political freedom others such as china burst loose from the pattern of western european influence and became indeed under russian tutelage violently hostile to that influence an accompaniment of this political development was the expropriation of western capital and the seizure of the managment of western enterprises as in the case of british in
the overseas book program  vestments in iranian oil or the dutch investments in indonesian plantation agriculture or the british and american investments in the economy of china the result has too often been a chaos m which an anachronistic relationship of metropolis to colony has justly disappeared but has not yet been replaced by a relation of equality the creation of a world order reuniting asia and the west this time on terms of voluntary participation is perhaps the great imperative of contemporary statesmanship the alternative is a hastening chaos and the probable absorption of the asian powers into an order in which communist totalitarianism provides the unifying ideas but the creation of a voluntary world order requires the genuine willingness and further the genuine ability of the asian nations to participate as equals in that order this means the sort of understanding of western civilization and its purposes that will inspire confidence it requires moreover a degree of mastery of western sciences and of western economic and political organization that will enable the asian powers to sustain an effectively functioning independent sovereignty in most of the western european countries as well the dominant characteristic of the postwar years has been the weakness of unifying concepts and the consequent inability to sustain a united political course hardly one of the major western powers has been able to achieve a stable internal political settlement in which the major elements of its population could confidently unite not since the early postwar years has either political party in great britain been able to maintain a dominant majority the internal disunity in france has produced repeated cabinet crises approaching anarchy in italy the current regime has no assured margin of support it is noteworthy that even in the united states though the national administration won a decisive victory in the  election the parties are divided with almost precise equality in the congress and there is every indication that as the eisenhower administration gives concrete reality to its program the apparent nearunanimity of support which it enjoyed in the first session of congress will prove to have been illusory and to have concealed a wide and very nearly irreconcilable divergence of opinion on specific issues even in the face of a soviet menace so capable of overwhelming and indeed obliterating western european civilization it has been impossible to achieve a truly effective unity of action in the free world it is not i think an oversimplification to say that the restoration to the free world of the ability to act with unity or purpose is the test by which our civilization will stand or fall one may say that this restoration of unity in turn requires three things first it requires the possession of common attitudes this was relatively easy when the world was dominated by a few western powers with a common cultural history a common philosophy a common religion a common set in other worlds of orienting beliefs and when within each of those western states actual political power tended to be concentrated within a relatively small class with an even higher degree of homogeneity of purpose as the broadening and deepening of the free world has vastly broadened the circle of those whose independent and voluntary assent must be given to fundamental political and economic decisions the attainment of unity of purpose has become correspondingly more difficult it is not now merely a matter of great britain and the united
 the library quarterly states or of france and belgium or of italy and spain being able to act in concert it is a matter of the united states and thailand of germany and india of great britain and egypt and within each of those powers a unity of political action now requires the voluntary participation not of thousands but of millions of persons speaking in global terms of hundreds of millions of the most diverse cultural backgrounds the most varied beliefs the most conflicting economic interests and yet without the creation of a solid basis of common attitudes and common values it is difficult to see how any community of purpose and action can be achieved in the second place unity of action requires a common appreciation of what is going on contemporarily in the world one must not only approach the day news with a certain set of common attitudes the news itself must be communicated in relatively common terms by news i mean here of course not alone day to day flow of headlines but the whole flow of contemporary history and the whole conceptual character of the contemporary world there can be no question that an underlying cause for example of the whole iranian oil economy was the simple ignorance of the world oil economy under which the iranian leaders suffered similarly even though indians and americans have a strikingly similar humanitarian regard for human life it is difficult for them to act in concert if they receive diametrically opposed pictures with regard to the charges of germ warfare in korea the achieving of any common and realistic understanding of contemporary events is of course made enormously more difficult by the internal and international tensions which distort reality at every turn the third requirement for unity of action among the free nations is the ability of the less advanced nations to participate effectively and freely in the world economy an equality which in turn requires a gigantic and swift advance in the level of scientific and technical knowledge in the social and political as well as in the natural sciences in those countries it requires something far vaster than any point four program of which we have yet conceived these are enormous demands but they are inescapable the only alternative to a free order is a totalitarian order and the only basis of a free order is a community of knowledge and purpose to meet these demands requires a very complex and extensive communication between cultures of precisely the sort of which books are an essential component it is to the needs of that level and kind of communication that we should look in endeavoring to formulate the principal characteristics needed in the book program in the first place the book program must be very much larger the current level of expenditure is trifling in the face of the most gigantic and difficult task of conveying ideas and knowledge that history has ever encountered administratively it is essential that the use of books be intimately associated with the educaiional exchange service and with the technical assistance program its isolation from these two programs is a major obstacle to the possible success of all three assuming adequate support and appropriate administrative context the book program will need always to retain and somewhat though not greatly to expand the network of usis libraries utilizing them principally as high level reference centers staffed by professional american employees and intended pri
the overseas book program  marily to serve those who have important roles in the making of decisions or the dissemination of ideas the need for institutions to afford general opportunities for face to face contact with local citizens should be met by more informal means but the primary expansion of the book program should take place outside present institutional patterns such an expansion should distinguish clearly between those activities aimed at conveying knowledge and ideas to other countnres and those aimed at disseminating them within those countries book activities intended to bring information to another country must be aimed at those persons most apt as receptors books will of course be one of the instruments used directly by the mission staff in its direct dealings with those like government officials who can apply information from abroad directly in their daily activities but in so far as the communication process is directed toward a general and enduring effect upon general attitudes the most effective receptors are professional intellectuals they are the ones with a sufficient interest in foreign ideas and books the ones most competent to transmute and interpret ideas and knowledge to meet local needs and the ones best situated to introduce novel elements into the general intellectual patterns of their countries two sorts of things need to be done to reach these groups one is a far larger program than any heretofore attempted aimed at building up the holdings of american and other useful books in the libraries of the institutions in which they work in western europe this would consist largely in aid to the principal national and university libraries in their presently quite inadequate acquisitions of american books and journals a relatively simple and a relatively inexpensive operation but one inescapably necessary at a time when not even the british museum can afford dollars for the comprehensive purchase of serious contemporary american works in asia and the middle east such a program would be more difficult but it offers incalculable rewards here a whole new generation of leaders is being trained in a few universities whose inadequacies are in part compensated for by their nationalistic fervor they are the centers of the national awakening in those countries in the nearly total absence of trained leaders their present students will quickly come to dominant positions in the technology the economy and the government of their country the thirst for western competence in these universities is matched only by the hatred of western dominance and the ill informed suspicion of western motives the impress here made on the students of the next decade may well be a decisive influence on the history of a continent in many countries of this area pakistan india ceylon burma malaya and the philippines for example english is the normally used language of higher instruction and it is generally read with ease by advanced university students throughout the area at the same time the present poverty of the libraries of the region assures that american books would receive immediate and intensive use just as the rapidly growing programs of asian studies in many american universities are helping thousands of students to be able to see the world through asian eyes an adequate program of presentation of american books to asian and a more extended discussion of the complex question of the proper role of the libraries as specific part of the book program is contained in my article aid to national policy library trends ii july  esp  
 the library quarterly middle eastern universities could help this whole new generation of leaders to a fuller knowledge and appreciation of western values and attitudes a more accurate knowledge of the west and the competence in western skills essential to economic sovereignty this needs to be done however with intelligence and care indiscriminate gifts will be wasted and resented gifts of books unrelated to a larger purpose will generally be useless every gift of books should be part of a specific undertaking to create for example or to strengthen a medical school at one university to create an advanced department of economics at another to establish an institute of international relations at a third to strengthen the research resources of a miniistry of agriculture each such undertaking should be sought by and in significant part supported by local authorities it should include the necessary loans and exchanges of professors research personnel and advanced students the provision of adequate quarters and facilities and the presentation of laboratory and other scientific equipment as well as books all undertaken as a single integrated project moreover and of the utmost importance the whole administration of such a project and particularly the selection of books must be with a single eye to its professional success the intrusion of irrelevant political considerations eg the screening of books to be presented to an indian medical school to aid let us say its work in epidemiology with a view to eliminating any by authors with a prior record of listed organizational affiliations would be fatal to the ultimate political objectives of the program so far the only funds available for even the limited pursuit of such a program derive from the acts applying finnish war debt payments and a part of the interest payments on the recent indian wheat loan to cultural exchanges with those countries these have been too small to have a major effect and their administration has been seriously in the case of india almost fatally up to the present hampered by division of authority and by the administrative difficulty in fusing a program embodying both books and professional exchanges but they offer an opportunity under imaginative administration to indicate what could be done the other major use of books as a means of approach to foreign intellectuals should be as one element in a variety of projects in which american and foreign intellectual leaders can jointly participate the possibilities of a sufficiently flexible and imaginative program of this sort are so many and diverse that they can be only suggested here hitherto work with foreign intellectual leaders has involved only bringing them here for a hurried three month tour paying travel costs for them to assume visiting professorships here and sending american professors abroad to lecture most of these activities have been carried on under the fulbright program and the fear that that program might be prostituted to narrowly political ends led to its being hedged with legislative restrictions which make difficult its use for many broader ends among the things which ought to be done are the following  holding a number of conferences like the colloquium on islamic civilization so successfully sponsored by the library of congress and princeton university with state department support conferences on hindu and on buddhist cultures are natural successors  making grants to american learned societies in such fields as philosophy his
the overseas book program  tory political science and economics to enable them to carry on a variety of activities with their professional associates abroad one can conceive for example of the american political science association being host to an informal but high level conference on such a subject as the forms of international organization of the free world or the american economics association similarly sponsoring a conference on the economics of national development or the techniques of economic analysis developed over the last ten or fifteen years such conferences would afford an opportunity for selected foreign leaders to work congenially and entirely free from government control in assocation with their colleagues from the free world in trying to develop common points of view on the crucial issues of that world the multiplying effect of the ideas engendered there and disseminated at home would be out of all proportion to cost such societies ought also to be aided in distributing their journals abroad without charge to a select list of their choosing and to aid foreign scholars in the acquisition of significant american books in their fields  the sponsoring of institutes like that at salzburg in foreign universities as a means of assuring the continuing association of intellectual leaders from many free countries in the consideration of the major common problems of free society these are but three possibilities out of many the point is to utilize the existing scholarly organizations taking advantage of their own imaginative approaches and aiding rather than dictating their efforts toward creating common understanding in the areas of their respective disciplines in all these the use of books is an imdispensable auxiliary whose exact character will be determined by the circumstance in each case in western europe and the more advanced countries of latin america such endeavors to convey ideas to a small seminal group should definitely take precedence over activities aimed at reaching the general population directly with american books the internal means of disseminating throughout those countries ideas formulated or received in their intellectual groups are excellent and far more eff ective than any direct means it is not only that frenchmen will of course always rely on french authors french books french libraries rather than on american or other importations it is that an imported idea can become effective only after it has found its place in the whole fabric of thought of the country to which it comes an american idea will have force in france only as it becomes a french idea fully incorporated in a french system of thought the idea of passive resistance through civil disobedience could never have reached the people of india directly through the writings of thoreau it was meaningful to them only as embodied along with ideas from many other sources in the philosophy of gandhi in the less advanced areas however especially in asia and the near east aid in developing the means of disseminating ideas within those countries is needed this involves two general areas of operation technical assistance to libraries and the development of facilities for publishing and distributing both translations and original works under the various exchange of persons programs a number of foreign librarians have been brought to the united states for experience or training and a number of american librarians have been sent abroad to teach or conduct
 the library quarterly demonstration projects and the usis libranans overseas have frequently been able to be helpful to their professional colleagues in meeting technical problems but nothing done to date has been on such a scale as to have meaningful results technical assistance and material aid to university libraries and to the research libraries of government ministries in the middle east and asia are essential if they are to be effective in the exploitation of their holdings and are being given by unesco in such countries as iran this ought to be one of the basic components in the american technical assistance program similar efforts at the present development in asian countries of a public library system on the american pattern seem to me however premature i think there is neither the economic base the volume of material nor the literate clientele that could yet support such a system what is needed first is a network of fundamental education centers with limited holdings of simple vernacular reading materials with a few public libraries in the major cities capable of serving as the nuclei of a later general system perhaps even more essential is aid in the development of a publishing and book distribution system capable of meeting the internal needs of middle eastern and asian countries there is simply not the means in terms of either editorial and translating staff printing plants or distribution systems to produce more than a trickle of books in the vernacular languages the appalling significance of this can hardly be stated for the half or more of the world people imprisoned in tongues in which almost no part of the whole body of modern knowledge has appeared little beginnings have been made franklin publications inc brings some of the best skills in the american publishing world to the production of arabic books and may extend its activities to other eastern countries the burmese translation society has been aided in acquiring a modern printing plant the translation program of usis has given help to many publishers abroad seeking to bring out translations of useful american books but again nothing has yet been of a magnitude capable of changing the situation fundamentally here is one of the most challenging of all fields for statesmanship and professional skill in trying to suggest some of the variety of ways in which it seems to me books and book skills ought to be used abroad by our government i am less concerned about this or that particular project than about two fundamental imperatives one is that the book program ought not to be bound by a slavish reproduction of methods and institutions we use at home or by inherited and it seems to me often mistaken policy concepts derived from irrelevant circumstances it ought to be based on the broadest and most thoughtful appraisal of need on the freest and most flexible association with other activities and on the fullest awareness of the rich and varied competences of books as instruments of extended and significant discourse the other imperative is that the book program like all our international information activities should grow from a modest sense of our own part in a united free world it is not so important to the preservation of the free world we inhabit that the ideas that unite it be american ideas as that they be valid ideas indeed to the extent that ideas are peculiarly american they are the less competent to serve as the basis of that unity of purpose which is our first need the peculiar vir
the overseas book program  tues of books are ineffective in contrived propaganda the freest of the vehicles of human thought they achieve their potency in the free and earnest exchange of ideas the whole underlying purpose of a sound book program should be to contribute to the means by which all the free peoples may be associated in beliefs to which they can all give assent to create and maintain such a book program will of course require responsible executive support capable of sustaining those who administer it under the sort of uninformed and irresponsible criticism that has always plagued our overseas information effort if the united states is going to make any mature and meaningful contributions to the unity of the free world purposes it must as the simplest beginning show a sense of mature and responsible purpose in its own informational efforts and those efforts must continue for good or ill foreign policy cannot today free itself from the responsibilities of public persuasion as i tried to say in another place the difficulty in obtaining ratification of the european defense community treaty by the very european powers which had planned and drawn it a difficulty which threatened the whole basis of american foreign policy in europe showed with painful clarity how fruitless is an agreement between governments to which their respective peoples have not been persuaded it was also clear that no day to day efforts at producing conviction could be successful unless they could rely on the existence of a substratum of common understanding and values the achievement of this in turn could be hoped for only from a program which sought not to manipulate the minds of friendly nations toward american ends but which out of a decent respect to the opinions of mankind aimed to hold clearly before the world principles of universal validity deserving the assent of other nations and their full association in seeking common goals the truths on which such a structure of universal belief and purpose could be erected were no longer so few or so self evident as they were in  and successful persuasion of lasting kind today required extensive and candid communication between peoples on very complex questions of ideology it was also obvious that books were one of the few competent vehicles for this necessary commerce of ideas and that any successful program would require their wise and skillful use ibid p
