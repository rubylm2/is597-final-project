the belief that it is essential to help all individuals who enter the library by providing materials and services that reflect the diverse range of perspectives and groups in society has been the underlying foundation to the code of ethics and the bill of rights of the american library association  there are various library services tailored to specific populationsyoung adults children older adults immigrants nonenglish speakers persons with disabilities and people with literacy challenges among others these services targeted to specific populations have been formulated and offered by libraries based on the current needs of society for example in the early s public librarians in new york city held special language programs for the flood of new immigrants to the country most of whom did not speak english fluently  during the present economic downturn public libraries have engaged in a wide range of programs and activities to provide access to and assistance in searching for jobs seeking social services locating housing and applying for government benefits   this professional commitment to serving diverse patron communities however has never translated into widespread advancement of research in diversity related areas in library and information science lis or increased offerings of diversity courses in lis programs recent research in lis has provided a proliferation of evidence that has highlighted the vital needs of diversity related research and course offerings in lis  and the importance of creating a model for building and sustaining diversity in lis   consider one element of diversity that has always been the focus of politics and socioeconomic discussion in the united statesracial diversity from  to   percent of population growth in the united states was nonwhite  half of the population  and younger is nonwhite and minority births now account for  percent of children born   for example the hispanic population increased by  million between  and  accounting for over half of the  million increase in the total population between  and  the hispanic population grew by  percent which was four times the growth in the total population at  percent  the asian population is also growing at a similar rate  by  minorities are projected to comprise  percent of the us population   many places are already majority minority meaning that the majority of the population is nonwhite of the  counties in the united states nearly one in tenare already majority minority   in addition in one of every four counties there are more minority children than white children   libraries and other information organizations either are currently or will be serving an ever more racially diverse national population the nation is becoming more diverse but lis is not embracing this change in its research particularly in research that will support libraries in providing services resources programs and outreach that will meet the needs of these diverse communities and patron populations the example of the changing of racial demographics is only one of many elements of diversity that lis research must be paying attention to the population of low socioeconomic status serves as an excellent example of the neglect of another population in terms of research the economic downturn has simultaneously further increased usage and further diversified library demographics to include people with a lower socioeconomic background as many people who had not previously used the library may need to begin using it public libraries have been serving as americas first responders to the economic crisis  np and are developing many innovative ways to provide information and social services to patrons in response to the crisis   however library research remains primarily disconnected from these efforts with some researchers even objecting to focusing on the information needs of the socioeconomically disadvantaged  in order to support the realities of practice library research needs to better address key diversity related research questions how do library services accommodate this diverse national population what type of training should lis provide to future librarians what type of resources and programs should this diverse population have access to as mentioned earlier diversity related research remains scarce in the lis scholarly world clearly with the change in demographics and diversity in the united states research geared toward enhancing service to diverse populations can provide essential support to library practices we begin the exploration into diversity related research by examining an important aspect of research and education within the field of lis diversity related dissertations published between  and  almost similar to the time range used in us census data this article reports the findings of a study exploring the nature and extent of research on diversity in lis doctoral dissertations from  to  by systematically examining the last decade of dissertations in the field this study is meant to reveal the levels of interest in diversity research among doctoral students in lis and the types of diversity topics and contexts being addressed by scholars who will represent the next generation of lis scholars and educators the level of focus on diversity by the next generation of scholars will heavily shape the amount of support library research can provide library resources programs services and outreach in supporting ever more diverse service populations examining these dissertations serves to  determine whether scarcity of diversity related research in publications is also evident in dissertation studies  reveal areas of diversity that need more research focus to support practice as these new scholars add their voices to the lis discourse and  suggest future directions that diversity research may support library practice we begin by discussing our definition of diversity in lis proceed to presenting the details of the study and then conclude with the implication of the findings to practice diversity in lis research racial diversity has traditionally received the most focus in lis literature related to diversity in preparation to work with diverse populations initiatives to diversify the profession and research eg  however lis as a profession cannot limit itself to research on inclusion based on race and ethnicity or even based on populations protected from legal discrimination   lis professionals facilitate access to information must be prepared to work with the information needs and information behavior of diverse populations and must understand the needs of individuals based on the complexities of political socioeconomic and technological divides with these considerations in mind lis research needs to expand its focus from diversity in terms of simple demographics to a focus on diversity as the populations that are underrepresented disadvantaged and underserved in terms of information  having limited or no access to the internet serves as a social and learning disadvantage in terms of education civic participation employment and other major life functions to many who come from families that are in poverty    these issues are more critical in lis than almost any other field as graduates of lis programs and lis practitioners work with diverse service populations every day the definition of diversity research must encompass populations that have been marginalized in relation to information needs and information behavior as well as populations that are traditionally underrepresented in the lis professions we define diversity in lis as elements that touch on populations that are legally protected such as race ethnicity gender and disability as well as populations with access challenges related to literacy poverty culture religion migration status language sexual orientation and age among others  these expanded definitions need to be interwoven into research and teaching in lis as they are already part of the realities of librarianship within every social group there are numerous issues that can be explored including information needs and expectations the trust of information and social institutions that provide information norms and behaviors about information and the attitudes toward information sources services and types of access issues of information related to underrepresented disadvantaged and underserved populations are so prevalent that they can seamlessly fit into the work of any lis scholar either as a specific focus or as an aspect of an area of research  the field of lis is imbued with topics of diversity representation and inclusion related to libraries and other cultural institutions the issue is that lis scholars often do not pursue these research opportunities perhaps because they do not see the importance of such research to the profession at large research also informs teaching which translates into offerings of diversity related courses in lis programs faculty who conduct research in diversity may be inclined to offer diversity related courses at their institutions the scarcity of research in diversity may have a negative impact on the offerings of diversity courses in lis programs  only  percent of recent lis graduates had the option to take a course related to diversity in their degree program and only  percent of lis graduates indicated that they were prepared by their masters in library and information science mls program to work with diverse populations   among i schools a group of schools that produce a large number of doctoral students that become faculty in lis schools see httpwwwischoolsorg very few courses in mls and doctoral programs have a stated diversity component in the course description of those that do the clear majority of these courses are electives  consistent exposure to diversity issues stands as a key means through which students in lis programs can become ready to provide inclusive information services to the wide range of patrons they will encounter in their professional lives   and clearly this is not evident in the current course offerings description above diversity course offerings can be extended by recruiting doctoral students who intend to include diversity as a core pillar of their research and teaching interests to become future faculty at lis schools one key to changing the lis curriculum to incorporate diversity and offering of courses that embed diversity is to encourage future faculty doctoral students to conduct dissertation research in diversity related areas who could inform practice and create many further contributions to the understanding of the roles of information in society resulting in the profession providing better service to society to gauge the diversity research pursued by lis doctoral students we formulated a study to examine the coverage and emphasis on diversity in lis dissertation studies lis doctoral dissertations and diversity this study was conducted to determine the nature and extent of inclusion of diversity related elements in dissertation studies completed at alaaccredited lis schools between  and  the nature and extent of inclusion of diversity related elements were determined based on the elements of diversity examined populations such as ethnic populations older adults that were studied the venue such as libraries museums of these studies and the rationale of studying the selected diversity issues or problems abstracts classified as library science and information science for dissertations completed between january  and december  were retrieved from the proquest dissertations and thesis database these abstracts were then sorted to ensure that all were limited to phd dissertations completed at lis schools accredited by ala this also served to eliminate dissertations from other fields that used those classifiers these efforts yielded  lis dissertations from the period of ten years which were collected in the database to analyze the dissertation abstracts a codebook of diversity terms was generated based on the terminology used in lis discourses and diversity research across fields to ensure intercoder reliability we did a preliminary analysis by using the list of terms in this codebook as a framework to analyze a small subset of these dissertations and also sought to identify additional diversity related terms from the dissertation abstracts themselves we gathered and discussed results from this preliminary analysis and updated the codebook which included forty four diversity related phrasesterms using the codebook we conducted a content analysis on the  dissertation abstracts to identify diversity related dissertations and determine the nature and extent of inclusion of diversity related elements in these dissertations the study determined that of the  lis dissertations published during the period under study eighty nine  percent were diversity related this number was very robust given the overall lack of emphasis on diversity in lis education and research as discussed previously these eighty nine dissertations were written at thirty one different institutions which represent  percent of the phd granting ala accredited lis programs among these thirty one schools nineteen produced one or two diversity related dissertations in the ten year period as can be seen in table  researchers from six schools were responsible for producing forty two of the eighty nine diversity related dissertations representing nearly half  percent of the dissertations these leading schools primarily parallel the lis programs that graduate the most students from racial minorities  table   schools

university of new jersey   university of pittsburgh   university of texas at austin   university of california los angeles   there is also an increase in the number of diversity related dissertations published by lis schools primarily in the last two years included in this studyyears  and  as seen in table  although it may be too soon to assume that more dissertation researchers are incorporating diversity elements in recent years this increase may be pointing toward a potential positive trend of including diversity elements at the dissertation level table   number of lis diversity related dissertations by publication year year no of diversity related dissertations                                elements or issues of diversity in the dissertations include a wide range of aspects both visible and invisible  visible elements are those related to age race gender physical disabilities and others  invisible elements include but are not limited to language proficiency sexual orientation place of origin religious and moral and political values and beliefs  for this study we used the codebook based on forty four elements of diversity to analyze the eighty nine lis dissertation abstracts the analysis identified  occurrences of elements of diversity which represent fifty three distinctive elements including thirty eight of the original forty four elements in the codebook three elements that emerged from the data and twelve subcategories also identified from the data classified under the other groups or places of origin category see the appendix for the complete list of elements the  elements were ranked based on the rate of occurrences as seen in table  table   ten most used elements of diversity in lis dissertations no elements of diversity occurrences   gender

coding they were distributed and grouped based on similarities and close relationships to major categories or dimensions of diversity ten dimensions of diversity resulted from this analysis including age or age groups disability or accessibility issues discrimination andor related issues diversity andor multiculturalism ethnicity place of origin andor ethnical groups gender language andor related

table  shows the dissertations studied issues of diversity in terms of a range of venues the most and third most frequent venues were a specific physical location  percent or digital location  percent given the strong linkages between lis and spaces that provide access to informationlibraries schools archives museums websites and so onit is logical that specific physical and digital locations would be primary venues for these diversity studies similarly the remaining categories of venues are reasonable spaces to explore diversity within the context of information there were also dissertations either that did not specify a venue or that had abstracts that made it evident that data were collected without the use of a physical or digital location  percent for example some abstracts stated that data were collected through interviews a data collection method but did not indicate where the interviews were conducted and the contexts of the study table   venues in which lis dissertations

networks hivaids help networks   the dissertation abstracts were also examined in terms of whether diversity was the primary or secondary emphasis of the study this distinction hinges on the degree to which the use of diversity elements was central to a particular study if the focus on a diverse population was central to the dissertation it was classified as primary examples of this included a focus on information needs of a specific population outreach to a specific population or materials designed for a specific population in  percent n   of the dissertations diversity was the primary focus in contrast dissertations were labeled secondary if the study was focused on a diversity related context with the diverse population serving as the element by which to examine that context in the remaining  percent n   of dissertations diversity was identified as a secondary component of the research in many such studies the diverse populations were a small part of a larger studyoften one population of severalsuch as a study of the availability of home health care information to several different populations one of which is persons with disabilities examples of the contrast between dissertations labeled primary and secondary can be seen in two dissertation studies in which information related to american indians was a component in the dissertation study where information related to american indians was the primary component the study examined an academic system created specifically for american indians the problem of the information needs of american indians within this academic context is the reason for the study in another dissertation study information related to american indians was a secondary component the focus of this study was on school librarians knowledge about childrens literature related to american indians in this latter case the reason for the study was the knowledge of the school librarians with literature related to american indians serving as a measure of this knowledge finally the issues behind investigationin relation to either the grouppopulation or external issues affecting the grouppopulationwere extracted from the abstracts as indicated in table  the most common foci of the dissertations in which diversity was the primary component were impacts of diversity on information behavior  percent portrayals of diverse populations  percent information literacy in diverse populations  percent and access to information for diverse populations  percent table   reasons for studying diversity where diversity was primary component of dissertation reason diversity as primary component occurrence  impact of group membership on information behavior   portrayals in published materials library collections or other information resources   information literacy andor digital skills   availability of information access and services   construction of group identity or construction of perceptions of other groups   lis professional issues   in the dissertations where diversity was a secondary component the reasons for studying diversity were significantly different noting the most frequently occurring categories see table  illustrates these differences for example presentation or management of information was the reason for eleven  percent of the dissertations with abstracts that indicated diversity as having a secondary role in the research these dissertations often used a diverse population as a way of testing a technology rather than assessing how useful the technology was to the diverse population the second and third most frequently occurring reasons for conducting research examining diversity in ways that emphasized issues related to diversity as opposed to individuals or populations were information literacy  percent and the availability of information resources and services  percent table   reasons for studying diversity where diversity was secondary component of dissertation reason diversity as secondary component occurrence  presentation or management of information   information literacy andor digital skills   availability of information access and services   lis professional issues   impact of group membership on information behavior   translating dissertation research into sustained diversity research to support practice overall analyzing the dissertation abstracts in this way provides several important insights into diversity research and the potential of future diversity research to support library services and resources that support diverse user populations  using the expanded definition of diversity proposed earlier in this article many dissertations  percent of the  lis dissertations published in lis have a diversity component  there was an increase in the number of diversity related dissertations published by lis schools primarily in the last two years included in this studyyears  and   a number of diversity dissertations focused primarily on traditional elements of diversity noted in previous studies such as race gender and ethnicity eg minorities people of color an encouraging finding is that dimensions of diversity such as age and language were also included in a significant number of the dissertation abstracts indicating that doctoral researchers have begun broaden their understanding of what comprises diversity  diversity dissertation venues primarily centered around physical space digital spaces and educational spaces  percent of the dissertations  dissertations with diversity as their primary research focus were devoted mainly to issues about specific diverse populations  dissertations with diversity as a secondary research focus were devoted mainly to external issues affecting particular populations this studys findings suggest opportunities for further studies on how the findings from the analysis of diversity dissertations completed in ala accredited schools can be translated into further strengthening a diversity research agenda in lis scholarship that can support libraries in providing services resources programs and outreach that will meet the needs of diverse communities and patron populations there are four trends identified through this dissertation analysis that need to be considered in working toward a sustained research agenda for lis to support library practices in meeting the needs an expectations of diverse populations  there is a disconnect between diversity research that is being done in the lis generally and diversity related dissertations completed in lis schools even when the broader definition of diversity is used diversity related scholarly research in the field is surprisingly limited however using the same definition to analyze dissertation abstracts completed in the last ten years offers a different result of the  lis dissertation abstracts analyzed eighty nine  percent described studies that embraced this broader definition of diversity there also seems to be an upward trend in embracing diversity related research at the dissertation level with thirty two  percent diversity related dissertations published in the last two years  authors of diversity related dissertations seem genuinely interested in meeting the information needs of diverse populations many of the dissertation authors  percent focused their study on diversity because of genuine issuesproblems about the groupspopulations themselves and on external issues affecting these groups there was less focus on using diverse populations as a way of presenting and managing information based on this analysis we infer that most diversity dissertation research was undertaken because the authors were genuinely interested in diversity and scholarly work in relation to diversity and not merely including diversity as a component in their research for the sake of inclusion and diversity  traditional definitions of diversity guide most dissertations diversity dissertations are primarily still focused on ethnicity gender race and age  percent from a total of  diversity elements this is indeed very similar to the traditional focus on diversity research as discussed in the beginning of the article whereby race ethnicity and populations protected from legal discrimination such as gender are the core focus of the scholarly diversity study this seems to be still the trend in lis research but will need to be changed as practitioners have certainly moved beyond these legally protected populations  to respond to the needs of practice lis researchers and doctoral students must make this move and extend their focus on diversity to address the multitude of issues related to populations that are underrepresented disadvantaged and underserved in terms of information paul jaeger john bertot and renee franklin present multiple ways to identify research opportunities related to diversity and underrepresented populations   outreach beyond library spaces is not central to most of the dissertations diversity dissertations venue primarily centered on physical space digital spaces and educational spaces  percent of the diversity dissertations very few dissertation studies seem to extend beyond physical and digital spaces of libraries such as conducting studies at venues that service specific cultural communities and their information needs such as church prison and homeless shelters however some lis scholarly research has investigated venues that move beyond the traditional definition of venues in lis   more research needs to be done to examine the importance of extending the traditional definition of venues in dissertation studies and its implication to practice understanding the types of diversity research being conducted by the rising generation of scholars helps identify new areas being addressed in diversity research potential future trends in diversity research and opportunities for future research that need more exploration most importantly for practice it reveals the interests of scholars who will be shaping lis research in the coming years that will support libraries in serving diverse populations as the demographics make abundantly clear libraries must meet the information needs of continually more diverse service populations and communities the services programs outreach and resources implemented to meet these needs will be more successful when grounded in and supported by research diversity research in lis can help libraries and other information institutions remain relevant to changing service populations if libraries are not providing the resources programs and materials that various diverse populations expect they may well view the library as being of decreasing value libraries have long adapted to meet the changing needs and expectations of patrons the present and foreseeable future will be defined by an ever more diverse population of library users and libraries must adapt to these demographic changes to remain a vital social institution that meets the needs of all members of the community as librarianship has long struggled with the representation of diverse populations within its own professional and academic ranks adapting research to better support practice in this context may be challenging due to both the limited diversity within lis and the lack of a strong emphasis on diversity in research the dissertations from the previous decade of lis research however provide a considerable amount of hope that the rising generation of lis scholars will be more attuned to conducting research that will provide insights into improving library services resources programs and outreach for diverse populations in the long run libraries better attuned to the needs of diverse populations also raise the prospect of people from a greater range of populations being drawn to librarianship as a profession the rising generation of lis scholars also has the potential to broaden the focus on diversity related research to support inclusive practice scholars more focused on diversity will be more inclined to develop and teach diversity related courses at their institutions that will prepare future professionals to provide inclusive practice and also mentor new doctoral students to include diversity concepts in their research the ability of this rising generation of scholars to translate their greater focus on diversity into research that supports inclusive library practices depends heavily on the support these scholars receive in their work from senior faculty and administrators lis journals and funding agencies without encouragement and supportor worse with discouragement and rejectionthis generation of scholars could be driven away from a focus on increasing diversity research in lis to ensure that libraries can continue to serve as vital community institutions that meet the needs of all of their patrons support for diversity related research is very necessary libraries need research that will support inclusive practice with increasingly diverse populations and communities and as the dissertations of the rising generation of lis scholars demonstrate lis research can rise to this challenge if the field commits to sustaining this vital area of research
