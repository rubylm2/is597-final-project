binding practice as related to the preservation of books harold w tribolet it has been reported that the work assignments in the western european monasteries before the age of printing were very simple if a monk could read and write or possibly just write he was developed as a calligrapher those who did not have writing skills were sent to the garden or were taught bookbinding this story was probably related by a waggish calligrapher nevertheless the work of the early binder is truly remarkable he conceived sound constructional techniques some of which have survived for  years unmistakable evidence of his fundamentals and ingenuity remains in much of our binding technology of today particularly in books with rigid covers as in the past we continue to secure and hinge the leaves at one edge a process which enables one to read from one page of text to another in a convenient rapid manner many books have a concave fore edge together with a rounded backbone again a reflection of early construction the fiber boards on the sides of a modern binding inspired by the wooden panels used in the past give protective support to the less rigid leaves of the book finally although the covering material on the exterior of most of the present day machine made books is unlike the leathers used several hundred years ago its prime purpose remains to protect the underlying construction shortly after the invention of the printing press book production grew rapidly in europe the binders unlike the newly trained compositors and pressmen were not required to master a new craft for they simply continued the time consuming traditional techniques developed earlier for the binding of manuscript leaves as the demand for printed books increased it is apparent that the quality of binding suffered because inexperienced help with questionable talent was recruited to supplement the output of the skilled binders shortcuts followed and by the eighteenth century one can see evidence of these in the construction and materials used for binding the evolution of the mass produced binding to its presentday form reflects the continuing struggle of the binder to keep pace with the printing press and the demands of the publishers perhaps the most significant breakthrough came with the creation of the case binding estimated to have occurred about   shortly after the introduction of cloth for a covering material case binding illustrated the prefabrication concept it involved a group of sewn signatures glued rounded and backed to be put in a cover or case made of two boards and a covering material produced as a separate unitboth held together with an adhesive although this binding was designed to be produced by hand it was actually the prototype for the machine made binding introduced shortly before the turn of this century it was a departure from the costly hand binding of the past now books could be made available to the millions who wanted them at reasonable prices the binder in collaboration with the engineer had learned 
binding as related to preservation  to accept the tools and conditions of an industrial society but the basic fashion of binding was not changed many evolutionary variants in binding styles have developed during the past several centuries yet as klinefelter reminds us if christopher columbus were to return to earth today one of the things in daily use that he would easily recognize would be a book  p v the structural success of a book is dependent upon the satisfactory function of the construction and all of the material involved an elegant or simple binding on a book made of paper with a very limited life or with leaves that do not open easily because the paper is rigid or badly sewn is an inexcusable waste of skill and money when a new book is being conceived the binder should be involved in the planning stage since he is responsible for an important component of the construction the kind of paper its thickness the direction of grain signature size dimension of the gutter margin type of sewing edge treatment style of binding covering material and related details should not be the undivided responsibility of the designer if rebinding or restoration is necessary it is imperative that the binder or conservator fully understand the purpose of his craft in providing a workable extension to the life of the book in planning a new book the selection of paper should be made after consultation with a person who knows binding the paper in existing books that require rebinding or restoration however presents another problem here the mistakes of the past are frequently seen and must be resolved the binder must carefully decide whether the leaves require washing deacidification sizing total physical support with a supplemental material repair of the folds of the signatures decisions that he should make after discussing the problems with the owner of the book or the librarian who are best qualified to judge the importance of an item and the manner in which it is to be used although paper is the most important element of the physical book and the binding is a protective shell often the binding outlasts the paper a condition too frequently seen in many books produced during the past century middleton in his thorough book on binding techniques describes the stabbing of papyrus leaves with thread through one of the margins as the most primitive form of consolidation  today some mechanized sewing is not unlike this early process and these kinds of curious similarities can be seen in many other variants of the sewing operation another example of the effect of the past is the raised thong or cord sewing probably developed in the tenth century in which the thread is inside the signatures parallel to the folds and anchored to the thongs or cords positioned outside the signatures at the backbone this sewing has stood the test of time and is still used today by many hand binders who are determined to create durable bindings furthermore the basic concept undoubtedly inspired the inventors of the smyth sewing machine and similar ones developed during the latter half of the last century which automatically introduce thread to the signatures as in the raisedcord sewing then knot them together but without the protruding cords on the backbone this type of mechanical sewing used on millions of books being manufactured today provides strength and flexibility on heavy books subject to frequent handling cotton tapes are usually included at the backbone
 the library quarterly through which the sewing is passed the tapes longer than the thickness of the book are anchored to the inside of the case as part of the endsheet this sewing is employed in some european countries for rebinding circulating books after the folds of the signatures are repaired because of the flexibility advantages library binders in our country have not adopted the process claiming that the preparatory work on the signatures is too expensive prior to the invention of the sewing machine the pressures of production brought about compromises in sewing that enabled the binder to produce books rapidly though hand labor was still employed he found that hand sewing a book on a few hemp cords recessed in the backbone was faster than sewing on the traditional five raised cords frequently the covering material on publishers bindings sewn in this way was paper or cloth used as a substitute for the more expensive leather some of the present day hand binders involved in leather binding also favor recessed cord sewing combined with a hollow backbone this backbone is a tubelike partially laminated paper lining to which are sometimes attached artificial raised bands made of strips of cardboard or leather the hollow backbone makes it possible to open a book to the farthest point of the gutter margin and it also provides a relatively inflexible area for gold tooling the advantage of easier opening in the recessed cord hollow backbone construction as in a book with abnormally stiff leaves is offset by significant defects saw cuts across the folds of the signatures are necessary to accommodate the sewing cords a form of mutilation that weakens the paper in a critical area when the book is opened a severe arch forms at the backbone opposed to its normal shape thus causing a strain on the sewing cords then as the binding ages the leather wears away in the joint area followed by the disintegration of the paper folds of the hollow backbone finally the entire backbone comes loose from the binding thus creating the need for an immediate major restoration operation the edition or publishers binding will withstand normal usage in the private library but it suffers when given heavy use in a circulating library frequently the leaves become detached the case loosens from the body and the covering material breaks down prolonging the life of the book is the logical objective in most instances however the manner in which this is done requires intelligent judgment if the book is a rarity it should be set aside for special treatment in the hands of a skilled binder who would have the competence to restore or rebind it an intermediate category should be recognized for those books too significant for the so called library binding yet not qualified for the special treatment the third category should include books that justify simple rebinding within each of the three categories mentioned there are many routes to follow in deciding precisely what should be done with a particular book sorting a collection of books in need of attention requires the knowledgeable judgment of the librarian or book owner who understands the advantages of consulting a qualified binder or conservator simple rebinding could mean the utilization of the existing sewing new endpapers of durable permanent acidfree paper the relining of the backbone and a strong case binding of cloth
binding as related to preservation  or a suitable material if resewing is necessary overcasting or oversewing is generally used done by machine or by hand here the folds of the signatures are cut away and thread is introduced through the gutter margins of the leaves consuming the last one quarter inch of each leaf unless the paper is thin as well as flexible a binding sewn in this way opens poorly and one must exert force on the pages during the reading process it is however a strong sewing technique side sewing not to be confused with that used on pamphlets and slightly related to overcasting used on many new mass produced school and reference case bound books destined for heavy use is undoubtably the most distinctive innovation in commerical binding holes are drilled at high speeds through the gutter margins of the leaves at a ninety degree angle and thread is drawn through the entire book in one operation again reflecting the traditional form side sewn books are frequently rounded and backed although the sewing goes through a portion of the gutter margin books manufactured with this construction in mind are designed with a larger thannormal binding or gutter margin so they can be comfortably read considering simple rebinding grove  points out that some binderies use the adhesive binding techinque also called perfect threadless unsewn or flex rather than overcasting particularly if a book with unusually narrow gutter margins is being rebound the folds of the signatures are trimmed off and the single leaves are then held together with an adhesive applied to the binding edge so that a small amount of it holds each leaf to the adjoining one in some instances the binding edge is serrated to increase the surface and hemp cords are placed in saw cuts across the backbone additional strength is gained with linings of cloth paper or a combination of the two materials adhesive bindings can be rounded backed and put into covers as a case binding or treated as the familiar paperback flexibility and durability at the backbone can be expected if the paper is pliant and of course if the correct adhesive is properly applied the process has its place and many new and old books have been successfully bound in this way but it should not be used on valuable and rare books adhesive binding is not new over  years ago gutta percha and other rubberlike substances were used on a large number of new books some of these were rather elegant publications by now most of these books have probably broken apart as the bonding material crystallized the process was however a beginning its survival is due chiefly to the improved adhesives made available during the past fifty years shortly after the turn of the century the eminent hand bookbinder cockerell focused attention on the rebinding of books in the intermediate category he described them as books of permanent interest but of no special value that require to be well and strongly bound but for which the best and most careful work would be too expensive  p  such work must be done by hand and the materials which are a minor part of the total cost should be stout as well as free of injurious ingredients that would shorten the book life books of this kind should be bound to open easily which excludes overcasting in most instances
 the library quarterly sewing with linen thread over cotton or linen tapes combined with split boards on heavy books is a desirable preliminary treatment strong cloth or the most durable leather or a combination of the two as on a quarter binding should be considered for the covering material unfortunately too frequently books in this category are subjected to casual treatment at the lowest possible price resulting in irreversible damage the rare valuable book in need of rebinding or restoration in a collection should be given to a professional who not only has the skills to bind well but who fully understands the characteristics of all materials involved those he is asked to work on as well as the ones he will add he is professionally obligated to recognize the great wealth of knowledge gathered over the centuries of good bookbinding and to accept new techniques and materials only after they are carefully tested and proven constructional innovations have appeared in extra bound books some of which are excellent but the traditional laced in raised cord sewn headband tight backbone binding with a covering of leather free of excessive acid is generally accepted as best in some instances replica or period bindings are produced when none or very little of the original binding exists and it is desirable to recreate the early appearance here too the materials should be carefully selected the historic construction observed and skilled craftsmanship maintained although the uncut deckle edges one sees on some books is usually viewed with appreciation this irregular surface of white paper is the conservator burden the edge is not under compression so dirt and other atmospheric pollutants easily creep into the leaves and cause discoloration the trimmed edge burnished stained marbled sprinkled or gilded provides a relatively solid surface from which dirt can be readily removed and some of these treatments protect the paper from the penetration of contaminants the wooden panels used on the sides of early manuscripts and printed books served their purpose extremely well their weight and rigidity together with the fore edge clasps frequently used kept the books under favorable compression as books became smaller and were produced in greater numbers a more manageable and cheaper substitute was found in fiber board which is now used everywhere in most bindings today there are interesting variants of the use of individual boards front and back some cases consist of a single board which continues over the backbone from the sides another is made of an extruded plastic sheeting which is stiff enough not to require boards but all give the traditional protection to the leaves of the book although in earliest bindings the boards did not always extend beyond the leaves evidence of the intentional square or projecting board was seen by the middle of the fifteenth century according to middleton  this custom has undoubtably survived because the extra dimension of the board provides a degree of protection to the edges of the book in modern construction by hand or machine we should minimize the size of the square for it creates a problem that affects the life and appearance of the binding a book placed vertically on a shelf will sag in a clockwise direction that is the leaves at the fore edge will drop the distance of the square until they rest on the shelving exerting a strain on the joints and the
binding as related to preservation  backbone as a result the backbones of most books become slightly more convex at the bottom than at the top and the joints of casebindings usually loosen in the earliest bindings leather either tawed with alum and salt or tanned with vegetable products such as wood and bark was applied to the book to protect the backbone construction and to serve as a supplemental hinge over the laced in cords or thongs the binders sought a flexible material that could be made durable and it is obvious their choice was excellent for much of the leather has lasted for centuries during the last century tanners made an effort to expedite the process and at the same time gain an unnatural evenness of color by the application of acids that have proved to be injurious and have resulted in an inferior product the decline of quality tannage is particularly evident in many bindings produced during the latter half of the nineteenth century in  the council of the royal society of arts of england established a committee on leather for bookbinding to investigate the problem and make recommendations for improved tannage as well as binding techniques although this was a commendable beginning it was apparent that further scientific work had to be done as a result in  the printing industry research association and the british leather manufacturers research association with the strong support of r faraday innes the distinguished english leather chemist continued the investigation briefly the group determined that protective organic salts found in early vegetable tanned skins were being washed out in the modern processes and that potassium lactate should be applied to newly tanned skins the purpose of the potassium lactate is to prevent the sulphur dioxide absorbed from the urban atmosphere from causing early disintegration in vegetable tanned leather while other salts have been found to have good protective characteristics most binders involved in treating bound books use potassium lactate the peroxide test was also introduced for determining the durability of leather and it was proposed that skins tanned in the approved way be stamped guaranteed to resist pira printing industry research association test this superior leather is available today skins converted into leather by another process known as chrome tannage have had a very limited use in binding although it is more resistant than vegetable tanned leather to fungal growth and deterioration from injurious atmospheric gases leather created in this way is not easily fabricated a combination of chrome and vegetable tannage which is supposed to have the advantages of each is now being applied to goatskins vellum also made of animal skins has been a strong and enduring covering material for centuries although it is sensitive to humidity and temperature variations which results in warping it is a hardy material that has a natural resistance to the atmospheric gases and only requires an occasional cleaning with an eraser or saddle soap books bound in vellum can be kept more or less compact with fore edge clasps or ties but they should also be shelved under moderate pressure although various fabrics have been used as book covering materials for centuries the popular use of cloth for publishers bindings developed during
 the library quarterly the early s this was a woven cotton material prepared with a gelatine size or starch to prevent the penetration of the glue used for bonding the advantages of an inexpensive massproduced covering material were obvious to the publishers and the binders and cloth manufacturers soon responded with a variety of textures finishes and base fabrics in various weights today we have plain starch filled cloths that give excellent service as well as a variety of impregnated and coated fabrics that can be easily washed and are usually resistant to vermin as a conservation measure it is important in rebinding or in planning a new binding to select a cloth if that is the preferred material with a suitable base fabric that is strong and will adequately support the book currently nonwoven covering material are being used on bindings but it is too early to judge their lasting properties one is made of granulated leather and paper fibers bonded with latex another is composed of impregnated paper fibers a product that deserves special attention consists of matted polyethylene fibers and is remarkably strong even in its thinnest form compositions of this kind are usually treated with a pyroxylin or the superior acrylic coating are colored and can be grained or textured in an unlimited variety of patterns it is also possible to print or hot stamp designs on the surface i have described some of these modern materials science has made possible for it appears they offer economic advantages and can be made strong the materials are now on trial and later we will know more about their permanence only recently has the craft of binding restoration been recognized as one that requires the skills of the highly competent hand binder coupled with ingenuity and a thorough knowledge of materials and constructional techniques everything possible should be done to retain what remains of the original and added materials should be functional chemically safe strong durable and unobtrusive i do not support the idea that added materials should be obviously unlike the original for too frequently this theory becomes the crutch of the haphazard worker who cannot or will not trouble to produce a good restoration the restorer is interested not in deception for little can be done that would escape detection but rather in a sensitive pleasant result should an important book that is disintegrating only be preserved or should it be restored such an item could be wrapped in acid free paper or placed in a protective container which would preserve it somewhat but it would be little more than a museum piece with a very restricted life a book in my opinion should be made usable and restoration is the logical solution if it is important to retain evidence of constructional details photographs and other records can be made before the repairs are begun then kept with the book in addition such a report should include information regarding the new materials used the operations performed the date and the name of the restorer first aid repairs by a well meaning person unfamiliar with materials and techniques frequently result in serious problems that cause irreversible damage to a book not many years ago the useful polyvinyl acetate emulsion adhesive was advocated for the reattachment of loose boards on leather bindings the adhesive was spread over the surface of the leather adjoining the
binding as related to preservation  joint area so it included a portion of the backbone as well as the board upon drying it appeared that the hinge had again been made functional and that a minor miracle had been performed but this was a temporary and false impression ultimately the adhesive peeled away taking the surface of the weak leather with it thus making a sophisticated restoration impossible a parallel illustration involves the familiar handy pressure sensitive tape which has also been misused on valuable bindings many book materials are attractive to vermin and insects support mold spores and bacteria degenerate in the presence of ultraviolet light require favorable humidity and temperature controls suffer in a polluted atmosphere support combustion and create major problems if they become wetyet it is within the scope of human ingenuity to minimize or eliminate these weaknesses the problems of book conservation are not new and a multitude of solutions have been proposed and developed over the years but we must learn to reject or accept them with caution too frequently the well meaning scientist publisher manufacturer supplier binder or conservator or the urgency of the problem causes to be brought forth a material or a process that has not been thoroughly tested under realistic circumstances we are however in an exciting age of innovations and synthetics and a healthy relationship exists between the scientist and the practitioner all of which should bring us closer to our goal what can you do as a conscientious librarian or book owner to fulfill your responsibility as a custodian here are a few suggestions  should you find evidence of vermin or insects enlist the help of an exterminator or entomologist to undertake a professional control program poison baits can be used and you can find reference to many of them but it is best to employ a specialist  if you suspect or see evidence of the development of mold initiate plans for an air conditioning system with positive control over humidity temperature and acidic urban pollution if such a system is not immediately possible excessive humidity in some instances can be reduced with mechanical or chemical dehumidifiers early sterilization should be considered for important books of course one should not wait for mold to develop to use controlled air for all materials in the book will live longer in a favorable environment  the problem of ultraviolet light can be diminished by painting over clear glass windows by installing drapes or blinds over natural light openings and by using plastic filters on light fixtures or fluorescent tubes with built in filtration properties  understand binding restoration and preservation techniques not as a practitioner but as an informed person who can request intelligent help from the specialist  become familiar with approved book cleaning and leather treatment methods the booklet cleaning and preserving bindings and related materials by horton  is highly recommended this is the first of a series of manuals on the conservation of library materials made possible by a grant from the council on library resources inc other manuals yet to be produced will be equally useful a selected bibliography of materials on book preservation appears below

 the library quarterly costs of hand binding at about four times the rate of machine sewing it is probably paying more attention to another factor the condition of the paper mr williams discussed earlier the state of deterioration of library collections the paper in a great many books has become brittle and no longer has the strength to stand machine sewing excluding from discussion those volumes which are normally not considered rebindable one seems to have two choices either repair and hand sew or use adhesive binding adhesive or perfect binding as tribolet points out is not new but it really came into its own seven or eight years ago when new glues were found which remain more flexible and new machinery was developed for better and more efficicent handling when the binders began promoting adhesive bindings they advertised them as the answer to binding those paperbacks which lack adequate sewing margins they looked so good and initial tests were so promising that some librarians began binding a great many other paperbound volumes this way since the binding is so economical and since many new accessions in research libraries are not expected to get heavy use smaller than average volumes which do not have glossy paper lend themselves particularly well to adhesive binding also adhesive binding for those books in which the paper has become brittle has seemed to be a great boon for it has allowed libraries to keep in circulating condition many volumes which otherwise would have had to be replaced by reproductions adhesive bindings also offer a wide selection of cases one has a choice of gold stamped cloth casebindings plastic covered cases etc the quality of materials going into bindings deserves further comment the quality and permanence of the paper going into books is finally receiving serious attention but more attention should be given to binding materials binders seem to be alert to using materials with sufficient initial strength but who worries about the permanence of these materials are the endpapers acid free and permanent is the binding cloth so acidic that it is causing deterioration is that why it gives way so soon at the hinges does the pyroxylin impregnated cloth so popular with library binders now deteriorate faster than the starch filled cloths are the presently used glues causing deterioration of the paper answers to these and many more related questions are needed in the absence of scientific answers some librarians have been asking for a wider use of mylar covered cases since mylar is reported to be an inert material field tests of new materials and new processes should prove satisfactory before one uses them to a great extent but someone has to do the testing mylar was so widely accepted on the paperback bindings that proceeding with mylar cases over sewn bindings seemed worth the risk the university of chicago library has been using them for about four years now on a limited quantity of new materials with apparently very satisfactory results the fact that a mylar binding is cheaper than cloth binding is an added inducement some should be testing the permanence of binding materials at any rate more librarians should begin to show some concern over these problems so that the binders will take greater note of what they are doing for libraries
