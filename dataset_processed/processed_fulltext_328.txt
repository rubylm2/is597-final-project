 the library quarterly cyclopaedia americana at a meeting on february   the members of the society voted to give their library to the trustees of the university after  few new society libraries were started in northern colleges one of the exceptions was at muhlenberg college which was founded in  there both the euterpean society and the sophronian society established their own libraries the euterpeans had a library of  volumes in  and of  volumes in  in the latter year the sophronian society had  books in its library however after the first twenty five years the society libraries very nearly stopped growing meanwhile during the first twenty years the muhlenberg college library added approximately  volumes while the two society libraries had acquired  volumes in the first twenty five years in the fall of  muhlenberg college was moved to a new location and the three libraries were shelved in one room finally in  the three collections were combined physically into a single college library in his survey seeley received reports of only five southern college societies yet there was ample evidence that such societies continued to maintain their libraries well into the  in  the united states bureau of education reported  volumes in the college libraries and  volumes in the society libraries in the district of columbia and seven southern states between  and  both the college and the society libraries of the south showed a decline in the number of volumes the former by  and the latter by  volumes in north carolina the libraries of the euzelian and philomathesian societies at wake forest college were consolidated into one general library under the control of the trustees of the college in  the university of north carolina library and the libraries of the two literary societies were united and named the library of the university of north carolina endowed by the dialectic and philanthropic societies in  the libraries of davidson college and her societies the eumenean and the philanthropic were joined to become the davidson college library in the same year the libraries of trinity college and of the two societies columbian and hesperian were consolidated and became the trinity college library the transfer of the dialectic and philanthropic collections at north carolina was especially interesting since it followed closely the consolidation of the college and society libraries at dartmouth in  at north carolina the society libraries were received into the university library in  but they remained the property of the societies if dissatisfied either society could withdraw from the contract by giving six months notice the dialectic and philanthropic collections were shelved separately and the books of the university library were divided equally and shelved with them this arrangement continued for twenty years not until  did the two societies finally agree to transfer to the university all their proprietary interests in the library at the university of georgia the use  letter from albert smith faught to morris jastrow librarian university of pennsylvania february    letter from albert smith faught to morris jastrow february    john s davidson literary society libraries at muhlenberg college college and research libraries xvii april     breedlove op cit p   powell op cit pp  
college literary societies  of the demosthenian and phi kappa libraries declined rapidly after  finally the two societies donated all their records and books to the department of history of the university in turn the latter turned them over to the university library in the o the libraries of the literary societies of the university of south carolina also declined the clariosophic society offered its library to the university but the latter would agree only to place a bookplate in each volume ascribing it to the donating society the clariosophians did not accept this arrangement until  when the library was finally incorporated with the university library at smaller colleges in the south many society libraries underwent a similar transition from society to college ownership during the last quarter of the nineteenth century at randolph macon college in virginia the washington and franklin literary societies offered their libraries consisting of about  volumes to the board of trustees in  the latter accepted the offer and the librarian was directed to consolidate them with the college library at wofford college in south carolina the libraries of both the calhoun and the preston societies were united with that of the college in  at the time of the union it was estimated that the calhoun library contained about   volumes the preston library about  volumes and the college library about  volumes likewise at southern university in alabama the belles lettres society deeded its library to the university in  the acquisition of the clariosophian society library by the university of south carolina in  may be said to close an era of library consolidation which began in the south about  in the eastern colleges the literary societies had reached their full strength and had already begun to decline by the time of the civil war but in western institutions they did not attain their greatest strength until sometime later indeed they were the most popular and powerful student organizations in western colleges and universities for at least two decades after the civil war society libraries still flourished in western colleges along with the societies themselves in his survey in  seeley reported a total of twenty four society libraries with  volumes in the colleges of six western states in  the united states bureau of education found a total of  volumes in the college libraries and  volumes in the society libraries of indiana michigan missouri ohio and wisconsin in two of the ohio colleges kenyon and marietta the college libraries were only slightly larger than the society libraries on the other hand the university of california northwestern uni frank b davis the literary societies of selected state universities of the lower south unpublished phd dissertation louisiana state university  pp    ibid p   powell op cit p   richard irby history of randolph macon college virginia richmond va whittet  shepperson  p   david duncan wallace history of wofford college   nashville tenn vanderbilt university press  p   daniel p christenberry semi centennial history of the southern university   greensboro ala d p christenberry  p   merle curti and vernon carstensen the university of wisconsin a history   madison university of wisconsin press  i   seeley op cit pp   passim  us bureau of education op cit pp

college literary societies  study four specific illustrations support this generalization first debating and public speaking activities became part of the curriculum thereby depriving the literary society of its major justification for existence second the college or university administration assumed responsibility for the annual commencement activities which included securing well known speakers along with this development the honorary degree took the place of the honorary membership in the societies third other student groups assumed responsibility for editing or publishing the college magazines which were often started by the literary societies finally most of the society libraries were absorbed by the college or university libraries in fact this was the most clear cut example where the literary society lost one of its most important functions to the college administration this study was undertaken to answer the following questions what kind of libraries did the literary societies establish how did they compare with college libraries in quantity and quality why did they flourish before the civil war and why did they virtually disappear by the end of the nineteenth century it has been shown that before the civil war the society libraries were usually superior to the college library in quality and sometimes in quantity after the civil war most of the societies rapidly lost interest in their libraries probably the declining membership of the societies at least in the northern and most of the southern societies made the support of their libraries an impossible burden therefore they were eager to turn their library responsibilities over to the college and university administrations before  the society libraries had been far more accessible to their members and sometimes to other students as well than the college libraries continued access to the society books by the members was usually a condition imposed by the societies when they surrendered possession of their libraries to the college authorities finally the absorption of the society libraries by the college collections occurred at the very time when the latter under librarians like lustin winsor were breaking away from the tradition of book conservation and were beginning to think in terms of service to readers it may be significant that many of the new generation of librarians who were instrumental in organizing the american library association in  were themselves active in literary societies in their college years a few examples will illustrate this point charles coffin jewett librarian brown university smithsonian institution boston public library began his career as librarian of the philermenian society library at brown university two librarians of harvard university john langdon sibley and justin winsor were members of the institute of  john edmands mercantile library philadelphia served as librarian of  op cit i   these activities have been documented in thomas s harding college literary societies their contribution to higher education in the united states   unpublished phd dissertation department of history university of chicago  chaps ii iv vi viii x xii and xiv passim  borome op cit p   institute of  catalogue of the officers and members of the institute of  of harvard university cambridge welch bigelow  co  passim see also joseph a borome the life and letters of justin winsor unpublished phd dissertation faculty of political science columbia university  p
