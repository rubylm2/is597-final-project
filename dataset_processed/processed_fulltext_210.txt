the library quarterly volume  october  number  to reposition a research agenda what american studies can teach the lis community about the library in the life of the useri wayne a wiegand american libraries do three things very well  they make information accessible to millions of people on many subjects  they provide tens of thousands of places where patrons can meet formally as clubs or groups or informally as citizens and students utilizing a civic institution and a cultural agency and  they furnish billions of reading materials to millions of patrons for generations the library and information studies lis community has devoted most of its attention to the first but currently it is poorly positioned to undertake research on the second and third american studies on the other hand is well placed to address the second and third but has largely overlooked american public school and academic libraries as subjects of study this essay invites american studies scholars to develop an lis subspecialty in order to help the american library community better understand its present so that it can more prudently plan its future arnerican libraries are ubiquitous as of this writing there are  public library buildings including branches in the united states that more than mcdonald restaurants  academic libraries  this article is a revised version of two presentations one was presented as the harry ransom lecture university of texas at austin april   the other at the philadelphia conference of the association of library and informatioin science research on january   i am indebted to trysh travis christine pawley john budd mary jo lynch john carlo bertot and chuck mcclure for critical readitngs of this manuscript in previous versions  f william summers professor of library and information studies and professor of american studies florida state university  louis shores building tallahassee florida  telephone    fax    e mail wwiegandlisfsuedu library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
 the library quarterly hundreds of which have extensive systems with multiple libraries nearly  school libraries public and private and  special armed forces and government libraries to a great extent americans have always liked libraries but because libraries have tended to operate in the shadows of the nation cultural landscapes they haven clearly articulated why surprisingly in  librarians themselves still struggle to clearly identify what roles libraries play in their host communities my own study of american library history however suggests that american libraries have done three things exceptionally well in the past century in no particular order of importance they have  made information accessible to millions of people on a variety of subjects  provided tens of thousands of places where patrons have been able to meet formally as clubs or groups or informally as citizens or students utilizing a civic institution and cultural agency and  furnished billions of reading materials to billions of people to demonstrate how often libraries make information accessible at the beginning of the twenty first century one need cite only a few statistics every year for the past five college and university librarians have answered over  million reference questions more than three times the attendance at college football games public librarians annually answer nearly  million reference questions a number that has been growing in recent years almost all academic and public libraries now provide access to the internet more than half of the latter offer classes on its use almost all also now provide electronic access to reference databases and full text periodicals americans visit these ubiquitous civic institutions frequently the office for research  statistics ors of the american library association ala estimates that last year like the previous ten two thirds of this country citizens visited at least one public library at least once per year grade and high school students frequented school library media centers  billion times one and a half times the visits of all people to state and national parks add in visits annually made to public and academic libraries and that numberjumps to  billion more than twice the attendance at movie theaters in this country more than  million patrons visit academic libraries weekly and in the past decade per capita annual visits to public libraries have increased from  to   unless otherwise indicated these and other statistics cited in this essay can be found in httpcsalaorgyourlibraryfactsandfigurescfm httpwwwalaorgord plstat_trends html both accessed last october   and ala office for research and statistics american library association quotable facts about american libraries       and   the quotable facts are wallet sized trifolds
to reposition a research agenda  also patrons use library spaces for many purposes in  for example the ors reported that  children attended public library programs set up for them seven years later these numbers jumped to  some have even estimated that as many children participate in summer reading programs at libraries as play little league baseball in a survey of  public libraries serving populations of over  that ala conducted in   percent reported they hosted reading programs like story telling summer reading and book discussion groups  percent said they provided cultural programming like author presentations and readings musical and dramatic performances and creative writing workshops reading is reflected in circulation data for academic libraries circulation has increased steadily in the past decade to nearly  items per year for public libraries per capita circulation increased from  in  to  in  and libraryjournal notes that in  circulation climbed nearly  from the previous year  in  children accounted for  items circulated seven years later these numbers jumped to  million last year the ors estimates  americans went to a public library to check out a book and a substantial fraction withdrew scores of books during the year statistics like these clearly demonstrate that not only is the american library academic public and school a ubiquitous institution it is now and for the last decade has been a very active civic agency lis and useful knowledge in the past century and ahalf the lis research community has done extremely well in focusing on the traditional library activities of providing access to information on a variety of subjects at the same time however it has narrowly construed the words information learning and education by constructing definitions largely based on rules set down in the seventeenth century that when philosopher michel foucault argues a new order we now call modernity separated people daily life experiences into work and leisure  over time the lis community came to regard as most important the kinds of information that address questions related to work or help people become informed citizens intelligent consumers and educated people and from the seventeenth century on these kinds of information were often labeled useful knowledge acquiring organizing and making useful knowledge accessible is what american libraries of all types have most wanted to do for centuries for example the very first order of books that benjamin franklin sent
 the library quarterly to london in  to begin the library company of philadelphia contained no novels but instead concentrated on dictionaries grammars atlases histories and works on science and agriculture that were suited to the tastes and purposes of young tradesmen  and today because so much of that useful knowledge is being manipulated by information technology the technology itself now largely drives the definition of information in the lis lexicon this is an understandable outcome of a discourse grounded on a professional structure that traces its roots to a late nineteenth century curriculum melvil dewey designed into the world first library school at columbia that curriculum concentrated on two things how to manage the library and what professional expertise it was deemed necessary to develop and exercise in order to help library users get to the useful knowledge they needed in every lis curriculum today one sees these elements given priority attention in core course curricula far above any course one might categorize as library as place or reading but failure to include analysis of library as place or reading questions in its research agenda or its educational curricula prevents the lis community from adequately understanding the social and cultural preconditions that frame the library present an inability to see these deficiencies can be traced to a flawed perspective occasioned by generations of professional library practice where the focus of librarianship and especially its research focus has been professionally selfcentered and focused by constrained definitions of information learning and education these narrowed perspectives have inevitably led the lis community to think primarily about the user in the life of the library to understand values the larger public assigns to the library however it might be more illuminating to focus on the library in the life of the user especially in the areas of place and reading both of which have already found comfortable homes in american studies scholarship a brief glance at place and reading in american studies scholarship will demonstrate the rich potential the field has for repositioning an lis research agenda to look more closely at the library in the life of the user place these days one cannot begin to think about place without considering the ideasjurgen habermas develops in the structural transformation of the public sphere an inquiry into a category of bourgeois society  dur doug zweizig first suggested this perspective in his dissertation  p 
to reposition a research agenda  ing the eighteenth century habermas argues the growing bourgeoisie sought to influence government actions by assuming control of an emerging public sphere of deliberation that eventually found an influential niche between forces exercised by governments and marketplaces within this public sphere members of the bourgeoisie developed their own brand of reason and over time they created a network of institutions and a series of sites eg newspapers and periodicals political parties academic societies and associations in and through which they refined this rationalized discourse into an expression of the ublic interest that governments and markets dared not ignore once habermas theory established the foundation for understanding how a series of social and cultural preconditions shaped the public sphere other scholars began to analyze the institutions and sites in which this rationalized discourse has been practiced by multiple communities and groups that have not been primarily concerned either with political ideology or with marketplace activities and it is out of analyses of these institutions and sites that a refined concept of the role of place as cultural space has emerged while american studies scholars have harnessed habermasian thinking in much recent research eg  lis has yet to apply his constructs about the public sphere to analyze in depth the community role of library as place hints of the possibilities for exploring some of the values communities may be attaching to library as place can perhaps be teased out of conclusions made by robert d putnam in bowling alone the collapse and revival of american community  here putnam hypothesizes that over the past quarter century americans have become increasingly disconnected from family friends neighbors and clubs like the pta the elks even political parties thus depriving themselves of opportunities to share the social capital so necessary to civic and personal health and so essential for building strong community bonds since about  he says americans have largely been bowling alone in the book however putnam does not consider libraries experimental social psychologists have uncovered striking evidence he notes that even the most casual social interaction can  gloria j leckie and jeffrey hopkins have explored the roles two large public libraries in urban canada play as social space see  but their analysis relies mostly on the work of sharon zukin kathleen de la pefna mccook is one of the few lis educators to recognize that the library has a significant role to play in the construction of community see her a place at the table participating in community building  although from a user in the life of the library perspective see also httpwwwimlsgovcloserhtl htm accessed december   which describes a workshop funded by the institute of museum and library services for whichjoan durrance and karen fisher developed tools for librarians to evaluate outcomes of community based services
 the library quarterly have a powerful effect on reciprocity  p  putnam says reciprocity is an essential thread connecting people by it he means il do this for you without expecting anything specific back from you in the confident expectation that someone else will do something for me down the line although he argues that our turn of the century world is characterized by less generalized reciprocity for most of the twentieth century and statistics cited earlier in this essay provide no evidence to suggest that this is changing at the beginning of the twenty first libraries have been places where these casual social interactions have not only occurred they have been encouraged in fact american library history shows that as place be it public school or academicthe library puts community reciprocity on public display putnam also laments that americans tendency to bowl alone is robbing them of opportunities to foster community honesty and social trust although thousands of libraries annually encourage millions of users to withdraw and return community owned reading materials on time of course the lis research community has never analyzed in depth how the library as place influences community honesty and social trust from a library in the life of the user perspective social capital at the neighborhood or community level clearly has an impact on child rearing  p  statistics cited earlier about school library use and public library summer reading programs speak to this issue but other images familiar to readers will amplify the point how many of us as children parents grandparents have participated in the selection of children reading viewing and listening materials from the library how many of us as children parents grandparents have read viewed or listened to these materials in some sort of family setting that has helped to foster bonds lasting a lifetime just by looking at this one dynamic which again is only made visible when we look at the library in the life of the user it is not hard to understand why library as community place seems so important to local neighborhoods reading statistics cited earlier in this essay prove conclusively that the american library whether public school or academic constitutes a major source and site for the act of reading although theye not exactly sure why librarians have always been advocates for reading scan any ala graphics catalog and one will find more than fifty posters with media darlings like shaquille oeal britney spears oprah winfrey marion jones yo yo ma and susan sarandon each holding a book with the word read displayed in huge letters at the top tens of thousands of
to reposition a research agenda  these posters adorn the walls of this nation libraries and there plenty of evidence about reading to demonstrate what patrons expect from librarians in answer to a question ala piggybacked onto an omnibus  telephone survey of  adults about what skills librarians most needed  percent the highest percentage of any category said familiarity with a range of books and authors the survey also asked what activities people do at public libraries  percent also the highest percentage of any category responded borrow books  not only do lis researchers largely overlook the value library patrons attach to the act of reading they also mostly ignore a type of reading not considered useful knowledge because popular fiction is largely considered a leisure activity and thus mostly falls outside the boundaries of the definition of useful knowledge formal education or the concept of learningthe lis community has not valued it highly as a professional service despite the fact that statistics show what libraries do most is facilitate the reading of stories every year for the past half century millions of public and school library patrons have checked out billions of novels in public libraries fiction generally accounts for two thirds of total circulation yet lis professional discourse has barely noticed a growing body of scholarship in american studies and other traditional humanities disciplines now a quarter century oldthat studies the subject of reading stories from a variety of perspectives including literacy studies reader response theory ethnographies of reading the social history of print and cultural studies reading scholars analyze who reads what stories and why by focusing on the complex ways readers from gendered race class and creed based information cultures use what they read and how they apply that reading in their daily lives one of the pioneering works in this field isjanice radway reading the romance women patriarchy and popular literature  an ethnographic case study that describes the multiple ways in which romances function in the lives of a group of women who patronized a particular suburban mall bookstore in the late s for the past twenty years now reading the romance has gone through two editions sold tens of thousands of copies and has been assigned as required reading in scores of english history print culture and american studies courses across the country no one doing research on the social nature and act of reading can afford to ignore it yet a recent book published by ala on romances and libraries does not even cite this germinal american studies text  see  in another guide to romance literature kristin ramsdell briefly mentions radway book but does not attempt to tap radway analysis of romance reading to understand the multiple reasons so many library patrons read romances  p 
 the library quarterly benedict anderson imagined communities reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism  has been equally influential in the scholarship on reading in the book he argues that people organize themselves into large and small imagined communities in order to orient and affiliate with each other cultural texts of all kinds function as agents to help forge imagined communities by providing common sets of experiences including the reading of shared printed texts and meeting as groups on public property and in cultural spaces although anderson work has been heavily cited by scholars across the disciplines no one in lis has asked the question what role have libraries played in the construction of imagined communities more recently jeremy rifkin explores another perspective on information and learning that directly relates to the act and social nature of reading in the age of access how the shift from ownership to access is transforming modern life  he argues we are moving from an age of information to an age of access at the beginning of the twentyfirst century and specifically access to a set of shared cultural experiences rifkin calls them webs of meaning p  that focus on play more than work today he points out entertainment represents the fastest growing industry in the united states and as the nation moves from industrial to cultural capitalism a work ethos is slowing giving way to a play ethos play is what people do when they create culture rifkin says it is the letting free of the human imagination to create shared meanings play is a fundamental category of human behavior without which civilization could not exist p  statistics show that libraries lend a lot of people a lot of popular fiction if rifkin is right one might suggest that some of the most important contributions american libraries make to their communities can be found in the access they provide to the materials and space for play and the learning derived from it perhaps by focusing more research attention on the play that leisure reading fosters among users we might deepen our understanding of why americans like libraries so much in book clubs women and the uses of reading in everyday life  elizabeth long takes reading capacity to stimulate imagination and construct community through shared meaning a giant step further she argues that the modern construction of the solitary reader ignores the thoroughly social base for some kinds of reading she says that this infrastructure includes shared interpretive frameworks participation in a set of institutions and social relations she marries her findings to cultural studies research which notes that in the free will act of social reading readers move into and out of the text and thus appropriate others have even used the word poach meaning relevant to their own lives thus because readers can control it the act of reading
to reposition a research agenda  becomes pleasurable empowering intellectually stimulating and socially bonding elsewhere stephen greenblatt has called parts of this process self fashioning  barbara sicherman has called it selfauthorization  long argues that these processes do not occur in a vacuum but within the boundaries of a social infrastructure where group members mediate their interpretations with each other their cultures and their society this may help explain why millions of people belong to hundreds of thousands of reading groups and book clubs many now meeting on the internet  it may also help explain the increasing number of book festivals begun in recent years across north america  and the popularity of one book one city reading campaigns initiated by hundreds of public libraries in the past five years  connecting the many threads of this scholarship to the library in the life of the user holds much promise one example will demonstrate last year i coedited with tom augst a special issue of american studies entitled the library as an agency of culture  in our call for papers we asked authors to evaluate in new ways the cultural agencies performed by libraries in american life in other words we wanted to find out more about how people actually used libraries in their daily lives especially as it related to reading in a paper we ultimately selected for publication entitled the sound of the civic noise and urban subjectivity at the new york public library pp   author ari kellman makes a strong case for an essential role nypl plays as one of the few places in a noisy city where one can expect a disciplined kind of silence when i initially read through the paper i immediately recalled intellectually stimulating days doing research there right next to people who were very different from me but who pored over the reading materials they had requested every bit as intensely as i did and i remember feeling a sense of community with these people in this controlled space a feeling of community that transcended class gender race creed even age this act of silent reading in this one place bonded us into this temporary community and none of us had to talk to each other about our reading in order to experience that sense of community all of us welcomed and expected the silence that room demanded in a building located in a much larger and invariably much noisier environment cost to lis of ignoring place and reading i would argue the lis community has paid a price for looking too much at the user in the life of the library for mostly identifying the value of

to reposition a research agenda  most ubiquitous institutions that today are sometimes mentioned as anecdotes in lis curricula but are little understood and hardly ever analyzed in lis research potential solution how to address this problem quickly because american studies has defined itself by providing space for interaction among multiple academic disciplines for more than half a century because it has prospered as an institutional site where literature including popular literature connects to history and where history considers the everyday life experiences of ordinary people important enough to study i would like to issue an invitation to american studies scholars i ask them to make a major contribution to the future of this low profile yet highly valued civic institution by taking up the public school and academic library as new research sites by developing a subspecialty in lis studies and by applying what it now knows about american culture learning and play to studying the cultural agencies and practices of the library from the perspective of the library in the life of the user i also encourage american studies departments on campuses across the nation to approach campus lis programs and suggest the possibility of crosslisting courses on the subjects of cultural space and reading in order to address huge gaps in current lis curricula finally i implore the lis community to welcome any such initiatives both communities can only benefit the potential for cooperation is promising it took tom augst and me only two years to put together the library as an agency of culture i think our efforts demonstrate that as an agency of culture and a place where community gets constructed in multiple ways the library constitutes a vast and relatively untapped site for the kinds of research common in american studies where investigations into reading and cultural space are taken seriously the lis community needs to know and understand why the already huge numbers of library readers and visitors continue to climb at the beginning of the twenty first century a particular historical moment when many evangelists of information technology and ill informed politicians and university and school administrators can only see a diminished future for this ubiquitous institution with this issue of library quarterly john bertot and i take over as co editors in an editorial published in july  we outlined our editorial scope for the next five years in it we noted that we wanted to reinvigorate the word library in library quarterly by focusing on two perspectives user in the life of the library and library in the life of
