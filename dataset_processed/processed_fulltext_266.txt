a critical discussion of the ethical presuppositions behind the library bill of rights tony doyle the library quarterly volume  july  number  in the ethical presuppositions behind the library bill of rights martin fricke kay mathiesen and don fallis argue that the presuppositions of the library bill of rights regarding censorship access and paternalism need revision they also maintain that a revised library bill of rights needs to rest on a sound philosophical foundation the foundation they propose is john rawls version of social contract theory i take issue with both claims regarding social contract theory i argue that utilitarianism yields nothing to it regarding the types of materials that libraries should offer and who should have access to those materials as for the library bill of rights itself i criticize parts of their interpretation and their positions on censorship access and paternalism my main concern here is with the authors defense of paternalism in libraries which would commit them to internet filtering i dwell at some length on the dangers of filtering introduction martin fricke kay mathiesen and don fallis offer the ethical presuppositions behind the library bill of rights  to show that the liberal positions on censorship access and paternalism supported by the library bill of rights  pp   and the american library association ala interpretations of them  pp   especially pp   and   and  need qualification after a brief but useful discussion of ethical theory they identify four presuppositions of the  reference librarian hunter college library  park avenue new york new york  telephone    fax    e mail tdoylehuntercunyedu library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved    
 the library quarterly library bill of rights and their ala interpretations  the dissenting opinion should be presented article ii  we ought not to censor article iii  access should not be restricted for certain reasons most notably age article vi  and  paternalism should be avoided  pp    this article focuses on the authors criticisms of presuppositions   against the second presupposition they argue that censorship in libraries is sometimes permissible the third presupposition they contend is too vague about the source of a person right to use the library as well as the limitations on the right to access  p  regarding the fourth presupposition they argue that some measure of paternalism toward minors in libraries is justified in identifying and criticizing these presuppositions the authors seek to provide a sound philosophical basis for a policy on library censorship library access and the kinds of materials that libraries should offer fricke and his coauthors defend a version of social contract theory as the most plausible basis of a revised position on censorship access and mission my primary concern will be with public libraries what follows is a criticism of the following aspects of fricke and his coauthors article first that nothing as strong as presupposition  is actually implied by article iii second in the context of presupposition  that contrary to what the authors imply utilitarianism offers at least as sound a justification as the version of social contract theory that the authors defend for the mission of libraries third that the authors attempt to put access largely in the context of voluntary and involuntary features of patrons is faulty and fourth that the authors defense of paternalism with regard to minors has alarming implications for internet filtering in libraries the article finishes with a discussion of the hazards of filtering the library bill of rights and censorship article iii of the library bill of rights states that libraries should challenge censorship in the fulfillment of their responsibility to provide information and enlightenment  p  its presupposition according to the authors is that we ought not to censor the authors point out that there is much that can inform and enlighten that libraries should not provide they offer three strong examples  pp   first there is information whose distribution would violate intellectual property rights second they mention information that would  the ala officially opposes infringements on intellectual property see  
a critical discussion  if publicly available be unduly invasive of privacy  for instance information about a person genome such information could be used to deprive a person of a job or of medical or life insurance third they bring up the results of the monstrous medical experiments conducted by the nazis on death camp inmates no doubt much valuable medical information could be gleaned from these files still the authors plausibly contend we might decide not to disseminate this information out of a desire to show respect for the victims and total abhorrence for the means of acquisition of the information  pp   also opening these files might though this is speculative weaken the restrictions on or reservations about this kind of research in the future the authors score a point against article iii here all three types of materials could both inform and enlighten yet because of the potential harm that unrestricted access could lead to we should not provide library access to them and not just there examples two and three are fit objects of suppression generally they conclude such examples indicate that there are competing values that at least sometimes override this unconditional principle as a result it seems that the ala should adopt a more moderate position that recognizes the exceptions to article iii  p  right but does article iii urge unconditional opposition to censorship as the authors suggest compare the language of presupposition  with that of article iii the former declares that libraries should not censor  at all the article itself however enjoins libraries to challenge censorship insofar as the practice inhibits their mission to inform and enlighten pornography for instance does neither so article iii does not oblige libraries to oppose attempts to censor it what about an astrology magazine that carries nothing but false advertising would libraries be obliged consistent with article iii to fight attempts to remove it from the shelves maybe not also look at the phrase provide information and enlightenment emphasis added contrary to what fricke and his coauthors imply  p  the most plausible way to interpret this phrase is that libraries should only challenge the censorship of materials that both inform and enlighten compare i want to go to rome and florence on my next vacation with i want to go to rome or florence on my next vacation on this reading libraries might not be obliged to oppose those who would censor bomb making sources either such materials are undeniably informative though hardly enlightening so they do not inform and enlighten it looks like article iii does not support the unconditional principle expressed by presupposition  after all
 the library quarterly philosophical foundations access and limiting access philosophical foundations and access fricke and his coauthors look at several arguments for why libraries should offer a broad range of materials and make them accessible to all one the argument from truth is a utilitarian argument deriving from john stuart mill as a utilitarian mill was concerned to promote those policies or practices that best conduce to human welfare that tend to maximize net happiness or utility the total balance of happiness over unhappiness where everyone well being is weighed equally in chapter  of on liberty of the liberty of thought and discussion mill maintained that society is better off the higher proportion of true to false beliefs that it holds  p   he argued that nearly unfettered speech and access to that speech is the most reliable means of uncovering truth if we want to give truth our best shot we have to permit expression of all points of view since we cannot know whether or not an idea is true unless it gets expressed once a view is expressed the best way to determine whether it is true or well founded is to expose it to no holds barred criticism this implies not only free expression of ideas but unrestricted access to this expression people need to know not only what can be said against what they do not believe but also what can be said for it they should be aware both of what supports and gainsays their views only those views that survive rigorous debate deserve our fealty  pp    applying mill argument to libraries we can say that they play a crucial role in ensuring that people have access to all views they are repositories of free speech and thus help promote truth or at least help to ensure that people empirical and moral beliefs are well justified we will see below that the version of the social contract theory that the authors support can accommodate the argument from truth there are four further things to note about mill position first he was not opposed to all censorship of speech one restriction he urged is for speech whose expression constitutes a positive instigation to some mischievous act  p   for instance speech calculated to incite a riot  p  or other forms of immediate physical harm like gratuitously yelling kill to an attack dog in the presence of an innocent bystander  p  although mill does not say so presumably he would restrict libel and speech involving criminal conspiracy neither has any tendency to advance truth second his opposition to censorship as suggested above is limited to ideas that is to expression  for a criticism of mill contention that open discussion and the conflict of ideas is the surest way to the truth see  pp   
a critical discussion  purporting to be true hence the argument from truth is silent about much fiction and poetry about images and about nonlinguistic expressive acts like flag burning  p   third mill as a utilitarian makes no appeal to moral rights  p  which at any rate play no role in the utilitarian conception of morality  pp   if we ought to remove nearly all restrictions on discussion and access it is because the balance of happiness over unhappiness will be increased by doing so and not because people have a moral right to express or hear all points of view compare  pp   i say more about rights presently  fourth the argument implies that all should have access to all the ideas that libraries provide since open access promotes truth a second argument for open access that the authors mention is the argument from democracy  p  see  pp   morally speaking the argument contends democracy is the best form of government but robust democracy requires a citizenry that is free to seek out all relevant information regarding and to express its views on public policy and candidates for public office unrestricted expression and access are also a further means of keeping its representatives accountable libraries play an important role in providing citizens with the information they need to meet these ends in addition the authors plausibly contend that libraries have an obligation to offer more than what the two arguments just canvassed are committed to the authors are well aware of the limitations of the argument from truth rehearsed above  pp   and  as for the argument from democracy it applies only to government information    it does not require public libraries to carry as a matter of responsibility or duty other documents that are not part of the democratic process such as a stephen king novel or those documents relaying the latest baseball scores  p  also the argument applies only to full citizens and not to minors or aliens  p  to supplement the arguments from truth and democracy fricke and his coauthors appeal to john rawls version of the social contract theory social contract theory has typically been offered as a means of  morally justifying the existence of government  specifying which types of government and what institutions are morally justified and  limiting the state coercive authority social contract theorists claim that government exists to protect our moral rights which we have independently of the state authority but which would not be adequately protected in anarchy rights to borrow ronald dworkin metaphor are trumps that from the moral point of view override authorities or other citizens attempts to infringe them barring a conflicting overriding right  pp    as fricke and his coauthors put it rights are justified claims or entitlements against others  p  for instance if i
 the library quarterly have the moral right to free speech no one is morally justified in depriving me of that right unless another right trumps it that is to say others have a moral obligation to refrain from restricting or prohibiting my speech other things being equal rights are also trumps against utility in other words they are not necessarily overridden even if more net happiness will result by doing so  pp  and   and  pp     and   fricke mathiesen and fallis explain that moral rights are typically distinguished into liberty rights and welfare rights the former simply require  ther people to refrain from interfering with the exercise of the right the latter make it a duty or responsibility for some other person or institution to satisfy or meet the right  p  the distinction sheds light on the arguments from truth and democracy both could support the equivalent of a welfare right to information necessary to promote truth the argument from truth or strengthen democracy the argument from democracy  public libraries exist in part for the sake of this right rights theorists differ about the provenance of rights according to some social contract theorists for instance john locke  pp   and robert nozick  p ix rights preexist the social contract and thus any consensus about what rights people should have for rawls by contrast rights are the upshot of a hypothetical agreement they do not exist prior to or independent of the social contract he asks us to imagine a group of self interested rational people coming together to decide what basic rights and duties people should have these contractors are to determine the fundamental terms of their association which will regulate all subsequent criticism and reform of institutions  pp   see also p   to ensure that the original agreement as rawls calls it is fair  to ensure that none of the contractors is able wittingly to bias the agreement in his or her favor  he supposes that they deliberate behind a veil of ignorance  pp     and    the veil masks all knowledge of individual characteristics of those in the so called original position sex race class age intelligence sexual preference physical characteristics wealth conception of the good or the generation to which they will belong  pp    and  although they are aware of the general facts about human society  p  see also pp  and  the contractors must choose principles the consequences of which they are prepared to live with whatever generation they turn out to belong to  p  their agreement requires the unanimous consent of the contractors  pp    the fairness imposed by the veil ensures that the principles chosen will embody justice rawls contends that the contractors will agree on two fundamental principles rights derive from these the first principle the equality
a critical discussion  principle states that each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others  p   this principle guarantees free speech and the franchise among other rights equally to all citizens although rawls does not say one can imagine the contractors agreeing on the principle of complete liberty of speech on the basis of the arguments from truth and democracy the second the difference principle says that inequalities in wealth and other social benefits are acceptable as long as they can be a reasonably expected to be to everyone advantage and b are attached to positions and offices open to all  p  the first principle has priority over the second p  meaning that free speech for instance cannot be abridged for the sake of greater social and economic advantages  p  see also pp   and  this ranking removes the possibility of conflict the bane of most rights theories see  pp   it also means that the prospect of increased utility cannot override the equality principle  pp   although the authors do not identify either principle both are relevant to their discussion the equality principle is relevant because it implies a liberty right to nearly complete freedom of expression of and access to all points of view the difference principle bears on the authors case in the following way again behind the veil the contractors will not know what their concept of the good is although they will know that they have such a concept and a corresponding rational plan of life  p  and that both will be revealed to them once the veil is lifted the veil will ensure that they choose a society governed by basic rules that conduce to as many different conceptions of the good or as many life plans as possible it will prevent the contractors from deliberately choosing a scheme that favors their own conception of the good life over others extending rawls scheme fricke mathiesen and fallis ask us to suppose that we in the original position have to decide whether and what kind of information will be available to us as members of society  p   the authors plausibly contend that the veil will prompt the contractors to insist that benefits like access to information be distributed to everyone advantage with particular regard to those at the socioeconomic bottom for the contractors will see that information is essential to carrying out any plan  p  appealing to the difference principle we can say that access to information will be not merely a liberty right which is all that the equality principle guarantees it will also be a welfare right requiring others to help one have access to that information needed to live according to one conception of the good see  p  in other words not only should the state not interfere with what one says reads sees or hears government has a further obligation to provide access to the kind of
 the library quarterly information that one needs to live according to one conception of the good which likely includes being rational well informed and entertained information is a commodity a benefit a good again the difference principle implies that goods should be distributed equally unless some inequality benefits all we can imagine how some inequalities in information distribution might do this  for example trade secrets or state secrets during a morally justified war putting aside these exceptions the difference principle implies that all should have equal access to the kinds of information central to the arguments from truth and democracy libraries would play an important role here moreover the authors conjecture the contractors in the original position would recognize the likelihood that their conception of the good will require access to a broader range of information than the arguments from truth and democracy require see  pp  and  the contractors will realize that they will probably want to have ready access to fiction poetry art books or recorded music they will insist that these types of materials also be widely distributed and be easily and cheaply available ideally in public libraries consider a book that is merely entertaining reading it is not going to make anyone a wiser voter and it certainly does not contain any government information even so access to such a book can be justified on the grounds that reading books that are merely entertaining promotes the conception of the good of at least some and probably many members of society  p  children too are included behind the veil of ignorance you do not know what your position in society will be you may end up being a child    trying to achieve and develop your own conception of the good thus behind the veil of ignorance you will decide that children should have access to the information that they need in order to do so  p  also the authors might have added since those in the original position will not know whether they will be citizens of the society in which they spend the bulk of their lives they will urge that libraries with their broad array of information be open to aliens as well it does not follow though that everything in the library will be available to all in particular it does not follow that children will be able to see or read everything or surf the internet as they please again remember the conditions of the original position behind the veil you would not know whether you will wind up a twelve year old boy with a yen for pornography or his potentially anxious mother hence you would certainly not endorse principles that allowed minors to pursue their conception of the good however they see fit it is reasonable for you to conclude behind the veil of ignorance that it is best for
a critical discussion  children not to have access to pornography even if you end up being a child who wants such access  p  i say more about paternalism below the preceding argument is an admirable application of rawls ideas to the questions of why we should have public libraries what kinds of materials they should offer and who should have access to these materials however i think the authors are too quick to dismiss the possibility of a utilitarian justification for a similar conception of libraries at least regarding the first two questions they compare utilitarianism unfavorably with their  ypothetical social contract argument claiming that it would not support libraries with as liberal a policy on access or with as broad a range of information as does their rawlsian position  p   this criticism is unfair to utilitarianism  by which the authors apparently mean mill argument from truth  on two counts first it is wrong to suggest that the argument from truth does not support access to as wide an audience as the rawlsian argument maximizing access to all ideas is crucial to truth emergence and free access for all  citizens and noncitizens children and adults  helps ensure that the library audience is the broadest possible the broader the audience the more effective the promotion of truth second the authors are right to suggest that as pointed out above the argument from truth only obliges libraries to provide materials likely to promote truth the same could be said about the argument from democracy however these arguments are hardly the only ones available to utilitarians in support of libraries offering other kinds of materials in fact it turns out that a utilitarian conception of the role of libraries will end up looking a lot like the rawlsian in other words utilitarians can endorse the notion that libraries provide as wide a spectrum of information to as many kinds of people as the authors hypothetical contract justification unlike rawls theory utilitarianism is formally neutral on how good  that is happiness or the satisfaction of desires or preferences  should be distributed utilitarianism contains no provision that inequalities be to everyone advantage all that matters is whether or not a given action practice or policy leads to more net happiness than any other alternative see  p   pp   and   and  p   however the way in which the means to happiness such as income adequate housing or information is parceled out can profoundly affect the net good in a given society  p  utilitarians can plausibly contend that benefits and burdens should be distributed equally unless an unequal distribution boosts utility for instance incomes should be equal unless more utility accrues to some inequality
 the library quarterly see  p  it does higher salaries can induce hard work and can make some occupations more competitive than others the utilitarian would agree with rawls that higher salaries should be attached to those socially useful jobs that require considerable sacrifice and that we want to be highly competitive so that only the most capable people will qualify surgery civil engineering and computer programming are examples how much inequality utilitarians will sanction depends on the amount that maximizes utility furthermore the utilitarian will insist that equal opportunity go along with these inequalities in income again for considerations of utility being well informed is essential to equal opportunity entertainment too is beneficial people are generally better off having affordable access to it than not take fiction read either for entertainment or edification making an array of novels available to people in public libraries no doubt increases utility moreover making this material available to citizens and noncitizens alike as well as to children is more likely to maximize utility than depriving noncitizens and children of the information as we saw above the argument from truth applies to noncitizens minors too need to have access to all points of view since this will help them cultivate the critical skills needed to decide which controversial claims are most justified and to be informed participants in democracy when they come of age similarly noncitizens and children benefit from having access to entertaining items to the same extent as adult citizens thus it looks contrary to fricke and his coauthors as if there is a plausible utilitarian justification for the broad mission of libraries that they defend on rawlsian grounds and the utilitarian justification comes without the fictional assumption of an original agreement struck behind a veil of ignorance limiting access fricke and his coauthors suggest that limiting patron access can be understood largely in terms of a person voluntary and involuntary characteristics  pp   the former are under a person control  for instance loud speech or poor hygiene the latter are not age sex or race are examples of course some features like weight or drug addiction are in between the authors concede this  p   i will join them in ignoring the gray area for now the authors imply that involuntary features are generally not relevant to excluding access while voluntary ones  for example deliberately setting the book drop on fire  are  pp  and  to wit there is something odd about denying access to anyone who is genuinely a member of the library constituency on the basis of an involuntary feature the reason is that there is nothing that the patron can do about it  p 
a critical discussion  after all the distinction between an involuntary and a voluntary feature can be stated simply as that between what a person is and how he behaves  p  this criterion for limiting patron access will not do what about involuntary disruptive behavior like that induced by tourette syndrome undesirable voluntary features are amenable to blame censure or punishment the occasional vulgar outbursts of a tourette sufferer are not that a patron so afflicted could not have done otherwise seems beside the point libraries could still reasonably exclude him also as we saw in the preceding section and will see at greater length in the next section the authors want to leave open the possibility that minors can be denied access to some library materials but as the authors themselves acknowledge age is involuntary  p  see also pp    given these two counterexamples it is difficult then to see just what bearing the distinction between voluntary and involuntary features is supposed to have on access paternalism the following discussion is based on the authors criticism of presuppositions  and  presupposition  reads access should not be restricted for certain reasons most notably age  p  the authors derive this presupposition from article v of the library bill of rights a person right to use a library should not be denied or abridged because of origin age background or views  p  presupposition  states paternalism should be avoided fricke and his coauthors rightly infer this presupposition from both article v of the library bill of rights  p  and from the ala interpretation of this article  pp   and   the authors define paternalism as follows paternalism usually involves the ones that are being paternal deciding what is best on behalf of the others usually without their consent  p   we saw briefly in the section before last that fricke and his coauthors believe that those in the original position would likely sanction some form of paternalism the authors are nevertheless wary of paternalism save where the receiving group is less than fully competent by virtue of being young infirm mentally ill and so on then a defense can be made for paternalistic action both for promoting good and for avoiding harm  p  obviously parents are generally morally justified in behaving paternally toward their children regarding what the latter see hear or read in and out of the house the ala agrees  for a fuller account of paternalism see  pp  
 the library quarterly  p   so contend the authors are other adults even strangers when the parents or guardian s are absent or incompetent  p   the authors further argue that if some types of paternalism toward minors are often justified outside of the library then they are justified within but the ala present policy regarding access is age blind libraries abjure acting in loco parentis with regard to library materials it is not librarians responsibility to take over for parents in deciding what books or images are appropriate for children  pp   and  fricke and his coauthors object it is reasonable to assume that parents would not want their child accessing hard core pornography thus by stopping a child from accessing such material you are not aking over from the parent you are helping the parent  p  the authors appeal to the following analogy to support their case all would acknowledge that a stranger has the responsibility to stop a child from electrocuting herself by sticking a fork in a live socket similarly when it comes to pornography librarians should not stand by and watch a child lectrocute herself let alone help the child find a fork which seems to be the present ala policy   p  see  pp  the authors identify the source of the ala resistance to paternalism in how the organization deals with fallibilism the fallibilist claims that we should hold beliefs and theories tentatively she supposes that any belief or theory can be revised in the light of future experience the authors too embrace fallibilism which in the present context implies that any exercise in censorship is likely occasionally to go awry some of what censors exclude should not have been excluded false positives  and some of what they permit should have been censored false negatives  p  see also  pp   the authors claim that the ala response to fallibilism is to propose that we not make any judgments or choices or decisions at all they that is the ala wish not to censor anything or to label anything not to deny anyone access and never to act paternally  p  see  pp    and   regarding the claim that the ala opposes all censorship we have seen that the library bill of rights implies nothing so unconditional more to the present point fricke and his coauthors deny that fallibilism is committed to a wholesale rejection of censorship or paternalism arguing that similar reasoning would imply that we should never try suspected murderers for fear of a wrongful conviction  pp   their conclusion it is better to make the occasional mistake in censoring labeling excluding or acting paternally than it is to have a system of anything goes which is what the lbr seems to commit us to with respect to for example access to the internet  p 
a critical discussion  the analogy with murder is strained juries are enlisted to determine guilt beyond a reasonable doubt defense and prosecution adduce evidence and offer testimony in support of a their cases but what is the evidence that some types of pornography harm children if there is any the authors have not revealed it also without this evidence the electrocution analogy in the paragraph before last seems at best hyperbolic not only do the authors fail to provide evidence that access to some types of pornography poses a potentially lethal threat to children they offer no evidence that such access poses any threat to return to the murder analogy most would surely agree that the cost of occasional wrongful convictions is worth the benefit of generally effective prosecution and conviction of those who have done the deed so long as considerable safeguards against wrongful conviction exist but again the analogy seems less than perfect first the history of censorship is at best checkered time and again materials have been proscribed not because they were dangerous but because they were deemed antireligious because they were contrary to prevailing sexual morality or because they were perceived to be a political threat by those in power second materials are often excluded by type  hardcore pornographic hateful violent  rather than item by item as a result items are often not allowed to have their own case pleaded for them beforehand this is especially a problem with blocked internet sites as we will see below nevertheless the authors are undoubtedly on to something there is much to give even stout liberals pause over the ala policy particularly in light of the easy availability over the internet of the kind of smut that the vast majority of them find deeply offensive no conscientious parent really wants her child consulting hard core pornography at home online fricke and his coauthors are right to point out that she doubtless is not eager to have the child contemplating it in the public library either traditionally as repositories of books and periodicals libraries have not provided dirty pictures this practice has changed with the installation of computers with internet access although they do not broach internet filtering fricke and his coauthors position on paternalism apparently commits them to endorse some form of it in libraries  pp  and  in fact they even intimate that they would tolerate filtering so that adults too would not have to take in unbidden explicit images on public access internet computers  p  however before we can conclude that the ala should renounce its staunch opposition to paternalism or internet filtering we need to look at the nature of filtering software and the costs of attempting to prevent the display of  inappropriate or unsuitable material on the internet in libraries
 the library quarterly internet filtering internet filtering software changes faster than high fashion and any discussion of the state of the art now is likely to be history tomorrow i hope though that what follows continues to pertain to censorware for a useful piece of the future one way in which such software attempts to sift out unwanted sites is by keyword this kind of software specifies a list of words or phrases such that if any of them occurs in the site header or in the site itself depending on the software that site is blocked anyone who has searched by keyword in a database knows the perils on the one hand one is often surprised by even dismayed at the number of false hits that such searches can yield on the other hand and more important in the present context one is often frustrated at not being able to find information that one knows is out there with keyword filters the problem is this no matter how subtly the software is written it will inevitably permit access to undesirable sites false negatives and block useful or even unexceptionable sites false positives  for liberals false positives are the real concern the stories of false positives in keyword blocking are legion for example if the software blocks variants of sex sites containing some form of the word but which are actually about safe sex abstinence or gender or that mention sextants sexton or middlesex and so on could be blocked here are two more examples from a  version of cybersitter in those early days of the internet it would block out robert frost snowy evening because it contained queer television actress pamela anderson lee name also raised the red flag  see  p  more recently kurt kleiner has revealed how mainstream censorware has blocked web sites of the mit student association for freedom of expression the international gay and lesbian human rights commission the village voice and the christian broadcasting network to name just a few see  p  for other recent examples see  a more accurate way of blocking sites is by address users are denied access to any blacklisted site this approach has an obvious advantage over keyword blocking only intended sites are blocked barring mistakes however coming up with the addresses is laborious and expensive also any list will be woefully incomplete from the outset and will require constant updating which itself is bound to miss a lot third usually users will not know what they are missing the makers of this software are understandably reluctant to reveal the contents of their list since this secrecy is what makes the products valuable this situa for other examples see  pp    p   p  and  pp  
a critical discussion  tion is bad enough at home far worse in libraries where not even librarians will know what is being shut out   p   p  it is also a problem with keyword censorware where the keyword list is protected speaking of both methods of blocking joshua marshall points out  p  that this kind of censorship is different from the old days of book banning those who would ban books generally had to wage public battle raising the issue of just which books they wanted to strike from public schools or libraries no longer this newer bowdlerization is far stealthier finally given the great expense involved in heaping up a congeries of forbidden fruit companies will have to sign up many customers to be profitable this suggests that there will likely be few companies in the future with the resources to compete creating the prospect of precious few controlling a good deal of the flow of information  pp    as with censorship in other contexts the threat of abuse here is considerable take the time honored question of just who is making the decisions about what is appropriate and what their agenda is for instance solid oak software the makers of cybersitter decided that gay and presumably other references to homosexuality was inappropriate sometimes of course a company agenda might have more to do with the market or with responding to various pressure groups than with internet safety even sites that the software company itself finds objectionable  sites that the user might want to have access to  can be blocked for example the manufacturer might blacklist anticensorship sites or even sites that are critical of the manufacturer own blocking practices as did solid oak software in  see  p   p   p  also see   pp  and  and  p  when such software is installed in libraries or when internet providers or internet search engines filter or block censorship is imposed from without by private companies who answer not to the electorate but to their stockholders other private companies or public institutions like schools and libraries see  pp  and   pp   see also  p   p  and  p    there is actually a third way the platform for internet content selection pics  which in theory enables users and organizations to decide for themselves which portions of the internet they will have access to depending on the rating of a site ratings can be assigned by the site creator or imposed by a third party such a system raises serious censorship problems of its own see  p   pp   and  pp   however discussion of pics has petered out since   for some other considerations against filtering see  for defenses of filtering see   and 
 the library quarterly paternalism and censorship again to return to the issue of censorship for minors generally fricke and his coauthors concede that mistakes are inevitable yet worth the costs of keeping children from certain types of potentially harmful material  p  perhaps their main concern is pornography and they imply that consulting it or at least certain types of it is seriously harmful to minors however as mentioned above fricke and his coauthors adduce no evidence for this claim the fact that parents believe that some types of pornography are harmful does not show that they are still less does it show that children ought to be protected from this material in public libraries by analogy the fact that some parents think that antireligious books or web sites harm their children is no evidence that they do again it does not show that their children access to such messages should be restricted out of the home nevertheless the authors are right to point out that mistakes in library censorship are not usually disastrous or irreversible  p   unlike wrongful convictions or executions library censorship seldom comes to burning books  p  seldomer still does it come to burning all extant copies of a given book fricke and his coauthors might also have observed that even if gorging their eyes on hard core pornography does not harm minors probably little is lost by denying them access to this material perhaps too as long as we do not know the effects of exposure to pornography on young people society should err on the side of caution and keep it out of their way lack of evidence that pornography is harmful does not show conclusively that it does no harm and once they turn eighteen or whatever the age of legal majority happens to be  they will be free to make up for lost time of course this line of reasoning assumes that minors would not simultaneously be denied access to valuable or uncontroversial material along the way to repeat it is difficult to see how this balance could be struck also this concession assumes that there are acceptable criteria for what counts as hard core pornography along with reasonable assurances that those criteria will be correctly applied fricke and his coauthors themselves write as if what counts as pornography is uncontroversial for example  p  which it is not what is considered pornographic varies with culture time and even person likewise with regard to what counts as hate speech or blasphemous material and whether or not it ought to be protected or proscribed i am thus pessimistic that generally accepted criteria for what counts as pornography or hard core pornography could be devised however let us assume  for a discussion of whether pornography harms minors see  p 
a critical discussion  for the sake of discussion that all parties could agree on a definition of hard core pornography and that the definition is serviceable maybe then libraries could effectively restrict access to print pornography without denying access to nonpornography maybe too such restriction would be consistent with the utilitarian conception of expressive freedom defended in this article however we have just seen that the short history of internet filtering suggests that separating the wheat from the chaff online is even less straightforward than with print since the authors have not grappled with this issue nothing that they say should persuade readers that public libraries should adopt censorware in the interests of benign paternalism and the just canvassed flaws of filtering software suggest that there is a positive reason for resisting its installation the arguments from truth and democracy offer further reasons since filtering can stifle material that promotes truth or strengthens democracy also who censors the authors respond that the worry about who the censoring authorities should be is analogous to a worry that people might have about the crime of murder that is who should make the decision as to whether or not a particular person should be convicted of murder  p  is it first we have a well established if not entirely perfect mechanism for choosing jurors second jurors are enlisted to decide guilt or nonguilt in the light of the evidence presented in court neither mechanism currently exists for judging candidates for censorship and the history of censorship suggests that the ala concerns about a reliable mechanism for socially responsible censorship are well founded see  pp xix xlvii see also references   the authors themselves suggest that it is chiefly librarians who should censor and thus determine what gets screened on the internet  p   this assumes what is dubious that librarians have an expertise here second it ignores the perils of censorware discussed above since again many of these products do not even permit librarians to determine what does not get through instead they and their users will have to repose faith in the decisions of private companies about which sites or types of sites are inappropriate objectionable or unsafe conclusion fricke mathiesen and fallis have done a fine job of analyzing the library bill of rights and of attempting to uncover their philosophical foundation they make a credible case that as stated the document needs modification it is perhaps too cavalier in its opposition to most
 the library quarterly forms of censorship too sweeping in its condemnation of paternalism although in both cases i have tried to show that the ala position is not as wide of the mark as the authors would have it i have tried to show they are wrong to assume that the only justification for a network of public libraries with near universal access and a wide array of materials is a rights based rawlsian approach utilitarianism makes at least as strong a case finally they are a bit facile in their claim that the limited paternalism and concomitant censorship that they urge can be achieved without outweighing harms particularly with regard to internet access references  fricke martin mathiesen kay and fallis don the ethical presuppositions behind the library bill of rights library quarterly  october     office for intellectual freedom of the american library association intellectual freedom manual chicago american library association   office for intellectual freedom of the american library association libraries an american value httpwwwalaorgalaorgoifethicshtml last accessed may    office for intellectual freedom of the american library association code of ethics of the american library association httpwwwalaorgoifethicshtml last accessed may    mill john stuart on liberty edited by david spitz new york norton   brison susan j the autonomy defense of free speech ethics  january     mackinnon catharine a only words cambridge mass harvard university press   smart j j с distributive justice and utilitarianism injustice and economic distribution edited by john arthur and william h shaw pp   englewood cliffs n j prentice hall   dworkin ronald taking eights seriously cambridge mass harvard university press   rawls john a theory of justice cambridge mass belknap   locke john the second treatise of government edited by thomas p peardon new york macmillan   nozick robert anarchy state and utopia new york basic books   smart j j c an outline of a system of utilitarian ethics in utilitarianism for and against edited byj j c smart and bernard williams pp   cambridge cambridge university press   feinberg joel social philosophy englewood cliffs nj prentice hall   heins majorie screening out sex kids computers and the new censors american prospect  july august     powell adam clayton iii children the internet and free speech media studies journalu fall     wallich paul parental discretion advised scientific american  august    westfall joseph cybersmut business and society review  spring
