the collection and use of information by some american historians a study of motives and methods donald owen case previous literature on the information needs and uses of historians has tended to focus on the use of libraries and specific types of materials rather than on the motivations for and results of such use yet understanding this prior process of historical inquiry might help us to develop improved services and facilities for scholars a study of twenty american historians was conducted in order to better understand the nature of research in history respondents were asked about their choice of research topics specific projects in progress use of archives categorization of materials collected writing habits and use of computers interviews were tape recorded transcribed and analyzed using standard qualitative techniques the results are discussed in the light of previous investigations of historians and the published statements of classification experts regarding the organization of historical knowledge suggestions for future study of historians are offered and implications for libraries are explored throughout the many hundreds of published articles and books that have described the information needs and uses of various occupational social or economic groups relatively few notably   have focused on the historian perhaps another twenty studies among them   have considered the broad category of humanists that may also include historians a few of the many studies of social scientists have also included historians besides the sheer lack of studies those that exist have focused on somewhat different activities use of archives and libraries attitudes toward libraries and librarians use of specific types of literature and tools citation patterns and in a few cases work habits history remains an area in which actual behavior rather than artifacts of behavior such  graduate school of library and information science university of california los angeles  hilgard avenue los angeles california   library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved      
 the library quarterly as is revealed by citations has not been well studied shepherd  p  notes that there has been little investigation on any large scale and in any depth of the methodology of historical research employed by academics by far the most common focus for studies of historians has been the kinds of literature they use the earliest studies by mcanally  and alston  investigated the use of materials and citations to them documenting the heavy use of monographs and unpublished material that seems characteristic of historical research rundell study  examined the way in which historians carry out their search for information noting the importance of sources in general and archives in particular jones chapman and woods  also focused on the use of literature stieg work  dealt with historians use of periodicals and bibliographical tools thus far only uva  and orbach  have examined aspects of what historians actually do in their research for example the choice of topics the motivations for their studies the stages of their projects the collection of evidence and their writing processes unfortunately uva and orbach have not published their studies in order to serve scholars better we must focus our attention more closely on the actual behaviors of scholars most studies of historians tell us little about the nature of inquiry in the field of history but rather tell us only about aggregated uses of libraries and types of materials building on our knowledge of historians use of archives libraries and the materials therein we can now address the nature of their needs in a deeper fashion to that end the present investigation examines the practices and thinking of twenty academic historians of the united states by eliciting from them detailed descriptions of their work the results of extensive interviews with twenty historians are described and analyzed with the intention of reaching a better understanding of their use of information for research several conclusions are drawn regarding future studies of historians and potential implications for libraries i begin by reviewing what historians themselves have said about the nature of their enterprise and then consider relevant literature in library and information science the structure of history according to historians what do historians say that they do the nature of historical methodologies has been examined by many historians for example   and so will be explored here only briefly regarding the scope of their enterprise historians usually speak in abstract terms as when asa briggs describes historians as concerned with the whole range of human experi

use of information by historians  those covered by other fields within the social sciences and humanities adding a time dimension to the normal range of possible subject headings poses special problems for historians leff for instance describes his view of how periods are formed as sic its simplest we can say that a period is the outcome of the need to relate generic continuity to temporal discontinuity period as we have said provides that context but it can only do so according to some organizing principle which must be the work of the historian  p  periods then are not merely convenient collections of years they are thematic categories of time that require substantiation by the historian smith says that nineteenth century institutions carried the creation of periods to an extreme history at that time had been divided chronologically and geographically the chronological arrangement prevailed in ancient and medieval history thereafter    it became primarily geographical  these segments were further divided into periods early modern late modern and sometimes into centuries and even generations for example the age of jackson the civil war reconstruction the progressive era the new deal  pp   nevins decried this use by historians and others of shorthand labels for periods a quite false idea of history is inculcated by such misleading labels as the jacksonian era or the age of theodore roosevelt  p  since they wrongly associate one person personality with the nature of an entire era many other historiographers have denounced the use of labels for periods yet they continue to be commonly used by both historical texts and the general public note for example the popular american obsession with recent decadesthe fifties the sixtiesdespite the arbitrary nature of these chronological boundaries in terms of the social and political events with which they are associated noting the received view that historians should concentrate on problems and not on periods spitz nonetheless does not believe that periodization is itself a problem for historians know full well that any division of time into carefully defined periods is merely a convenient device for conceptualization  p  spitz goes on to say that braudel  observed that historians first create concepts then glue labels on their precious bottles and end up giving the labels authority over their contents but it is not true of the major periods that historians have arbitrarily concocted labels a certain notion of the meaning of an age is born usually in the minds of the elite of the time or of the time immediately succeeding the meaning is discussed argued simplified reduced to a formula a phrase a term and is then adopted by the historians canonized in their books and institutionalized in university curricula  p  we may conclude from this discussion that we would expect the following kinds of categories in the work of historians chronological divi

 the library quarterly approaches discussed by both classification theorists and historical methodologists how do historians decide what to study historical research has been described as a dialogue between the scholar and the sources fabian believes that we can assume that the library allows the scholar to bring together highly complex configurations of texts but otherwise believes that very little is known about the ways in which research in the humanities is carried out  pp   line  takes a similar view he says that the origins of research projects as well as the research activities that follow are often serendipitous humanists often give vague answers to the question why do you study what you study researchers line says are often hazy about how they go about their work uva  noted that his respondents tended to provide answers like previous research or thinking about historical problems when describing what led them into particular research projects kaplan  also stresses the individualized and subjective processes that make up research in which intuition and imagination play important roles researchers do not proceed in a lock step fashion from topic development through background reading searches of indexes and catalogs then reading articles and books they find in this way rather they have a great deal of background knowledge of both literature and people monitor a continuous flow of information from various sources and have developed their owm large bibliographic files based on footnotes and bibliographies in the primary literature the logic of their work is reconstructed afterward in an idealized fashion reflecting a highly rationalized process that may not have actually taken place the same pattern has been found in studies of laboratory scientists for example m in which the actual behaviors seen by observers differ significantly from the textbook descriptions of research that scientists usually provide when interviewed only a few historians in this study were very specific about their choice of topics most traced their choices to their continuing interests or to reading while others cited instances in which an exchange with a colleague led them to explore a topic for example one respondent described the choice of a topic as a response to reading something that appeared suspicious in some way you look at something you read it then you say ow wait a minute this can possibly be true where did you get those assumptions he advocated history as a series of challenges to existing points of view about past events and to a dialogue with other historians another historian criticized his colleagues for being both narrow and too bounded by time in their focus many of them
use of information by historians  find their problem in the age of jackson and burrow into it never looking at other topics or periods as a way of gaining perspective on their own specialty several respondents in this study claimed that there are two different kinds of approaches in historical work first there is a broad level at which the historian looks at a problem in a new way what one respondent described as pathbreaking whether the historian is right or wrong about his thesis is a separate issue but the key thing is that it encourages further study and promotes responses from other historians an example might be the controversial work of stanley elkins on the effects of slavery the second type of approach is narrower as when historians conduct a solid study of a particular community documenting a problem in some depth this sort of micro history often follows up on the more theoretical type of scholarship described above this kind of macrolevel versus microlevel characterization of historical research is also found in many of the works of historical methodology mentioned above as when page smith  discusses symbolic history as something that exists at a higher level than actual events and the sources in which they are recorded one respondent in this study argued that the microlevel of history had proceeded too far under the influence of the social sciences he emphasized the value of the old narrative history over the more recent approaches that have produced microcosms of knowledge that no one seems willing to put together the social sciences according to this historian encouraged the type of research question that could be answered by common sense as an example he described the work of a colleague who investigated the fate of artisans during the industrial revolution following much investigation of work records family histories and demographic data he found the obvious answer that many artisans had gone to work in the newly built factories among the questions asked were how historians choose particular topics and how they pursued them described here are contrasting case studies of three respondents in the interests of maintaining the anonymity of the respondents some details of their projects such as the names of the persons whose biographies they have written are not supplied here the first historian a senior professor has been writing a biography of an early black civil rights leader and other nineteenth century black people his project represents two decades of research that began when he was encouraged to choose a civil war topic for his dissertation but didn like what he saw his doctoral advisor then suggested that he take a look at this negro who was once a congressman from virginia personal involvement with the civil rights movement added fuel to his

use of information by historians  very very widely he says but complains that no one is indexing records with my projects in mind scholar number two does not rely completely on the traditional methods and sources of the historian his topic which is stated as a research question his sources and his varied methods reflect the increasing influence of the social sciences in the historian craft the third historian describes his specialty as late nineteenth century    but more topically than chronologically he is working on a biography of a popular nineteenth century writer of history whose book jackets proclaimed him as america greatest historian this project grew out of his doctoral dissertation which came to me because i love junk shops and old book stores and flea markets and auctions and i kept seeing his books showing up in these shops and clearly someone paid a lot of money in the late nineteenth century to purchase those volumes and yet when you began to look around in academic libraries you didn see much of that author and that led me to thinking  there must be a whole field of what was important to people at one time that for a variety of reasons didn get into academic libraries in the late nineteenth century because of his interests he spends a lot of time looking for evidence of popular tastes and ideology in the objects and documents of the time he continues to prowl in museums and second hand shops collecting the many old volumes toys and household objects that decorate his crowded office this historian feels that popular culture is often overlooked by historians and that his colleagues ought to pay more attention to pulp fiction museums and folk collections of objects common to the period under study he advocates the use of instinct as a guide to finding a study topic your best research questions are probably formulated by your life experiences this scholar may be an example of rundell claim  that historians tend to proceed from sources to topics yet what was available in the archives did not seem to dictate a topic for most of these respondents they claimed to be following questions that led them to sources rather than the other way around what do historians do when they study history stoan  has made the point that what is secondary and tertiary to the scholar is primary to the librarian that is the books bibliographic databases and reference tools that we painstakingly provide are not the source materials that scholars most often seek reliance upon original evidence is especially important to historians who make a strong distinction between primary and secondary material for the historian the primary material is to be found in the archives just about every con
 the library quarterly ceivable type of material was mentioned by these respondents books articles manuscripts magazines newspapers statistical reports wills deeds diaries letters films photographs portraits architectural drawings buildings toys and so on the scholars interviewed here were asked to describe the types and locations of material important to their work several respondents described their use of primary sources as the heart of what they do arranging the time and circumstances for access to sources was critical part of it is that primary source access is more difficult than secondary source access so if i get a microfilm ie got  number of weeks to return it and it is a pain in the butt to get it back again so i try to be very thorough the first time around one respondent noted that reading articles involves less writing in many ways than reading primary sources because it is easier for him to keep a copy to examine at his leisure another historian said that he would take down quoted material as it strikes me given the variety of questions and ideas that are swimming in my head that the easy part the hard part comes later sitting down with all these things and trying to figure out all that ie got there the respondents mentioned a bewildering number of libraries and archives that contained materials of interest to them the most commonly mentioned was the library of congress but virtually all of the major academic libraries were mentioned by one historian or another several of them also used libraries outside of the country primarily in england such as the diplomatic historian who spent an entire academic year visiting british libraries interlibrary loan ill was mentioned by a few as one way of obtaining source materials the ill policies and procedures were of particular import to these historians one respondent described an ill request for newspapers from the s that he thought would bring him a few pages of microfiche to his surprise it arrived in the form of many boxes of actual newspapers historians typically expressed a preference for working with original copies of materials but seemed resigned to using microform copies of most things once they had made their notes and photocopies historians returned to their offices to organize them fifteen of these historians organized their documents and notes primarily by topic of those fifteen historians ten chose to arrange or index their material by period or event either in combination with topical categories or as a secondary level two historians said they organized their material strictly chronologically and another one by topic within periods the remaining two historians said they organized their materials solely by author name twelve of the historians maintained an index of their books and articles but typically only for those materials that were relevant to a current
use of information by historians  writing project several reported having tried to keep a record of all their materials but giving up after it proved to involve too much effort one has used computers to collect citations to thousands of documents over a period of years but changed software several times in the process as he found better packages and computers this strategy led to having citations in several incompatible formats rather than in one centralized collection a further discussion of the organization of these historians files and the implications for design of computerized systems can be found in case  although they often mentioned periods especially centuries and decades none of these historians claimed to organize their files in this manner as is seen elsewhere in this article however several did use chronology date or year but rarely a chronology of years in their filing and writing the use of technological aids to research was also discussed in the interviews while it is a common point of view that scholars fear computers this attitude was not evident among the respondents in this study all but three of the twenty historians used a computer in some aspect of their work the average years of computer usage was about  years at the time of the survey that is most of the respondents had started using computers about  or  but at least one respondent had been using a microcomputer for as long as eight years beginning with a now ancient radio shack trs  model one the type of application common to all of the historians was word processing but respondents varied in the degree to which computers were integrated into their writing habits virtually all continued to edit manuscripts primarily on paper and several still produced initial drafts by hand some used their personal computer only for certain tasks for example one historian who was new to computers used his only for shorter documents such as letters he continued to use a typewriter for documents of more than three pages historians are beginning to change the ways in which they record notes some respondents reported transcribing their hand written notes into their personal computer often adding further notes in the process one respondent reported using a portable laptop computer and several others expressed interest in using such devices in the future to avoid unnecessary transcriptions that might introduce errors in addition to word processing five historians reported using a personal computer for database applications such as bibliographical or statistical records or to perform statistical analyses these tended to be the social and economic historians none of these historians reported the use of any bibliographic databases even indirectly unexpectedly another technical innovation is credited with signifi
 the library quarterly cantly changing the way that historians operate it is not databases or information retrieval or even computers in general those means of creating storing and retrieving electronic copies of text have just begun to affect the way historians work rather it is the photocopier a means of creating physical copies of documents that has most affected the work of the historian the influence of the photocopier was a development first noted by rundell two decades ago  yet the appearance of this technical innovation is still fresh in the minds of older historians unprompted by the investigator a quarter of the respondents in this study mentioned the role of photocopiers in their research before copiers became common in archives and libraries historians spent hours taking notes and transcribing materials by hand now they tend to photocopy all but the briefest portions of primary material in archives the ability to photocopy depends upon the project and place involved for example one historian felt that the library of congress makes copying difficult at some sites it is simply very expensive fabian has characterized the lack of adequate reprographic facilities as a barrier to historical research there is hardly any library which supplies photographic work within a reasonable period of time so that in many cases the researcher is thrown back on simple note taking  p  in a way photocopying has increased the difficulties that historians encounter in processing relevant materials since it makes it easy to collect documents without necessarily absorbing them through close reading and note taking how do historians write historians reported a variety of individualistic methods of turning their notes and other materials into a draft of an original work for example one historian described how he would literally physically organize these notes    here for the introduction and there for section one and here for section two that could be done in a variety of ways either by hand or in a computer file the hard part is just that moment of reading through the material and thinking hat can i use of all the things youe written down but where the big step    is to come up with a final outline and to organize things on the basis of that outline and the outline is continually changing sort of like a back and forth act writing the first drafts of a document may be the first point at which a scholar reaches a holistic understanding of the topic for example one historian described the process by which he organizes his material in this fashion i not necessarily sure of what the categories are until i see the lay of the land on the project itself so i may start off by
use of information by historians  saying that i want to do something on labor and the movies but what exactly i not absolutely sure so the easiest thing to do when you start off    is to put things chronologically usually it is when i have to write either a grant proposal or an article that i    go through all the cards and create the categories as i going along a few historians described elaborate rituals that they carry out in the preparation of manuscripts one uses a box of index cards for writing in which each card lists a book citation the library call number and an arbitrarily assigned sequence number that can substitute for authorand year he later uses these to make lists of references relevant content in these books he notes in a small notebook while reading the material then he later collapses his list of relevant materials onto paper using the sequence numbers as references to the original sources let say i writing a chapter  il take out a piece of paper and write down those subjects that seem to be related along with the source numbers then il go to the box of sources and pull out all the sources that i need for that chapter then il read through all the sources and maybe refine the subject content of the sources then il start to sequence it   in what kind of order il be putting this material then il just start writing sometimes il get carried away and maybe hit on some good scheme and not really follow the sequence after ie read through all the source material again i can make another sheet that is more refined with more topics and page numbers sometimes il find out in writing that i just don have the information that i need to develop some topics and il go back and do some more research to find it the latter comment is a good illustration of the back and forth nature of this kind of scholarship a laboratory scientist once she begins to write up the findings of an experiment would not generally go back and run the experiment again but the historian in writing will often find that expression of what is known brings into focus that which is not known prompting a trip back to the source material another historian used cards in a similar fashion in writing then when i get ready to write i go through the cards and i reorganize them into categories    i don start to write until i see what it looks like then it easy for me to go through the cards and put them in what i can see are going to be the sections of either a book or an article james axtell  has written an essay history as imagination in which he declares that much of historical work involves imagining people and situations one of these respondents agreed saying that imagination permits an historian to better intuit behavior   seeing actors as having some volition rather than as passive objects another historian described his writings on working class life in cincinnati with the comment i had to give life to those times   a sense of passion because otherwise he would feel that his work was false there is no such thing
 the library quarterly as empirical truth he continued there is no such thing as empirical reality it is all a construction in a dialogue between what the author has gotten out of his primary sources and what he or she does to reconceive or reconceptualize it and that is an act of imagination on the role of literary style one historian made this observation despite all my forays into social science i still think of myself as a humanist i still admire historians who have a literary flair not for its own sake but because it is a better way to communicate it is the principal advantage that historians have in communicating with a wider audience another historian said simply in my field the subject and the expression are so inextricably intertwined that they cannot really be separated summary and conclusions historians librarians and even psychologists have written about the ways in which historical knowledge is organized and used since few scholars have written about how historical knowledge is created the present investigation was undertaken the purpose was to understand how a sample of historians chose their topics proceeded with their research and went about their writing historians in this study pursued a variety of research topics while sometimes vague about their motivations these historians said that they chose their topics based largely on past interests often pertaining to their graduate education and sometimes also to their personal circumstances or interpersonal contacts their investigations were guided less by sources and more by questions or problems that led them to particular sources in investigating their topics the historians interviewed here were guided by conceptualizations of their topic that were expressed in sets of categories semihierarchical labels for certain phenomena that served to organize their notes and manuscripts virtually all respondents used computers in some aspects of their writing habits of composition were idiosyncratic but typically featured the sequencing of topics and notes into a linear andor hierarchical order appropriate for the type of document being composed the present investigation has some commonalities with earlier studies of historians work habits especially the unpublished works by uva  and orbach  uva critical incident study of twenty two historians found the majority of historians to be in either data collection or writing rewriting stages at the time of contact yet the present investigation suggest that stages are illusory choosing and refining topics planning and conducting studies gathering and interpreting evidence
use of information by historians  and writing and revising manuscripts can go on concurrently both within and across individual projects as uva eventually admits the present investigation does not support uva conclusion that historians research procedures are largely serendipitous a finding also suggested by steig  and stone  this study found historians to be wellorganized and methodical in their research also not supported is uva notion that historians choice of research topic is unrelated to interpersonal sources of information several respondents in the present investigation reported that colleagues had played key roles in the formulation of research questions especially earlier in their careers as orbach  notes there is an invisible college at work among historians particularly for exchanging knowledge of archival sources implications for libraries and for further research history may be less well served by classification and indexing than any other academic field libraries and bibliographk tools are designed for those who are unfamiliar or only partly familiar with the knowledge they seek the accomplished scholar and particularly the historian is not often aided by the disciplinary boundaries that library classification schemes enforce the needs of historians present a dilemma to the librarian karl weintraub has said that in buying and cataloging materials the librarian cannot neglect the fact that many of his users are subject oriented and that disciplines exist as organized bodies of knowledge but when the librarian struggles with    how his library is being used and how it could be used more effectively then the problemoriented model of knowledge may be the much more significant one to hold to  p  it is this problem oriented model that we must consider in devising tools and services for historians not the disciplinary model of a body of knowledge subdivided by place and period while we cannot easily reorder our archives and library collections we may be able to bridge them through special services and tools for the scholar studies of terminology used in academic specialties might result in guides to translate the terms of one specialist for example a symbolic anthropologist into words and examples familiar to another kind of specialist for example a social historian wiberley  gives us the example of realism as a term that can vary widely in meaning and may require such treatment future research might develop ways to index the aspect of literature called comment by bella hass weinberg in her essay why indexing fails the researcher  that is how can an index reflect the point of view or ontext that is so often the central concern in discussions
 the library quarterly of historical problems relatedly tibbo  offers empirical evidence in favor of a new style of abstract for reporting historical research her research suggests that historical abstracts need to describe not only elements of time geographicpolitical units and topic but also names of individuals and social groups descriptions of the author thesis and arguments and the primary sources used in the investigation finally electronic mail and computer bulletin boards might be exploited to facilitate the exchange of information among historians archivists and librarians about the location and use of source materials the formation of invisible colleges could in this way be encouraged and librarians and archivists could more easily become part of them to employ a problem oriented model of information services we must focus our studies of information needs and uses more closely on the behaviors of specific communities of scholars most studies of the information behavior of historians for example tell us only about the use of libraries and specific types of materials and they inform us using our own jargon not that of the scholar if we are to serve scholars better we could benefit from a deeper understanding of their work than can be gained by questions about the use of books journals and indexes questions that are often biased in the direction of current practices the present study attempted to elicit from scholars descriptions of their work that will aid us in understanding their use of information the key to understanding scholarly information needs and their use of libraries archives databases and indexes lies in further probing of their specific activities we need in depth studies of particular groups of scholars much narrower than the vague collections of humanists studied elsewhere and narrower even than the varied american historians examined here a more manageable focus would be something on the order of social historians of the united states an in depth approach to understanding information needs and uses presents difficult methodological hurdles however interviews are timeconsuming and are based on unreliable self reports of thought motivation and action while thought and motivation are difficult to study outside of personal interaction with the scholar actions may be studied in a variety of ways it is therefore advisable to couple interviews with examinations of artifacts of behavior such as notes files publications and citations and where possible actual observation of scholars at work the study by tibbo  for example merges interview and questionnaire data with an analysis of samples of historical abstracts to arrive at specific recommendations for optimal abstracting of historical work it is by bringing a variety of research methods to bear on a particular
