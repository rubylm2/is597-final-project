th e library quarterkly volume xxii april  number  the cultural function of the library pierce butler d ifferences are always more conspicuous than resemblances this is true of human activities as well as of physical objects for example it is easier to see the peculiarities of librarianship than those characteristics that it shares with every other learned profession in the same way an attempt to define the cultural function of the library will turn out to be chiefly the problem of identifying traits that are common to many cultural functions accordingly the present inquiry must start at a point which may at first seem unnecessarily remote from its issue i what is culture in general and what does it do factual answers to these questions are easy historically a culture is the mode of life that a particular people has developed and standardized structurally it is a complex of physical social and intellectual components practically it is the means whereby man copes with nature but all such statements merely enumerate data pertinent to the problem they explain nothing instead they are so indeterinuate that all sorts of fallacious cultural theories have been based upon them thus in the present scientistic age culture is commonly regarded as the behavior of man as a zoological species but this definition is only pseudoscientific its terms misrepresent the things they refer to and in combination they propound a falsehood with respect to his mode of living man is not zoblogical for most of his activities are biologically irrelevant again when men are classified by their cultures they form not one species but many and correspondingly because man activities so frequently involve repression of conditioned reflexes the term behavior with its modern connotations cannot be applied to them conduct is  more accurate description moreover the total proposition stated in these erroneous terms is itself an error culture instead of being merely the servant of man is in many ways his master under any naturalistic hypothesis the most distinctive characteristics of culture remain inexplicable it is true that man fabricates his living routines out of the materials and forces of nature but he does so voluntarily not under any natural compulsion even in civilization individuals or whole nations may if they choose slough off their 
 the library quarterly culture and revert to bestiality as recent history and current news abundantly testify yet culture this purely optional human artificiality comes to life under the hands of the men who make it escapes their control and assumes dominion over them in many ways it resembles a biological organism it persists through time while the generations in which it incorporates itself appear and vanish its development is distinctly embryological the simple becomes complex uniformity turns into diversity not at haphazard but in directional movement toward an order as yet nonexistent the end product differs completely from the origin and both from all intermediate phases men do things for personal and empirical reasons but culture turns their deeds to ends that the doers of them neither foresaw nor intended for instance out of the pooled book funds of a neighborhood civilization has elaborated its present library system similarly all cultural activities have a strong physiological cast the farm the bank and the factory co operate organically with railroads for arteries electric wires for nerves and money for enzymes culture is in the world yet not of it although culture cannot transcend the limits of nature it alters nature in every particular including mankind itself every human being is a creature of culture while the animal lives by the instinctive behaviors of its species man lives by acquired racial routines the phrase man in a state of nature is self contradictory man becomes human only as he departs from nature the most primitive people actually known to anthropology have already  the tern race is used here in its historical not in its genealogical sense a distinction that for the weal and woe of mankind is too seldom observed departed so far that even an adult among them could not long survive without the aid of cultural ideas artifacts and co operations his instincts have become so vestigial that uncontrolled they produce only disastrous reactions from lowest savagery to highest civilization man lives in by and for culture in culture man moves through realms of experience that no animal can enter rational consciousness of himself of nature and of values thus he ceases to be merely a denizen of the world and becomes an agent in it although he cannot make anything out of nothing he can rearrange the content of his environment to produce things that without him could have no existence in this sense he is truly creative he remakes the world to his liking but he is a judge as well as a creator he appraises and evaluates every thing and event by cultural standards hence being at once a creator and a judge man must needs be an artist he makes and does things whereby he can attain value experiences ranging all the way from homely utility to the subtlest aesthetic moral and intellectual refinements in culture likewise man finds his highest aspirations and his deepest loyalties by a good life or happiness he means a mode of living in which material social and intellectual values can be experienced together in their greatest purity variety and intensity and in the last analysis man inmost compulsions are cultural what he calls his self respect altruism and patriotism are not really directed to himself his fellows and posterity as persons but to the kind of life they shall lead and the values they shall cherish thus from every point of view
the cultural function of the library i man humanity and culture are ultranatural both are artificial in the sense that man will and not the cosmos produces them the one cannot exist without the other each is at once the original and the derivative man evokes culture out of the latent possibilities of nature and culture evokes humanity out of the latent possibilities of man paradoxically however man can produce culture only to the extent that he has already become human and he can become human only to the extent that he is already culturalized yet humanity and culture are not identical or even different aspects of the same thing they are as distinct as a bird and its nest ii every culture high or low is a complex or physical social and intellectual components which without straining the terms may here be called equipment organization and scholarship these coexist not in mere aggregate but in organic integration so that each component at once supports and is supported by the others without suitable artifacts men cannot carry their cooperations or thought very far equipment and scholarship must remain rudimentary in the absence of civil order and even the best goods and customs are useless if men do not understand their structure operation and purpose the modern mind seems unable to recognize the pluralistic character of culture and habitually confuses the whole with one or another of its components thus modern eastern europeans consistently identify civilization with material equipment while we westerners commonly equate it with social organization we constantly say society when we mean culture and democracy when we mean civilization and by the same prejudice we think we can trace back to social origins not only houses and tools but even morality and consciousness such vagaries are plausible because every cultural activity involves the social but false because it involves at the same time and in equal measure the physical and the intellectual iii the basic processes of culture are plainly the production distribution and use of human artificialities these processes however are secular properly speaking no single generation performs them in its own lifetime but a race of men operating through centuries and though the performance may be spontaneous and at times automatic it is not inevitable even when it is unconscious culture remains voluntary and hence variable but freedom to do a thing necessarily carries freedom not to do it or to do something different consequently despite historic pressures people are always at liberty to stand still advance or retreat culturally and even by misuse of culture to win negative instead of positive values distress failure and nisery instead of ease success and happiness every cultural process becomes more complex as culture advances but in our own civilization these complexities ut this is only a particular manifestation of a general monistic trend in modern thought that is no doubt historically inevitable western avilization has lately accomplished so much by analysis induction and geneticism that almost instinctively it seeks by the same methods the unity that rationality requires accordingly it endeavors to reduce all experience to one kind only but this is unnecessary unity appears as often in union as in uniformity the many can become one by synthesis all the varied routines of a people coalesce in culture just as all the diversities of culture and nature unite in the theistic universe
 the library quarterly are generally understood in only two of the three components of culture economists have long since explored and explained the ramifications of our production distribution and utilization of material goods somewhat less thoroughly sociologists have done the same for our social organizations but this cannot be said of our scholarship here our ideas are usually less discriminating than our vocabulary the production of ideas for instance we call research in science invention in technology and study in humanity without recognizing the implications of the verbal distinctions we are making but this semantic anomaly is only typical of our general indifference to all the processes of scholarship so long as we can keep busy in practice we are content to renmain unsophisticated in theory in fact it might almost be said that only the scientistic and pseudoscientific among us concern themselves greatly over what they call methodology but this as these people develop it is markedly unrealistic tendentious and stultifying this state of affairs however is as perilous as it is unnecessary scholarship like every other concentration of power is potentially dangerous uncontrolled it resembles its social or physical analogue a mob or a runaway engine ideas mishandled may be lethal the devil can quote scripture to his purpose no lie is so false as a tissue of carefully selected truths by every count then the intellectual component of civilization like its equipment and organization may be safely handled only by men who understand it but in the case of scholarship this should not be too difficult the basic processes are by no means recondite anyone can easily discover from his own intellectual experience their major forms and ruling principles and this as a matter of fact is all that will be attempted in the following analysis iv man gets his ideas from two sources his own experience and the experience of others of these the first may be primary but practically the second is the more important without communicated experience man can hardly become rational whether a real tarzan deprived of all human contacts from infancy could attain even a rudimentary intelligence may be debatable but certainly under normal circumstances the individual as boy and man depends more on communicated than on direct experience for his intellectual development he listens more often to the voices of his fellows than to the sounds of nature he sees farther and more clearly through other people eyes than through his own and his thoughts for the most part and for the best part are rarely original but no experience by itself induces a corresponding idea in the human mind an awareness becomes conscious only as it is identified by reference to prior awarenesses scholarship is a cumulation of ideas that are not merely added together but linked with each other by recognitions of likeness and difference this fact appears clearly in language which is a mode of thought as well as a medium of communication every verb and common noun generalizes into a species all identical experiences that taken singly could be known only by historical methodology for example commonly deals only with the formation of historical ideas and neglects or ignores their diffusion and application furthermore it is pseudoscientific and consists largely of big names for little things and doctrinary criteria that would condemn the work of every great historian
the cultural function of the library  proper names similarly every adjective and adverb is an abstraction of a common quality from dissimilar experiences and in exactly the same way the compacted ideas thus induced by sets of primary experiences become themselves secondary experiences that consolidate into still higher generalizations and abstractions but for either of these processes to occur both experience and thought must accumulate and for this the past must virtually project itself into a continuous present now the only place on earth where that can happen is a human consciousiness but even there the possibilities of nature must be culturally exploited man memory will produce mere reverie instead of recollection unless cultural discipline compels it to be selective in both its formation and its operation in the most serious connection a child or a subnormal adult will retain and recall irrelevant details that a mature person would not remember at all or would not notice if he did for ideas to crystallize into scholarship there must be selective rejection as well as preservation scholarship however is more than a permanent body of selected ideas that have been integrated with each other from these ideas in their totality there emanates a common sense or synoptic meaning but in this as in every other particular human thought is quite different from what most modern treatises on psychology logic and epistemology make it these doubly oversimplify first they isolate each intellectual activity and then they reject its content and context so as to leave only the empty process for consideration this procedure however is wholly unrealistic man cannot think without thinking of something and to some purpose but current academic opinion explicitly or implicitly denies this it regards each idea as a simple unitary reaction thought as a linear sequence of such reactions and scholarship as a network of channels through which these chain reactions flow in reality every idea is a whole constellation of simultaneous awarenesses that form the galaxy of scholarship by their overlapping roughly speaking then three phases may be distinguished in the production of scholarship experience induces corresponding ideas in the human mind there they are selectively correlated and preserved and out of the whole emerges an over all meaning or synoptic significance for a culture to exist its scholarship must be diffused in living minds and for the culture to endure that scholarship must be transmitted from generation to generation actually however both results are produced by the same operation every normal community consists of young middle aged and old in an animal it is not a conscious recognition of past experience that persists but only the physiological effect of past experience but neural reflexes conditioned by past experience are no more conscious recognitions of memory than are those conditioned by heredity the instincts  our certainty that the sun will rise tomorrow morning is a good example of such a synopsis this is not as is often asserted a statistical inference from the uniformity of all past occurrences on the contrary it is the common sense of all we know concerning mathematics physics and astronomy in this connection  even under the artificial conditions of a psychological laboratory the content of a human consciousness cannot be reduced to a single awareness as for example of a particular color although all the accompanying elements of normal experience eg form size texture may be eliminated the subject will be marginally aware of their absence and of many other things such as the preliminaries of the experiment and its apparent purpose
 the library quarterly people living together consequently any idea disseminated today will persist through the lifetime of the youngest person now receiving it but in the meantime he will have communicated it to other persons as yet unborn who will carry it in the same way into a more distant future of the various means by which ideas pass from mind to mind demonstrative action is the simplest because every cultural act corresponds to ideas in the mind of the person who does it the performance itself may induce the same ideas in the mind of an attentive onlooker that a child obtains much of its first scholarship by watching the activities of its elders is generally recognized but the extent to which adults depend on example for the same purpose is less often noticed yet many humanistic ideas must be thus transmitted and much of our technological lore can be taught only as we say on the job but in all such cases the demonstrative acts are usually accompanied by oral comments and explanations these involve language which is the commonest method for the communication of ideas but speech also is demonstrative action though of a symbolic instead of an operative character as such it is more comprehensive and effective than example by it a person not only can explain what he is doing at the moment but can also expound his memories of the past and his designs on the future including in every case both his primary ideas and their intellectual and emotional derivatives but just as speech goes beyond example in the diffusion of ideas so literature improves upon language the exact point where a linguistic communication becomes literary may be indefinable but that the latter is a distinct and superior method is proved by its early appearance in cultural evolution every primitive people has an oral literature of an extent and variety that always surprises the beginner in anthropology this is composed of traditional texts in each of which a group of interrelated ideas have been crystallized as these texts are recited over and over again every one in the community will come to know them and can refer to them in his memory when occasion requires a particular idea thus recorded furthermore all these primitive oral literatures already use both the fundamental literary forms factual description and fictional representation the first deals chiefly with the kind of ideas that are here called scientific and technological and it communicates them directly it describes literally the recognitions induced in a human mind by things and events the parallel fictional literature however has a totally different character for the most part it incorporates humanistic ideas and it communicates them by implication a fable for example talks about animals but it tells of men and women it describes characters that never lived and events that never happened not to deceive but to impart he transition from language to literature corresponds exactly to similar transitions in cultural equipment and organization an artifact becomes beautiful when its form induces a secondary experience of value beyond the primary one of utility a deed likewise becomes noble when benevolence as well as justice is recognizable in it and just so a text becomes literary when it evokes a double awareness not only of the ideas incorporated in it but of the precision force and grace of its language  even in our own highly graphic culture there is at least one example of such oral literature everyone knows and uses the jingle thirty days hath september yet practically all of us learned it not from a book but by hearing other people recite it
the cultural function of the library  common sense and worldly wisdom and finally all cultures have a current as well as a traditional literature oratory and debate are well developed even among barbarians by means of them the community not only thinks as it were corporately but it likewise diffuses the content of the group mind among all its members to produce what we know as public opinion thus in the distribution of scholarship there are likewise three major methods some ideas are diffused by operative action others by language and still others by literature scholarship serves many masters and for many purposes along with equipment and organization culture uses it to maintain itself the race to exploit its environment and the individual to attain personal satisfactions hence from every point of view the sole norm of scholarship is its utility since in the last analysis it is but one of the means whereby men achieve experience of value therefore any scholarship must be relative to the whole culture of which it is one component but on this point modern thought is confused by its failure to distinguish between truth and scholarship a scholarship is merely the intellectual content of a particular culture at a particular time truth is the limit which all scholarship approaches as culture advances thus though truth is absolute scholarship varies in the lower stages of cultural evolution the system of ideas whereby men conduct themselves rationally may consist largely of falsehoods and even in a high civilization where intellectual progress is rapid as among ourselves in the fields of science and technology the scholarly certainties of today may be rejected as delusions tomorrow a scholarship is relative not only to the level of cultural development at which it occurs but also to the material on which it operates and the people who use it it may be applied only to a specific field and by particular persons indeed scholarship may become a liability instead of an asset when it is separated from corresponding activities certainly this happens whenever a professional man is compelled by adverse circumstances to engage in unskilled manual labor because his scholarship is irrelevant to his work it will hinder instead of help him but even more humanly disastrous will be his cultural frustration the professional ideas that occupy his mind press vainly for realization in experience and although the loss to the community may be infinitesimal in any individual case it is real for if such maladjustments become common all its routines of living must deteriorate in use scholarship is also indivisible since every cultural activity involves a material a method and a motive the scholarship necessary for its performance must also be triple and include a science a technology and a humanity of corresponding sorts this principle does not preclude intensive specialization by various individuals in each of these branches or even in tiny segments of them so long as all the branches are adequately utilized and the community integrates the results of  but the relativity and historicity of scholarship have no significance whatever for the character or function of truth they cannot impugn its finality or make it utilitarian indeed the usefulness of an idea depends less on its verity than on its conformity to the ideas by which it is surrounded each period has its intellectual no less than its linguistic idiom and can use no other a premature idea like mendel theory formerly or a belated one like astrology today is practically nonexistent for current scholarship
 the library quarterly these diverse activities but as civilization rises the maintenance of such an equilibrium becomes ever more difficult history teems with examples of cultural disasters wrought by monistic scholarships in which science technology or humanity was used alone instead of in combination with the others to be useful a scholarship must observe concurrently factual realities operative possibilities and humanistic imperatives a third requirement of scholarship in operation is that it must have a substance as well as a form theoretically the opposite may seem possible indeed there have been periods when it was generally believed that all man needs to live rationally is a valid intellectual method with this he should be able to meet every occasion as it arises identify the significant facts and devise the necessary procedure to accomplish what he desires but this theory has never worked out in practice the verbalisms of greek sophists the dialectics of medieval schoolmen the rationalisms of the enlightenment the ideologies of modern totalitarians and the objectivities of current scientism have all proved culturally defective to attaim and maintain cultural values man must use a scholarship that has a content as well as a form sheer intellectualism without sound learning to back it is futile in sum then the utilization of scholarship imvolves these basic principles a scholarship must be relevant to its field and agents it must include scientific technological and humanistic components and it must have a material as well as a method the utilitarian norms of scholarship are therefore relativity integrity and substantiality v from the standpoint of scholarship cultural evolution falls into three major phases each of which is inaugurated by a particular invention language advances man from bestiality to savagery literature raises him to barbarism and writing elevates him to civilization but each of these inventions is only a variant of the same basic process that of projecting ideas from the human consciousness into external forms so that they can be manipulated more freely in speech ideas are only momentarily incorporated in vocal sounds in literature as tradition they endure as long as the culture and in books they attain all but immortality but as the fixation becomes more permanent every process of scholarship is also extended and refined with speech man enlarges greatly the horizon of his indirect experiences in space time and scope through the spoken words of his fellows he can see places that he has never visited participate in events that happened before his birth and detect behind the stolidity of his companions their personal feelings and language likewise plays an important part in both the diffusion of scholarship and its co operative application when literarv form is added to lan our prohibition experiment illustrates the fallacy of exclusive factual realism it failed because it ignored the possibilities of enforcement and the inevitable human reactions our former attempt at world govemment and apparently the present one exemplify the corresponding technological error cultural advance cannot be achieved by merely devising a process without regard for the material which it must use and the ends to which it may be diverted and finaly totalitarianism in all its forms demonstrates the folly of replacing both science and technique with counterfeits crudely wrought in desire for convenience the term writing will here be used to include every graphic process and book for every kind of graphic record
the cultural function of the library  guage each of these facilities is carried still further but it is only with writimg that they reach their highest powers civilized man makes constant use of graphic methods and by them achieves results otherwise impossible with pencil and paper the scientist works out abstruse relationships beyond the ken of his mental calculations with drawing instruments the engineer devises mechanical complications and precisions that by shop methods alone would be impracticable and by writings the humanist disentangles evaluations and arguments from the confusions of mere meditation but it is probably as an extension of the capacity precision and permanence of the human memory that writing contributes most to the formation of scholarship for example no mathematician or world of mathematicians could possibly memorize a table of logarithms but a book can remember the whole thing without the error of a single digit and do it practically forever furthermore every book has a total significance that differs in kind from the sum of its elements even a merchant bill establishes the monetary indebtedness of his customer by enumerating the transactions through which he incurred it and at the other extreme every treatise or work of fiction induces over all synoptic ideas in the mind of its reader in the communication of ideas also writing increases and multiplies the powers of language a speaker can be heard only as far as his voice will carry and while he is speaking a writer reach through time and space is unlimited in oral form an idea can pass from generation to generation only if the chain of transmission remains continuous with the failure of a single link it is lost irrevocably but in graphic form an idea can lie dormant almost interminably without dying inscribed clay tablets have lately communicated to living minds the ideas of the ancient mesopotamians after millenniums in which no man knew them or even the language and script in which they are written with writing literature the third method of communication also increases its earlier powers and develops new ones conditions that formerly occurred only occasionally are now continuous the listener need no longer wait upon the bard in person to hear his lay the community now sits as it were in permanent assembly and listens without confusion to the arguments of a thousand orators speaking simultaneously in formal graphic texts a culture is always and everywhere virtually aware of the whole content of its mind it likewise develops in the silent discourse of the book rhetorical refinements and literary devices beyond the scope of the spoken word indeed the differentiation is now carried so far that every literate person requires three concentric vocabularies for use respectively when he speaks writes and reads but perhaps the most astonishing advance produced by writing occurs in factual literature which now includes nonlinguistic records as well as verbal texts maps pictures tables and diagrams on which ideas are immediately projected instead of passing through an intermediate translation into language in the use of scholarship no less than in its production and diffusion graphic symbols excel oral discourse in every way more especially they liberalize the laws that make the cultural use of scholarship depend upon its relativity integrity and substantiality books allow a man to engage more freely in
 the library quarterly intellectual activities irrelevant to his vocation without diminishing his cultural efficiency or his personal happiness they likewise reduce the penalties imposed on the citizen and the community for breaking the unity of scholarship books abet the individual in specializing intellectually to the very verge of monomania but at the same time they aid the community in combining the activities of many such specialists into a normal unity and finally books permit a man to possess scholarship vicariously he can attain much of its substance by acquiring books instead of by study from them he can often take the products of an intellectual discipline that he himself has never mastered indeed in some fields today the scholar bibliographical skill seems only slightly less important than his intelligence vi the book as a typical human artifact exists in two realms of being in the realm of nature it is merely so much matter despite its artificial form it differs by no whit from any other inanimate object all its properties are explicable in terms of chemistry and physics but in the realm of culture a book is something entirely different here it is a system of ideas that has been projected from one human consciousness into a permanent external form capable of reinducing the same ideas in any other human consciousness that makes actual contact with it moreover this power is of a wholly nondynamic character a book produces just as strong an effect on its ten thousandth reader as it did on the first in the realm of nature books do not coalesce with each other in the realm of culture they do volumes whose ideas overlap combine to form a subject literature and all subject literatures to form a literary universe which contains roughly speaking the totality of scholarship reduced to potential form but the universe of ideas is by no means identical with the universe of books in which it is thus stored the two differ at many points in both their formation and their structure in scholarship the elements and pattern of each constellation are fixed by the experience that produces it in a book ideas may be detached from unrelated experiences and arbitrarily recombined to serve the purpose of the author hence the same idea may reappear in many different books but each time in a different setting again scholarship is truly progressive literature merely cumulative when an idea is refuted it becomes nonexistent in scholarship except as a historical fact but in literature it lives on alongside the new idea that contradicts it so long as the books containing it endure and finally the interrelationships of ideas are self revealing those of literature obscure to organize scholarship is comparatively easy to classify books extremely difficult for all these reasons the universe of  the distinctions made here between truth scholarship and literature will perhaps appear more clearly in a specific example the battle of gettysburg was a real event and the truth concerning it is absolute and unalterable but the corresponding scholarship varies at any moment with the data available and the point to which historical investigation has been carried the subject literature however reflects that scholarship only confusedly imperfectly and inaccurately it includes not only monographs dealing specifically with the subject but every history in which the battle is mentioned and every essay novel and poem in which ideas induced by the event are utilized irrespective of whether the opinions presented are mistaken and obsolete or valid and still accepted furthermore no single book in that literature incorporates all its author thoughts on the subject and finally since study must precede publication the subject literature must always be slightly belated
the cultural function of the library  books is a chaos and one of the persistent problems of civilization is how to cope with its superhuman magnitude and disorder millions of texts are already in existence and hundreds of new ones are produced every day all of them are repetitive most of them are obsolete and many of those that are still valid are incompatible with each other for any person to find in the welter those particular volumes that he needs is obviously all but impossible accordingly civilization has developed various devices to facilitate the process the most systematic of these is bibliography which might be defined as the geography of the book world this includes to continue the metaphor not only maps but also guidebooks and travel narratives not only those tabular lists of subjects authors and titles to which the term is usually limited but all histories of literature reviews advertisements comments allusions and references but in all these varied forms bibliography has serious empirical limitations in general it is so technical that only professional bookmen can use it yet even for them it is far from satisfactory if it is exhaustive it tells too much for most purposes if selective too little and worst of all it becomes obsolescent on the day that it goes to the printer of a totally different character but to the same cultural purpose is the book trade this theoretically might be expected to keep every community supplied with the books that its citizens need but practically of course it falls far short of doing so booksellers as a class are not bibliographical experts furthermore to perform their cultural office they must pay themselves wages on behalf of the community in the form of profits but to do this they must rely chiefly on mass demand and supply and in either case ignore the unusual and the special in part these limitations are overcome by the development of an international mail order market with the world instead of the local community as his public a dealer can concentrate on a particular subject literature however recondite and still make a living but even at the best although he thus raises demand to profitable dimensions and although he draws upon other dealers to replenish his stock his problem of supply is already critical and every year becomes progressively more so the world increase in population and in literacy has long since outrun its book stock books are becoming even rarer and more expensive thus the status of the individual in the book world is constantly deteriorating if he has the bibliographical knowledge and apparatus to determine what books meet his needs he will probably have difficulty in finding copies of them in the market if he can find them they will probably cost more than he can afford and if he can afford them under modern living conditions he will probably be unable to give them house room now the library is a device by which civilization attempts to resolve most of these difficulties it may be defined as a collection of books that have been selected and organized with respect to their content and the intellectual needs of its public thus it is essentially a microcosm of the book universe of such a nature that the chief characteristics of scholarship and of the literature containing it are reproduced on a scale commensurate with local conditions the library therefore serves i in the cae of a private library this public may consist of a single person
 the library quarterly three major purposes which for convenience may here be distinguished as its scholarly bibliographical and economic functions a library is obviously a reservoir of scholarship in its book stock are stored in potential form innumerable ideas that mankind has garnered by experience and intelligence through the ages because these ideas exist as separate units any of them may be used singly in related groups or in arbitrary selections to induce corresponding kinetic recognitions in a mind that requires them yet the library is more than a mere array of such unitary potentials since the cosmos and the rationality that produce them are interrelated these ideas combine to form a continuous fabric but only the library displays clearly this synthetic character of scholarship for everywhere else it is concealed by the complexities of civilization thus the library is intellectually normative for its community and acts as a corrective to the distortions of the educational curriculum the vagaries of the press and the excesses of vocational specialization here alone science technology and humanity truly come together and coalesce into a synoptic significance accordingly the norms of the library whatever its scale or character are on this dimension the relativity the integrity and the substantiality of the potential scholarship stored up in it now as has been previously remarked books the actual packages of ideas which the library must use are so arbitrary in their content so infinite in their variety and so intractable in their forms that only librarianship amateur or professional can find even crude working solutions for the two great bibliographical problems set by them the first of these is how to discover in the literary chaos what texts will best present each segment of scholarship required by a particular intellectual program the other problem is how to organize these texts after they have been selected so as to make the scholarship they carry accessible as a whole and in all its parts and for every purpose but generally speaking the library resolves both of these difficulties it consists of a book stock and a catalog corresponding to the intellectual needs of its public separately these components would be comparatively weak but together they possess a unique cultural potency and the norms of the library with respect to these artifacts are clearly the efficiency economy and convenience of their operation the economic function of the library is likewise double because books are relatively both rare and expensive on neither point are any quantitative measures available yet the basic facts are unmistakable even to guess how large an edition of a book would have to be printed to supply every one who ought to read it with a copy would be foolhardy but obviously the number would surpass the limits of practicability and in the same way although we cannot compute even roughly the cost of providing every citizen individually with all the books he should use in his lifetime we can be quite certain that the sum would awe even a federal bureaucrat but here again civilization by means of the library has circumvented impossibilities in it literature is communalized so that each book can be used by a multitude of readers and its cost met by infinitesimal contributions from all who are benefited by having it
the cultural function of the library i accessible which as a matter of fact includes every member of the community but because this is an intangible long term and mass benefit the norms of the library in this particular must be statistical they consist of such things as the per capita cost circulation and failures to supply the literature needed any particular library may therefore be appraised by the quality of its scholarship the utility of its service and the magnitude of its operations provided of course that in each case the index is read in terms appropriate to the community but such an empirical appraisal will obscure rather than reveal the cultural value of the institution all the functions performed by the library are of a synthetic character they are effected by a steady stream of services each of which is but a microscopic eddy in the tidal flow of human life therefore to realize the true significance of the library one should not merely observe the effects of its presence but contemplate in his imagination the results that would follow from its absence obviously if by some catastrophe all public and private libraries were obliterated as has almost happened in germany every cultural routine would slacken and many of them would cease the library contributes not merely to the wellbeing of civilization but to its existence
