 journal of education for library and information science community leaders who persevered and sought to improve the service learning approach laid the groundwork for the renewal of interest in recent years commitment to service learning has been growing in universities across the nation since the early s one indicator of this burgeoning movement is the establishment and expansion of campus compact a national organization which promotes the involvement of college and university students in community service founded by the presidents of three private universities and the president of the education commission of the states in  campus compact now counts over seven hundred institutions as members the membership includes twoand four year institutions both public and private in forty six states and the district of columbia the organization has a national office in providence rhode island and satellite offices in twenty two states campus compact reports that at more than  percent of member institutions students can take service learning courses which link community service with academic content a seminal document is the wingspread declaration on the civic responsibilities of research universities university faculty and administrators met with representatives of civic and professional organizations and private foundations at the wingspread conference center in racine wisconsin in december  and again in july  to identify approaches for reuniting the research university with a civic mission the conferences coordinated by the university of michigan center for community service and learning were sponsored by numerous organizations including the association of american universities the american association for higher education campus compact and the johnson foundation the resulting document included the conclusion that a core element in the mission of the research university is to prepare students for engaged citizenship through multiple opportunities to do the work of citizenship such work involves real projects of impact and relevance through which students learn the skills develop the habits and identities and acquire the knowledge to contribute to the general welfare the report also calls for students to help build and sustain genuinely public cultures full of conversation argument and discussion about the meaning of their learning their work and their institutions as a whole other evidence of the growing interest in service learning exists as well the final report of the kellogg commission on the future of state and land grant universities was issued in march   the report calls for a renewed covenant in which universities would continue the tradition established by the land grant movement and apply their intellectual resources toward solutions to today pressing social problems one method for using university resources to improve community life according to the commission is curricula which prepare students to be active participants in public life the kellogg commission has called for reshaping ideas about what publiclyfunded universities have called teaching research and service into a commitment to learning discovery and engagement the term learning moves the emphasis from a teacher centered one way time limited activity to a process in which reciprocity between teacher and student is paramount students accept responsibility for their own learning and intellectual growth is expected to last a lifetime discovery is a broad concept which includes varied forms of creative and scholarly activity in

 journal of education for library and information science the potential for increasing student learning is grounded in the benefits of experiential education learning by doing has the potential for resulting in more lasting change for students this potential is rooted in two consequences of experiential education motivation and involvement a community project in which course content is applied can provide the motivation of making clear the connection between class materials and real world situations such a project requires fuller involvement on the part of students many teaching situations including those which are lecture based provide the possibility of passivity for students when students are required to actively apply the knowledge gained in class and to reflect on that activity their increased participation will result in more meaningful learning for many students much of the application of service learning in higher education to date has been to undergraduate curricula however the precepts of adult learning suggest that service learning approaches may be especially suited to increasing student achievement in graduate education particularly in programs with large numbers of students who are over traditional age adult learners are especially eager to understand the relevance of class material to real life and to be convinced that the material they study has practical application when these students can see the successful use of curricular knowledge in a community setting their motivation and retention of material will be substantially increased service learning can counteract the negative effects of specialization in the academy it has become almost an axiom to identify university professors as people who know more and more about less and less service learning projects are interdisciplinary by nature the knowledge needed to help students learn while serving a community is typically grounded in various disciplines for example a project to teach internet searching skills to seniors via a public library would ideally be informed by experts in library science education computing and gerontology even when the knowledge being shared and gained is rooted in one discipline the process of making this knowledge useful to a community outside the university requires communication and interaction with a broad range of people whose backgrounds and outlooks are sure to vary from those of the faculty and students service learning projects can be a vehicle for reducing the isolation of individual professors and for facilitating meaningful collaboration across disciplinary lines thus helping to create more diverse and nurturing communities within a campus by emphasizing service learning faculty can help to balance the impulses which would apply marketplace concepts to all areas of higher education the kellogg commission is among those who have expressed concern about the privatization of public institutions of higher education publicly supported universities in particular have an obligation to include among their goals the maximization of student access to underserved segments of the citizenry and the encouragement of learning and discovery which promote the common good these endeavors can be jeopardized by an overemphasis on cost effectiveness and marketsponsored research in service learning projects academic objectives are pursued through the implementation of projects which serve the community this approach reminds students professors and administrators that the improvement of community life is a university responsibility and that learning can coexist with community engagement
service learning and us education  examples of service learning in us articles by becker cuban and hayes and mccook offer specific descriptions of service learning efforts within lis coursework these examples may stimulate the thinking of other faculty about possible applications of service learning within their own teaching as jacoby has stated service learning is not destined to be used in every course but it is possible to incorporate it in any discipline appropriate courses and workable projects will vary from school to school since community needs differ it seems reasonable to expect that service learning can find a home in every lis program fieldwork as service learning fieldwork options offer opportunities for integrating service learning concepts into the curriculum fieldwork and practicum courses which are already in place in many programs can qualify as service learning experiences provided that the fieldwork helps meet a community need as defined by the community and provided that a component of reflection is included reflection may be practiced by the keeping of a daily log on which the student would receive faculty feedback through in person or online discussion with community partners classmates and professors andor through the writing of a culminating paper the university of south florida usf school of library and information science offers an example of a fieldwork program that is framed as a service learning opportunity two recent projects help demonstrate the emphasis on community engagement interdisciplinarity and reflective practice the identification of appropriate fieldwork projects requires that the faculty member be aware of community engagement opportunities have meaningful contacts in a variety of communities and with community agencies and be able to advise in interdisciplinary subject areas in the cases below these include gerontology social services literacy and rehabilitative counseling friends of the talking book library clearwater florida there are few friends groups for the talking book libraries administered by the national library service for the blind and physically handicapped library of congress the pinellas county talking book library in clearwater florida agreed to be a fieldwork site for usf student paula robinson her project was to develop a friends group for the library her work included mission development organization visits and correspondence with traditional friends groups publicity and outreach in her ongoing logs of work with the fieldwork coordinator ms robinson reflected i am most fascinated by the fact that many of the people that want to do more for the library patrons are people that suffer from the same problems  macular degeneration or a physical handicap  but to a lesser degree for example a woman that has lost sight in only one eye wants to know how she can help patrons that are completely blind it is a group of people that support one another through their knowledge of the restrictions

service learning and lis education  materials and websites that would be helpful to both the library staff and children needing reference help i also explored and recommended websites for the homework help component of the family literacy grant as part of my fieldwork i attended the florida state literacy workshop held in november of  spending two days in intensive workshops on grant management evaluation and outcomes assessment of family literacy programs there i met many other librarians who were working with their communities and heard about the successes and difficulties involved with these programs this was especially interesting to me because as part of another assignment i had just completed a paper on outcomes assessment and adult literacy programs studying current research from around the nation on this topic reflection as a component in fieldwork the act of reflection and developing a set of responses that view the fieldwork experience in the context of relevant social issues is a central component of servicelearning the community agencies provide the venue for the student to learn about other organizational structures and missions by developing library based projects that provide real service to real communities curricular boundaries become transparent thoughtful assessment of the experience provides the means for students to enter the profession with an understanding of the meaning of community engagement as a life long approach to practice this reflection can be made manifest in many forms it is essential that evidence of reflection be part of the curricular requirements it is a fact of life that anything which is not curricular will probably not happen therefore designing requirements which nurture thoughtful assessment must be a part of course design several varied possibilities exist for such requirements a journal can have the effect of stimulating thoughtful consideration on the part of the student the knowledge that they will be required to show evidence of reflection helps to focus students daily thinking and awareness while the intellectual process required to render their thought in writing helps to further develop their understanding another advantage to written reflection is that it provides the instructor with a chance to process then comment upon the students input giving the student material for further reflection in person discussion is another vehicle for encouraging and developing student reflection periodic meetings with the on site supervisor or the faculty contact can provide a forum for discussion and for real time exchange of impressions and conclusions such meetings might be scheduled at regular intervals during the semester gatherings of students involved in fieldwork experiences can provide another valuable approach such forums can result in comparative reflections and peer interaction which provide a useful counterpoint to the students interactions with faculty and fieldwork supervisors it would be interesting and useful for students and faculty alike to invite alumni to return and reflect on previous fieldwork experiences and report on the effects these experiences had on their career development at san josé state university lis practicum students participate in a practicum reflector a listserv on which a faculty member posts weekly questions which require students to reflect on their internship experiences
 journal of education for library and information science avenues for further action lis faculty who find an affinity to the service learning movement can make substantial contributions professors who are already engaged in teaching approaches which qualify as service learning projects should identify and publicize their efforts and should forge alliances with others who are committed to service learning in their departments their home campuses or other campuses teachers can consider how engaged community activity might be incorporated to strengthen their students mastery of course content and how the incorporation of engaged reflection can deepen the meaning of student activity outside the classroom professors who wish to explore these options are referred to the campus compact website and the kellogg commission report for discussions of theory and to the works of jacoby and crews for an entré into practice lis educators should contribute their experiences with service learning to the national discussion through writing and conference presentation our field can make a substantial contribution to research on the efficacy of service learning approaches in graduate professional education the service learning movement seems to be a natural for library and information science education the approach offers a methodology for improving students learning of course content a chance to bring lis unique sensibilities to bear on the solution of community problems a vehicle for wider communication with other departments on campuses and an opportunity to make solid contributions to a growing national movement the belief that a university should be a valuable citizen is a good fit for librarianship traditional commitment to public service we should insure that our voices and our values are included in the service learning movement acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the work of rachel meyer and elizabeth d engel graduate assistants in the university of south florida school of library and information science who provided valuable research assistance references and notes  harry boyte and elizabeth hollander wingspread declaration on the civic responsibilities of research universities june  prelude available at httpwwwcompactorgcivic wingspreadwingspreadhtml accessed november    barbara jacoby service learning in today higher education in service learning in higher education concepts and practices san francisco jossey bass    ibid robert sigmon linking service with learning washington dc council of independent colleges   and jane kendall combining service and learning an introduction in combining service and learning a resource book for community and public service vol  raleigh nc national society for experiential education    jacoby service learning in today higher education   ibid   kendall combining service and learning   jane kendall from youth service to service learning in ac lewis facts and faith a status report on youth service washington dc youth and america future william t grant foundation commission on work family and citizenship
