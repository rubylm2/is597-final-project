introduction recently the level and structure of state aid to local public libraries in pennsylvania have changed in  the commonwealth of pennsylvania embarked on an aid enhancement program for local public libraries this program increased state aid from approximately  million in  to  million in  after little growth in the years prior to  the purpose of the aid enhancement program was not only to provide greater external funding to boost library services but also to stimulate local government financing local revenue effort provisions were made more favorable for receiving certain types of state aid while most categories of library aid continued to require that specific qualitative standards be met enhancement aid placed increased emphasis on inducing greater local fiscal support the current research investigates a significant policy issue for local public libraries this concerns the impact that state library aid has on local public library expenditures and revenues one of the main empirical questions is whether state aid stimulates local government financing aid stimulation occurs if local library spending increases by more than the amount of aid received thus in order for aid to be stimulative it must increase not only expenditures but also local ownsource revenue if spending increases by less than the amount of aid then aid presumably replaces ownsource local revenue and provides local fiscal relief this apparently was the case for pennsylvania libraries during the first two years of aid enhancement their reliance on state library aid increased and ownsource revenue decreased in the enhancement period state aid as a percentage of local revenue increased from  percent in  to  percent in  a few previous studies have investigated the effect of federal aid programs on state and local library spending however little research has been done on the effect of state aid on local library spending the experience of pennsylvania local libraries over the last several years offered an excellent opportunity to estimate the extent of grant stimulation and fiscal relief for local libraries the current research estimated the extent of expenditure response to aid further it tested whether expenditure response was different during the first two years of aid enhancement  the quantitative effect of state library aid on local library expenditures is an empirical question in this article the determinants of local library expenditures and state aid were estimated simultaneously because they were assumed interdependent in this twostage process local library officials make expenditure decisions by interacting with elected officials and voters through the democratic political process it follows that factors influencing the demand of local citizens are important in determining the librarys spending decisions the empirical analysis undertaken in this article involved pooling annual observations for public libraries in all sixtyseven pennsylvania counties it covered the six years between  and  it differed in several respects from previous empirical studies of library and other expenditures first the stimulative effect of aid was investigated in separate simultaneous equations the twostage least squares procedure was used to estimate the determination of local library expenditures and state aid second library expenditures and state aid were estimated for local governments within a given state the advantage was that it reduced the effect of institutional differences that existed across state governments third estimation across time provided results for predicting each county governments response to changes in the various determinants over time it enabled estimation of the effect of growth variables such as state aid on expenditures further it allowed for comparison of the level of state aid in highgrowth and lowgrowth periods the next section reviews the results on the impact of grants from various empirical studies a description of the categories and growth of state aid then follows this also includes statistics on local library revenues and expenditures special features of the data are then considered a detailed exposition of the empirical model follows this provides the basis for empirical estimation the results of empirical estimation then are tested and discussed finally results are summarized conclusions are offered and limitations are noted   frank gourdy  found that approximately  percent of general revenuesharing grants resulted in new spending and that approximately  percent substituted for state and local revenue   in addition to goudys research  bruce kingma joseph shubert and amanda yeoh  investigated how a change in the federal library aid program affected state library spending and income previous empirical studies the conceptual analysis of grants fostered a large body of empirical work concerning their role in state and local finance in recent years two major issues have dominated empirical research on the effects of intergovernmental aid both issues were concerned mainly with the fiscal response of state and local governments to the receipt of aid the first issue concerned estimating the stimulativereplacement effect of aid while the second issue concerned estimating the extent of the flypaper effect many empirical studies have investigated the stimulative effect of aid however few have provided evidence of the fiscal response to library aid gold and lowenstein  provided a table listing the estimated fiscal impacts of federal aid taken from more than twentyfive empirical studies in most of these studies expenditures were regressed on aid and other explanatory variables expenditures were usually measured by the total dollar amount spent by state or local governments a few studies estimated the grants impact on specific expenditures like highways  welfare  and education  all the studies in the gold and lowenstein  survey showed that the expenditure response to aid was positive however none of the later studies  showed that grants were stimulative whereas most of the earlier studies  showed they were the estimated expenditure response to each dollar of aid was between  and  in the later studies while it was between  and  in the earlier studies one reason for the reduced expenditure response was that several categories of federal aid changed their focus from aid stimulation to fiscal relief in any event the results from the later studies were thought to be more convincing because they offered improved econometric specification of the estimating equations evidence from other studies also showed that different categories of grants elicited different expenditure responses generally a pure matching grant requires a matching local revenue contribution from local governments while a nonmatching grant does not consequently a larger local expenditure response would be expected from a matching grant the empirical results seem to confirm these expectations the flypaper effect deals with a local governments expenditure response to the receipt of a nonmatching grant the receipt of a nonmatching grant can be viewed like additional private income because it has no conditions attached to its use consequently it should have the same effect on expenditures as the receipt of additional private income however evidence showed expenditure response to nonmatching aid was greater than what was found for private income variables one reason for this is the flypaper effect which asserts that local public officials view the receipt of aid as found money rather than as additional community income in other words grant money tends to stick where it hits public officials are more likely to use grant receipts to finance local services than to distribute it to the community in the form of tax relief the flypaper effect has been widely investigated by many empirical studies evidence of the flypaper effect has been found by numerous researchers  while little evidence exists on the effects of aid on library expenditures several studies have investigated the connection between library expenditures and use library use is usually considered an output measure of library services while expenditures reflect the dollar value of various inputs used to produce those services library use refers to the production activities of libraries including transactions hours of operation and availability of material resources  p  expenditures per capita also indicate the capability of the library to provide services therefore the analysis of input and output decisions focuses on the effectiveness of the library as the main decisionmaking unit martha kyrillidou  p  found that various input measures did not relate well to output measures such as reference transactions circulation interlibrary loans and bibliographic instruction although little of her own evidence was offered this conclusion was based on previous empirical studies and statistics from the association of research library statistics daniel oconnor and robert fortenbaugh  found some interesting results from their study of new jersey public libraries they used simple linear regression to estimate the determinants of library funding and library usage it was assumed that library funding and library use were determined separately consequently ordinary least squares regression was used to estimate separate equations for library funding library income per capita and library use circulation per capita library funding had a positive relationship with education percent of community with some college and library use had a positive relationship with library income per capita percentage of variation explained

the few that empirically investigated the determinants of library inputs and library outputs separately however their estimation results explained the effect of few other explanatory variables on library funding or use and the simultaneity problem was not considered several previous empirical studies have attempted to explain library use mostly from the perspective of consumers of library services early studies of library users identified variables that reflected differences in age gender education income occupation race marital status and unemployment and population density many studies have also investigated the determinants of academic library use by students  a recent article by william mcgrath  gave a good review of empirical studies between  and  that have investigated the determinants of circulation and use another area of empirical investigation concerns quality of service service quality ultimately depends upon consumer satisfaction and wellbeing therefore outcomes should reflect better informed and more highly satisfied users unfortunately it is difficult to find quantitative measures of public outcomes john bertot and charles mcclure  offered a good review of library studies that have attempted to define outcomes and developed appropriate methodology for conducting outcomes assessment   ronald fisher  pp  gives a good review of the evidence for different categories of aid   james hines and richard thaler  provide a good review of the empirical issues   studies investigating library effectiveness contrast with those investigating efficiency  these efficiency studies were concerned with identifying the smallest set of inputs for producing a given output data envelopment analysis dea is a linear programming technique that has been used to measure efficiency dea is especially useful for organizations like libraries that produce multiproduct or multiservice outputs from multiple inputs   carol kronus  p  gave a summary of variables that were employed in fortyfive studies of adult library use douglas zweizig  and george delia  also offered models that investigated the effect of various independent variables on use   delia and walsh  provided an excellent conceptual discussion of user satisfaction in october  a symposium of articles was presented on library service quality at the association of research library meetings see kyrillidou and fred heath  for the introductory overview of this symposium descriptive statistics on state library aid and local library finance pennsylvania public libraries receive seven different categories of state aid table  summarizes each grant categorys main features allocation criteria and payment method incentive for excellence aid is the only aid category with matching provisions tied to local effort however it is not an openended matching grant because the matching funds stop once expenditures per capita are above  the receipt of equal distribution grants and equalization aid also

library expenditures and lr  local government revenue quality libraries aid and incentive for excellence aid are the two main sources of state library aid they accounted for a major portion of the increase in enhancement aid both categories of aid showed substantial increases in  and  they were the only categories to show an increase in  the first year of the aid enhancement program the increases resulted from increased payment per capita under quality libraries aid and a higher matching rate for per capita expenditures under incentive for excellence aid in  a total of  million was paid for each of these two aid categories in  quality libraries aid increased to  million and incentive for excellence aid increased to  million the combined percentage of total state aid received from these two categories increased from  percent to  percent between  and  county coordination aid and district library center aid were two other aid categories that increased in  county coordination aid increased from  million in  to  million in  receipt of county coordination aid requires that libraries implement a countywide cooperative plan to improve and extend services the amount of county coordination aid paid is based on a percentage match for libraries that receive a direct county appropriation pennsylvania classifies its sixtyseven counties from first class to eighth class each county class has a stipulated range of population where larger counties have a lower classification number matching rates vary from  percent for eighthclass counties to  percent and lower for second through seventhclass counties these rates are given in table  district library center aid is paid to twentyeight libraries designated by the state librarian to make their resources and services available to those in assigned districts and to render certain other services to local libraries in the district it increased from  million in  to  million in  pennsylvania counties also received state library aid from three other aid categories which did not change in the first two years of the aid enhancement program these were regional resource center aid equal distribution aid and equalization aid four libraries throughout the state designated to serve as regional resource centers received regional aid however it increased from  million in  to  million in  equal distribution aid paid each library a fixed amount  in  to supplement its materials budget equalization aid was paid to selected libraries that met criteria for being in an economically distressed municipality and maintained or exceeded financial effort of the previous year in addition to intergovernmental aid data table  gives annual financial statistics for local revenue and expenditures library operating expenditures increased from  million in  to  million in  library operating expenditures included payments for salary and wages employee benefits books and material acquisitions and other current expenditures the highest rates of growth in operating expenditures and local government revenue occurred between  and  expenditures e increased  million about  percent and local government revenue lr increased  million about  percent however total state aid g increased  million about  percent moreover other local income declined by almost a million dollars between  and  it was also a smaller percentage of total local revenue in  than it was in  it declined from  percent to  percent these fiscal patterns suggest that state aid partially replaced local government revenue sizable increases of state aid were associated with increases in library operating expenditures but the increases were less than the increases in aid thus some of the increased aid apparently was used to reduce what would have been needed from local government support aid replacement is indicated when local revenue is a smaller percentage and aid is a larger percentage of operating expenditures state aid increased as a percentage of operating expenditures from about  percent in all years between  and  to  percent in  and  percent in  at the same time local revenue as a percentage of expenditures fell from  percent in  to  percent in  another way to analyze expenditure change is to look at the expenditures on library personnel expenditures on wage and salaries accounted for the major portion of operating expenditures table  shows that this was more than  percent of operating expenditures in all years between  and  in all years the growth rate for wages and salaries ranged between  percent and  percent except between  and  when it increased  percent further it grew by  percent between  and  libraries also spent significant amounts on books and materials expenditures on books and materials increased  percent between  and  expenditures on books and materials were  percent of operating expenditures in  while they were  percent of operating expenditures in  and  other operating expenditures also contributed to a significant increase in current operating expenditures these expenditures were for children young adult and adult services library administration information services interlibrary loan service technical services audiovisual materials and public relations other expenditures increased  percent between  and  however they were  percent of current operating expenditures in  and  percent in    most of the information in table  was obtained from categories of state aid  an internal document prepared by the state library of pennsylvania pennsylvania department of education bureau of library development also see pennsylvania library laws  for more complete and detailed information on the aid categories   basic standards are summarized in categories of state aid  and detailed in pennsylvania library laws  specific standards are given in considerable detail for library systems local libraries and branch libraries   the trend of increasing state aid continued in  total state aid appropriated in  and  was an identical  million further the appropriations decreased to  million in  and  million in    other local income includes dividend and interest income gifts donations and fund drive revenue merchandise sold fines other charges library use and rental income and other miscellaneous revenue in addition libraries also received a small amount of federal aid total federal aid receipts were between  million and  million between  and  description of sample and data sources public libraries included in this studys sample are considered state aided in order to be state aided libraries must have met state standards and received state aid nonstateaided libraries did not receive state aid either because they did not meet the standards or because they chose not to apply each sample unit consisted of those stateaided public libraries located in a given countys service area a stateaided public library within a given county can be a local library a county library or a county library system these different types of stateaided libraries are described as follows    a local library is established and maintained by a municipality or by a private association to meet the needs of all the residents of the area for which its governing body is responsible   a county library derives income based on allocations from county commissioners it is intended to bring library service to those county residents not served by other local libraries located within the same county   a library system is a countylevel federation of at least two local libraries that serves at least  people libraries voluntarily agree to participate in the federation and to delegate the policymaking function to a system board of directors variables used in this study were aggregated and reported as one county total the county totals may not capture the structural differences in operation and financing across local libraries within each county many counties had different combinations of library types in  local libraries in thirtyfive of pennsylvanias sixtyseven counties pooled their operations to qualify as a library system for state aid on behalf of their combined service areas in many counties library systems accounted for all aid receipts however several large counties had a combination of local libraries county libraries and library systems within their service areas two counties montgomery and schuylkill had two library systems philadelphia reported aid receipts for one library unit philadelphia free library many of the thirtytwo counties that did not have a library system operated a county library several of the smaller counties had only a single county library that reported aid receipts the statistics on library finances were derived from two separate annual reports of the pennsylvania office of commonwealth libraries bureau of library development these were summary of state aid to public libraries  and pennsylvania library statistics  both publications provided aggregate statistics for each of pennsylvanias sixtyseven counties summary of state aid is an annual report of the various categories of aid paid to public libraries and library systems in pennsylvania aid payments were based on what the state government appropriated to libraries in its fiscal year that ran from july  to june  library statistics is also an annual publication that reported statistics on income expenditures resources and usage for local libraries and library systems in pennsylvania library statistics was dated based on fiscal years similar to those used for the summary of state aid however the fiscal year of library statistics often did not correspond with the fiscal year of summary of state aid it is estimated that approximately  percent of pennsylvania public libraries reported income and expenditures based on the previous calendar year rather than on the current fiscal year for instance the  statistics mostly reported income and expenditures for the  calendar year while the  summary of state aid reported aid receipts for the  fiscal year in any given year income and expenditure variables shown in the statistics publication were matched against state aid variables from the preceding years summary of state aid publication this procedure was essential in order to estimate the influence of current year aid on current year expenditures state aid is treated as a single total amount rather than using the individual amounts for each aid category the main reason was the higher annual variation found in total aid than in individual categories of aid many counties received the same amounts of aid categories over several years however few received the same total amount for all categories of aid in consecutive years further many counties did not receive any aid for certain categories finally this study is mainly concerned with the stimulationreplacement response of expenditures to changes in total aid population statistics used to distribute different categories of state aid were from data published in the us census population reports state publications  show that population for the library service areas was based on the  census during the first four years  and on the  census during the last two years  however these population statistics did not capture the annual growth in population therefore all per capita variables used the annual population estimates from the us census bureaus  web site these estimates were based on the number of people living within an entire county area in only a few cases were substantial differences found between the county service area population reported in state publications and the annual census population estimates the other variables in model estimation were obtained from various sources these sources included categories of state aid  pennsylvania library laws  pennsylvania statistical abstract  pennsylvania local government financial statistics  selected expenditure data for pennsylvania public schools  and survey of current business  the specific variables that were obtained from these sources are given in appendix a   i would like to thank matt kane of the office of commonwealth libraries bureau of library development for clarifying this point   the bureau of economic analysis population estimates were highly correlated with service area population they had a simple correlation coefficient of  empirical model an overview of the model and specification of estimating equations the specification of the empirical model is based on the principles from the theory of grants literature in this literature grants are broadly classified as matching and nonmatching matching grants require some local revenue match while nonmatching grants are lumpsum payments that do not require a local revenue match matching grants effectively lower the relative price to localities because each dollar spent is accompanied by matching funds from the state government no such price effect is assumed for nonmatching grants the empirical model predicts that both price and purchasing power effects are associated with the receipt of matching state aid if the matching rate increases this implies a lower price for library services the lower price tends to increase the quantity demanded of library services at the same time the purchasing power effect provides the locality with more real income and increases the demand for library services expenditures may increase by more or less than the full amount of the grant depending upon the combined size of the price and purchasing power effects empirical estimation is based on the presumed interdependence between state aid and local public library expenditures certain categories of library aid depend on expenditures because they require local revenue effort in order to receive them at the same time expenditures are a function of state aid because aid finances operating expenditures consequently separate simultaneously determined equations are required for estimating the determinants of expenditures e and state aid g ordinary least squares estimation is not appropriate if the e and g are simultaneously determined because it does not take into account the information provided by the other equation in the system  p  in this article an alternative estimation procedure called twostage least squares is employed to estimate the two simultaneous equations the functional form of the two equations is assumed multiplicative the multiplicative function is nonlinear where an exponential relation is assumed between the dependent variable and independent variables this suggests a constant elasticity across time and counties linear regression can be used to estimate multiplicative functions by transforming their variables into a linear form this is achieved by taking the natural log of variables in each equation the estimated coefficients give the elasticity of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variables thus they give the percentage change in the dependent variable for a  percent change in the explanatory variable the definitions for the discrete and dummy variables in the two equations are given in table  summary statistics also are given for discrete variables all variables expressed in current dollars were adjusted for inflation by using the consumer price index to convert them to constant dollars table  definitions and summary statistics name mean standard deviation definition

equations included in this procedure are as follows   in the simplest case the receipt of a matching grant reduces the effective price of a dollar spent on local library expenditures if m is the percentage matching rate paid for each dollar of expenditures on library services e then the effective price is reduced from e to documentclassaastex usepackageamsbsy usepackageamsfonts

theory the actual quantity change from a price change is broken down into these two separate effects they often are referred to as the substitution price effect and the income purchasing power effect the price effect refers to the substitution of the cheaper aided activity for other activities whose prices do not change the purchasing power effect refers to the increased ability to consume because at the lower price the local government spends less on the same quantity of the aided activity thus local governments had additional real income to spend on all goods some of this income could also have been spent on the aided service   however the price effect of a matching grant may also be limited if it is closedended a closedended grant allows a matching grant only up to a certain limit if the recipient government spends more than the limit before receiving the grant then its effect is similar to a nonmatching grant see fisher  pp  for a good discussion of this point   if the natural logarithmic value of the dependent variable is regressed on the independent variable measured in its original units the estimated coefficient gives the percentage change in the dependent variable for a oneunit absolute change in the independent variable several explanatory variables were expressed in their original units rather than in natural logarithms if the independent variable is not continuous as in the case of dummy variables then the relative change in the dependent variable can be computed by taking the antilog to base e of the estimated dummy variable coefficient and then subtracting one from it see damadar gujarati  p  for a discussion of these points   a predetermined explanatory variable is either an exogenous variable or a lagged dependent variable an exogenous variable is one whose value is determined outside the system of equations being estimated expected effects of explanatory variables principles from economic theory and libraryinformation science are used to specify the explanatory variables included in the two equations these principles predict that the dependent variables respond in a certain way to these explanatory variables it is assumed that the level of expenditures and state aid is determined by the choices of local elected officials and local public library administrators their decisions are based on the attempt to maximize net benefits of library users while maximizing their individual benefits the expenditure levels chosen in this process are based on maximizing the probability of staying in office for elected officials and of obtaining the largest possible budget allocation for library officials this analysis also assumes elected officials are responsive to the tastes of representative voters the median voter is assumed to make the decisive choice under majority rule the preferred expenditure level of the median voter is the one in which half of the voters want more and half of the voters want less under certain assumptions the choice by the median voter leads to a unique political equilibrium public officials responding to local voters therefore largely determine the level of library services provided by a given locality variations in the level of library services across communities thus depend upon the resources and socioeconomic variables affecting the tastes and choices of libraryservices consumers state library aid provides additional resources and more favorable service prices to local public libraries these changes determine the expected response of library expenditures variables affecting state aid response reflect differences in local operating expenditures income and other criteria related to the allocation of various categories of aid the first part of this discussion analyzes the possible impact of state aid on operating expenditures in equation a the impact depends on the size of the respective price and purchasing power effects of a grant both of these effects are expected to increase expenditures as long as the matching rate increases and the aided activity is a normal good in the current study library operating expenditures depend upon total state library aid in each county it includes instruments with both matching and nonmatching provisions the estimated coefficient of the state aid variable reflects the combined elasticity from both price and purchasing power effects the empirical model does not attempt to estimate these effects separately although they are useful for conceptual analysis the estimated elasticity coefficient

this approach uses the previous years expenditures as its base rather than starting from zero estimation results estimation procedure a simultaneous system of equations was estimated for pennsylvania public libraries from the annual pooled data of sixtyseven counties between  and  each equation was based on a sample size of  observations multiple regression analysis was used to test whether variation in library expenditures and state aid depended upon the explanatory variables in the empirical model in each regression equation estimates of the relation between the dependent variable and the independent variables were tested to determine whether sample evidence supported or did not support certain hypothesized effects predicted by the expenditureaid model equations a and b were used to estimate the responsiveness of per capita library operating expenditures and per capita state aid in a simultaneous equation framework these simultaneously determined endogenous variables were assumed to be jointly determined the usual assumption of ordinary least squares estimation is that all the explanatory variables are uncorrelated with the error term in that case each equation can be estimated as if it is independent of the other one this does not hold if the endogenous variables are simultaneously determined the twostage least squares estimation procedure was used to estimate equations a and b this procedure used the information available from the specification of the equation system to obtain a unique estimate of each parameter in the model simultaneously determined endogenous variables must satisfy necessary and sufficient conditions for identification before they can be estimated   expenditures per capita e and state aid per capita g are endogenous variables because they are jointly determined within the system of eqq a and b exogenous variables are determined outside the system of equations for a good discussion of simultaneous equation estimation see robert pindyck and daniel rubinfeld  pp    for a simultaneously determined equation to be identified it must satisfy rank and order conditions both eq a and eq b satisfied these conditions the order condition was satisfied because the number of predetermined variables excluded from eq a and eq b were greater than the number of endogenous variables minus one a procedure suggested by g s maddala  pp  was used to verify that eqq a and b satisfied the rank condition for identification analysis of the effects of state aid on expenditures table  gives the estimates from the twostage least squares procedure both the firststage and the secondstage results are provided firststage results show the estimated responses to all predetermined variables irrespective of whether they were included in the secondstage estimating equations the firststage equations do not include either of the endogenous variables on the righthand side this stage was used to obtain the fitted values of the two endogenous variables secondstage results showed the response of each endogenous variable to the fitted value of the other endogenous variable and the predetermined variables included in the economic model the

services within a given state while the provision of library services is primarily a local function financing is a joint effort of state and local governments in  pennsylvania embarked on an aid enhancement program that offered local libraries higher levels of aid and greater incentives to spend on library operations one of the main purposes of this study was to estimate how local operating expenditures responded to changes in the level and structure of state aid the empirical evidence showed that after controlling for other relevant variables local expenditures were more responsive to aid in the enhancement period than they were before the results showed that a  percent increase in aid increased expenditures  percent prior to enhancement and by  percent during the enhancement period another important finding was that state aid had a stimulative effect on local budgets increases in state aid led to proportionately larger increases in expenditures therefore in any given year the evidence suggested that aid not only increased expenditures but also encouraged localities to spend more than they had received the stimulative effect of grants thus implies that local revenue sources supported some local operating expenditures finally the degree of stimulation appeared to decrease in many counties during the enhancement years although expenditures increased some of the additional aid was also used to reduce local government support therefore enhancement aid provided some fiscal relief the evidence from the first few years of the enhancement aid program suggested that changes in state aid were successful in achieving their intended effects the policy of increasing state aid and providing greater incentives for local government support was an effective means of increasing library expenditures and services without placing a higher burden on local budgets nonetheless the results from the first few years likely gave the estimated shortrun effects continued growth of state aid to pennsylvania public libraries would be expected to elicit a different expenditure response in future years the higher levels of state aid likely will be viewed as permanent if the increases continue in size and scope unfortunately state aid did not show any growth in  and sizable cuts were made in  and  this further complicates the empirical findings because the response of expenditures in a period of decline may not be symmetrical with that estimated in a period of growth  the current article was limited to investigating the effect of state aid on library expenditures the evidence showed that state government had a positive influence on the provision of local government services these results imply desirable outcomes for local library consumers higher levels of expenditures were likely to make more library services available to users one might conclude that library users were better off after the receipt of state aid than they were before in order to test this variables reflecting library use and outcomes were needed no such measures were offered nor were any hypotheses about the expenditureserviceoutcome connection tested this connection is quite complicated potential problems include difficult measurement issues incorrect specification of complicated production and consumption relations and the presence of serious econometric problems future research should be concerned with investigating the relationship between expenditures and use it should also include a careful analysis of outcomes   see eric hanushek  esp pp  for a complete review of these problems as they relate to educational production functions see raymond horton  for a more recent survey of the spendingservice connection from the public managers perspective   sharkansky  and other researchers  have investigated the expenditureservice connection but the evidence has been less than convincing their results varied from showing a significant positive relation to showing no statistical significance one of the main conclusions of these studies is that the significance of this relation may well depend on the type of expenditure being investigated
