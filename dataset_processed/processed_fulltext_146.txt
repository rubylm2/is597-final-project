when we talk about diversity are we both talking about the same thing the dictionary definition of the word diversity is merely the condition of being different merriam webster  in the twenty first century united states however this word is packed with meanings that have arisen out of our history and our need to move forward as we use the word we remember our countrys past history of discrimination against certain types and classes of people and we recognize the need to make sure that we are adequately representing the groups that we excluded in the past this historical context grounds our perceptions of the meaning of diversity in the contemporary workplace the word is used to describe staffing patterns and trends among employees or clientele primarily from the perspective of race ethnicity ability or gender but diversity is a safe wordas many human resources documents tell us diversity is about more than race or gender it includes everyone thus the word diversity gives us an out allowing us to personalize the issue and perhaps letting us continue to ignore the needs of those we have marginalized in the past in section b of its policy manual the american library association  provides the profession of library and information science lis with an extensive definition of who counts as diverse all people especially those who may experience language or literacy related barriers economic distress cultural or social isolation physical or attitudinal barriers racism discrimination on the basis of appearance ethnicity immigrant status religious background sexual orientation gender identity gender expression or barriers to equal education employment and housing nonetheless practicing librarians do not always consult the ala policy manual before applying the word diversity and may have entirely different viewpoints in starting this research project our question was how do librarians think and talk about diversity in the research literature it is not uncommon to find articles asking what lis education is doing about a particular topic from specific areas of librarianship such as academic librarianship to preparing students for change to diversity itself bailey  mullins  jaeger bertot and subramaniam  it is less common to find articles asking what lis associations or workplaces are doing about particular topics practically speaking though lis education occupies only  years of a professionals life lis education is one aspect of their background that most librarians have in common but realistically librarians prior life experiences their workplaces and their involvement in professional associations will occupy much more time than their lis education given this caveat we wanted to look beyond what lis education taught them about diversity and include other potential sources of knowledge about diversity including life experience the workplace and lis associations when looking at questions of diversity we acknowledged that many researchers have been here before us including lori mestre patricia montiel overall renee franklin hill kafi kumasi paul jaeger and mega subramaniam we will present a brief review of our research process and more extensive coverage of our results and the lis literature our research process the question about what diversity means to us was the starting point for us adkins and her two masters students virden and yier to explore larger questions of diversity in librarianship we began with some basic research questions  how do librarians learn about diversity  what roles do lis education lis associations and life experience play in developing librarians diversity knowledge we addressed these questions in several ways first we conducted an extensive review of the lis literature we spoke with professionals in other fields psychology education and law about how they develop diversity awareness in their fields our research team also reflected on our own identities and backgrounds and how those influenced our views of diversity we designed pretested adapted and conducted a short online survey with openand closed ended questions asking lis practitioners about their sources of diversity knowledge the survey went to each of the five ethnic caucuses of ala so we drew from groups that had a vested interest in diversity issues we also surveyed general lis practitioners from groups such as the reference and user services association the new members round table the library research round table and several ala student chapters after the survey we conducted interviews with six lis practitioners around the country for a more in depth look at their diversity knowledge by march  we had  completed surveys from librarians and library workers throughout the united states and other countries the two largest groups of respondents worked in academic libraries  or  and public libraries  or  school library respondents made up  and special library respondents another  the remainder  or  indicated that they worked in other environments such as tribal libraries and museums or were vendors lis students or lis faculty several respondents indicated that they were not employed or not yet employed and some indicated that they worked in multiple library types after collecting survey responses and interviews we read reflected and qualitatively coded our interviews and survey responses our initial coding scheme was developed based on what we found in our literature review and represented practitioners discussions of diversity in the lis literature we jointly coded several survey responses to assess our own understanding of our coding scheme and its applicability to the surveys and interviews as we discussed our common coding experiences however we added and refined our coding scheme to better reflect our teams joint understanding of the concept of diversity and also the codes that emerged from the actual words and concepts we found in our respondents and interviewees comments from our final codes we developed categories that helped us understand some of the theoretical and conceptual issues that might be underlying our profession and its diversity focus we used our interviews to deepen our understanding of some questions but most of the results presented here come from our survey survey responses how do librarians learn about diversity in our survey we asked a closed ended question about how librarians learned about diversity we presented several broad categories for respondents to select as well as an other category with a text box for comments as shown in table  our survey respondents attributed more of their diversity knowledge to life experience and work experience than to lis education or professional development news and popular media also played a major role in providing diversity information to our respondents and many also indicated that they did their own reading and research on library related diversity issues about  in  respondents indicated that their employers provided mandatory or voluntary training opportunities on diversity table â€ƒ survey responses on how respondents learned about diversity method

in the other text box just as we coded our open ended questions in interviews we asked how librarians learned about or encountered diversity in their daily experiences the responses indicated a variety of sources of learning respondents talked about living and working in diverse societies and how they developed awareness of difference through that experience or through specific efforts they had engaged in such as travel study or volunteerism many respondents spoke of their patron base as being a key motivator to learn more about diversity in order to better serve people in their communities our survey including its open ended questions and our interviews suggested that librarians have a variety of ways that they use to learn about diversity lis education and lis associations are important but they are not primary sources for acquiring knowledge of diversity how does lis education contribute to librarians diversity knowledge in her book librarians serving diverse populations challenges and opportunities lori mestre  surveyed academic librarians involved in serving multiple cultures she found that only  of her respondents felt that their lis education had prepared them for working with multiple cultures and another  said that their lis education did not prepare them for such work most respondents said lis education prepared them somewhat she also noted that  of librarians said their lis program offered a course related to multicultural librarianship though  of the library school administrators she surveyed said their program did in fact offer a course relating to multicultural librarianship meanwhile charlene l al qallaf and joseph j mika  found that  of north american lis programs offered a diversity related course subramaniam and jaeger  found that  out of  ischools members of the ischool consortium provided diversity related classes but only  of those courses were required and another  were doctoral level courses mestres findings may explain an experience of the first author of this article adkins she asked some students from a program known for its diversity coverage what they were learning about diversity there was a long pause before someone hesitantly mentioned globalization students may not realize that they are learning about diversity even when lis faculty think they are teaching about diversity as lis faculty we may need to emphasize repeatedly that we are teaching about diversity and the importance of diversity in our profession in our survey we asked respondents whether they had taken courses in their lis program that focused on diversity or included diversity coverage a total of  said they had while  said they had not responses to open ended questions in the survey suggested that students want such a course but do not always see it offered in their programs here are some of the comments we received  a class on diversity should be a requirement for everyone regardless of field or track  i wish my mlis program included more diversity topics and multiculturalism services in libraries  unfortunately there were no diversity courses offered nor did we focus very much on diversity in our courses  its embarrassing how little we discuss diversity in our curriculum at the ischool however other comments suggested that students appreciate taking diversity courses when they can get them respondents identified courses and faculty by name indicating that these courses were memorable and important to them  dr naidoos outreach to diverse populations class at ua slisgreat course  ucla ethics and diversity course  the university of washington included some great classes about indigenous knowledge systems  fsu grad school offers a class information for diverse users that was very informative on this subject  it was the most engaging thought provoking course in my lis program al qallaf and mikas results indicate that library employers want their employees to be able to work with diverse and multicultural populations they state that the identified qualifications and skills from the content analysis suggest that employers for the most part are searching for information professionals with some form of experience in multicultural settings that have the ability to work with faculty students and staff from diverse backgrounds andor who have demonstrated skills related to various cultural attributes  clearly then there is a demand by both employers and potential employees for courses that cover diversity in the frame of user services and users information needs lis educators may think they have met the need judging by the data collected by mestre al qallaf and mika and subramaniam and jaeger however librarians in mestres survey and many in our survey think otherwise the good news is that diversity coverage in lis education seems to be increasing over time in the survey comments there was a definite time based trend in that those whose lis education was more recent were more likely to have had access to information on diversity table  includes some of the comments we found that listed dates of lis program attendance in the s and s respondents were clear in indicating that there was no diversity education our respondents started to indicate that a change was happening by the s and a respondent who had graduated in the s clearly indicated the beginning of some diversity education in addition the commenter above who referred to jamie naidoos class was a student in the s or s who clearly had exposure to diversity table â€ƒ survey comments about diversity in lis education by referenced date time period respondent comment s my library degree was earned in  there were no diversity programs then i went to library school in  i dont think they had diversity as a topic then s i went to library school in the mid s and there was not much discussion of diversity then it should have been a part of lis education but was not in any real sense when i got my degree s s i graduated in fall this was not really emphasized back then it was the early s and some discussion of looking at texts other than by old white guys was just beginning s its been over  years but yes i did take courses related to learning about native american and hispanic library users and reaching out to nontraditional library users in summary the answer to the question how does lis education contribute to librarians diversity knowledge is that until the s it did not and for many respondents it still may not respondents who graduated after the s suggested that it was a very valuable part of their learning how do lis associations contribute to librarians diversity knowledge our lis associations have been very active in their support of diversity primarily through the work of some active members and committees we see evidence of this support in several ways as mentioned earlier section b of the ala policy manual american library association  includes a section specifically addressing diversity of information users when it discusses the critical need for access    by all peoples section b further acknowledges the need for increased diversity among library personnel suggesting that this need should be filled through concrete programs of recruitment training development advancement and promotion as listed in section a of the policy manual diversity and equitable access are two of alas key action areas intended to help the association prioritize its investments and decision making the ala is supporting diversity at a practical level as well as a policy level through the creation of and support for the spectrum scholarship for underrepresented groups pursuing lis masters degrees the association of research libraries which is affiliated with but not subordinate to ala provides the initiative to recruit a diverse workforce another program of recruitment and professional development for lis masters students from traditionally underrepresented groups both programs provide scholarship support professional mentoring and career development training in addition to diversity support in ala various divisions and associations within ala are emphasizing the importance of diversity for example the association of college and research libraries  recently developed a set of cultural competencies for academic librarians the association for library service to children  and the young adult library services association  work extensively with ala ethnic caucuses to promote diversity in materials when our survey respondents talked about lis associations and how those associations helped keep them aware of diversity they mentioned other sources too  ala spectrum institute and joint conference of librarians of color  bcala black caucus of the ala listserv  mid america library alliance live workshops and webcasts  social media    apala asian pacific american librarians association  the recent brouhaha with the ala code of conduct in terms of contributing to librarians knowledge about diversity section b of the ala policy manual describes the need to include diversity in programs activities services professional literature products and continuing education however our respondents tended to focus on the bigger items eg spectrum initiative and ethnic affiliates eg black caucus of the ala and did not tend to cite general ala conference programming continuing education was indicated as a source of diversity knowledge but provided by a regional consortium rather than ala or its divisions this might suggest that diversity awareness needs to be local and more regionally defined in one interview a respondent shared that her biggest diversity challenge was providing appropriate services for refugees from a specific country she said she had trouble finding diversity support resources geared toward that particular need at a national level conference lis associations have kept diversity awareness front and center but this has not meant that the body of lis practitioners has become much more reflective of our community while our nation rapidly diversifies our profession is diversifying far less rapidly from some of the comments given to us by survey respondents we could perceive some diversity fatigue weariness or cynicism in the face of messages about the importance of diversity in contrast to the relative stability of the professions white straight female demographic even so the majority of respondents seemed eager to talk about diversity and their libraries progress toward it how do librarians talk about diversity now we get back to our original question are we talking about the same thing when we talk about diversity we explored this question through the written answers to an open ended survey question how do you define diversity we got  written responses to this question some were off the cuff and humorous and some merely paraphrased boilerplate language but many people took the time to reflect deeply and respond to the question based on our literature review we suspected we knew how diversity would be defined and we created our original coding scheme based on those suppositions as we were reading and coding answers however our list of terms expanded our original list included race ethnicity gender ability sexual preference and sexual identity our respondents went further including geographic political and other identity status indicators we created codes and categories using the words that our respondents used to answer the question on diversity and assigned each code once per response for instance one response was diversity is inclusive but not limited to the consideration of race culture ethnicity gender age religionfaith socioeconomic background physical abilitiesqualities sexual orientation and linguistic ability that response was given eight different codes raceethnicityculture sexuality gendergender identity religionbelieffaith physical and mental ability classsocioeconomic languageaccent and inclusiontogetherness table  shows our codes and the frequency with which we assigned them to responses we divided our codes into two broad categories one addressed descriptions of diversity or what makes a person diverse the other category was oriented more toward the concept of diversity itself and how people think about it table â€ƒ codes classifying respondents answers to the question how do you define diversity descriptions of diversity code counts diversity as a concept code counts raceethnicityculture  mixturevariety

minoritiesunderprivileged  equalityproportionality  personality types  white privilege  veteran status  celebrating diversity  cognitive style  richness  personal identity  education  protected groups  geography  body type  legal definition  definitions of who counts as diverse or what makes a person diverse followed the expected patterns of being heavily influenced by us history and the civil rights movement when our respondents defined what diversity meant to them they most frequently used words such as race ethnicity and culture other concepts that potentially came from national struggles for equality were sexuality gendergender identity age and veteran status our respondents answers also brought up some different ideas about diversity class socioeconomic status religious and political views nationality and personality type the focus on race as a key indicator of diversity is not new mega subramaniam howard rodriguez mori renee franklin hill and paul jaeger studied lis dissertations from  to  and found that racial diversity has traditionally received the most focus in lis literature   the same held true for lis literature jaeger et al  the variety of concepts identified by our survey respondents exceeded the number of concepts we found in the lis literature this may indicate changing mind sets and changing ideas of diversity and who counts as diverse librarians in writing about their own beliefs are able to explore ideas that phd candidates needing to review the existing lis literature cannot broach and that writers of the current lis literature have not yet broached our respondents also provided information about their concepts of diversity and how diversity was to be practiced the codes we most frequently applied to responses were mixturevariety and inclusiontogetherness several respondents spoke of diversity as requiring different groups to interact together and mentioned the need for active efforts to create an inclusive environment codes such as respect acceptance and awareness seemed to indicate differing views on the depth to which diversity should be incorporated a few brave respondents indicated that building their diversity awareness also involved challenging their ideas of comfort and safety going from the known to the unknown language the words we use when we talk about people and their needs has the potential to influence our thoughts and our actions moyra lang notes this when she points out the need to ensure that the needs of transgender people are taken as seriously as the needs of gay lesbian and bisexual people when implementing position statements advocating for equal service to lgbt groups she writes librarians need to understand how the dominant terms and language restrict boundaries of sex gender and sexual orientation to a sticky matrix of conflated terms we can begin to untangle the language and learn new ways to include patrons who are often excluded and provide access to much needed information lang   this statement applies equally to other diverse groups our notions of diversity develop from our history and our culture and as a result we may have preconceived notions about who belongs in a certain category we should note that many in our professionincluding the first author of this articlealso typically look at diversity from a racial perspective at a previous conference when our hosts talked about the university of marylands idiversity program as being open to all students there was concern that this would disenfranchise the students whom some felt represented true diversity that is racial and ethnic diversity however paul jaeger and mega subramaniam pointed out that their program by highlighting inclusion actually attracted more students of color to lis education looking at our profession and our professional responsibilities through the lens of inclusion reminds us that our obligation is to go beyond accepting and appreciating difference it extends to changing ourselves and our practices to help others in their information seeking quests
