a white librarian in black harlem betty l jenkins ernestine rose   was a pioneer in providing library services to blacks in harlem at the th street branch of the new york public library from  to  she galvanized the resources of the community and applied the prestige of the new york public library to plan execute and promote library services at a time when blacks were moving in large numbers to new york after world war i under rose leadership the branch became a model of public library services to an underserved minority the purpose of this study is to chronicle and assess her work during the negro renaissance a dynamic period of the community history a  survey of library services for blacks in eight southern and nothern cities singled out the th street branch of the new york public library for promoting reading as a wholesome cultural and leisure time activity and for providing the community with story hours free public lectures by outstanding men and women exhibits of black artists and sculptors and a reference collection on black literature   p  the person responsible for these services was ernestine rose the branch librarian from  until  rose played an important role in making the branch an intellectual and social center for the community by hiring black professional staff by using community leaders to help plan policy and programs and by ensuring that the branch serve as both teacher to and affirmer of the community it served in the first two decades of the century blacks moved in large numbers to cities from the south and from overseas they came to new york city and settled in harlem making it one of the largest concentrations of black people in the world since rose had worked with european immi morris raphael cohen library city college of the city university of new york new york new york  library quarterly vol  no  pp     by the university of chicago all rights reserved      
white librarian in harlem  grants on the lower east side in the years before world war  she was considered the right person to administer the branch in harlem and to alter its services to meet the needs of the newcomers after more than a decade of working with disadvantaged peoples rose came to harlem predisposed to helping minorities adjust to a new life and gain acceptance working in the black community however rose was faced with the intractable problem of racial segregation and prejudice she persisted nevertheless in working with her staff community leaders and library professional organizations to promote an understanding of black people their contributions to american life and their rights as citizens to exemplary public library services the story of rose inspiration vision and participation in the development of the branch and its activities and her commitment to fighting racial prejudice have been overshadowed in time her legacy to researchers who are now beginning to put her contributions into historical perspective is the rich store of articles speeches reports of meetings pamphlets and a book the public library in american life  which chronicle her public life as branch administrator teacher and trainer of librarians and activist in professional library associations this article is a study of her career as a pioneer in the development of urban library services to blacks early life education and career ernestine rose was born on march   in bridgehampton new york to stephen e and anna chatfield rose her mother descended from an old english family on long island was a teacher and principal and for a time taught at bridgehampton academy where rose went to school  p  the academy founded before the civil war was considered one of the best schools in the area and had a reputation for preparing its students for the professions  p  it was expected that upon graduation students would continue their education at college rose went to wesleyan university and then enrolled in the new york state library school in albany completing the required course of study in   p  before graduating however she worked as a summer substitute for the new york public library  assigned to a branch in an immigrant neighborhood on new york city lower east side rose met librarians who were sympathetic to immigrant life and who appreciated their culture this association probably helped to determine the thrust of her career as a librarian whose interest would always be both in her everyday work in the branches of public libraries and in her volunteer
 the library quarterly work with professional or staff organizations with the underserved or disadvantaged unlike some librarians whose outreach services to these newcomers were designed to americanize them as quickly as possible rose worked with librarians who like the social workers in the community emphasized the importance of the neighborhood and focused on programs which not only helped the immigrant to adjust to a new country with mothers clubs english classes and the like but also encouraged an acceptance and maintenance of the immigrants customs and culture  pp   rose returned to the new york public library as a librarian after working one year at wesleyan university and was once again assigned to the branch libraries which served immigrant populations  after becoming head of seward park branch located in a russian jewish section rose became well known for her work with the foreign born in  she wrote a warm account about her experiences bridging the gulf work with the russian jews and other newcomers  in rose view it was the obligation of the library to help the immigrant bridge the gulf between his culture and the american way by maintaining an appreciation for his own culture while learning the skills necessary for citizenship namely literacy and language she encouraged her library staff to be knowledgeable about the users traditions and customs so that they could serve them with sympathetic understanding she wrote one must be as familiar with jewish holidays as with christian nothing must be alien to you eculiar or even picturesque in the sense of a curiosity  p  she would later adapt these approaches of work with immigrantssuch as a knowledge of the language and literature of the community the foreign language book collection and activities celebrating the immigrants cultural heritage to her work in harlem fifty years later rose recalled those days on the lower east side with fondness and pride she wrote earnest young people sought work in the slum areas as nurses teachers pastors and social workers some of them drifted to libraries feeling that in these also lay an opportunity to reach the submerged masses  p  work with the foreign born was the first phase in rose long career as a librarian and a teacher she devoted herself to groups with special needs not only on the lower east side and in harlem but during world war i as director of hospital libraries for the american library association and with the army of occupation in coblenz germany  jean blackwell hutson who worked with rose at the th street branch recalled that while in germany rose came in contact with large numbers of black soldiers  many of them were illiterate and in need of reme
white librarian in harlem  dial work  p  perhaps rose saw in these young men the desire for learning and recognized that opportunities for education at home had been denied them because of their race on her return to new york city rose was appointed branch librarian at the th street branch near lenox avenue a main thoroughfare in harlem the branch opened in  to serve a genteel middle class jewish community but by the time rose arrived in  the community had changed a white librarian in black harlem the great migration prior to and following world war i brought thousands of southern blacks along with those from the spanish and british west indies and south america to harlem harlem was by now new york black city  p  among the black newcomers there was as much national political and class diversity as one would expect to find in the city as a whole rose described them as black and yellow stately hindoo proud west indian mulatto american    porter college professor nursemaid student  p  moreover she wrote the americans africans and west indians who made up this great city of black people are rich and poor learned and illiterate patriotic and nationalistic  unlike other black communities in the north harlem in the s was unique it had become a meeting place of blacks from all over the world giving them an opportunity to see themselves as members of a world community with a common heritage  p  many sought to define themselves in new ways this meant giving additional emphasis to a rediscovery of their heritage through studying and celebrating their folklore history arts and letters a new negro was born out of the social ferment of the times the black intellectuals of the s with alain locke as one of their spokesmen sought to define their new status and their sense of self in the new negro a collection of essays edited by locke  thus began a decade of intellectual and cultural activity known as the negro renaissance in which the library was to play a significant role soon after she arrived at the th street branch rose noted with some concern the increasing self segregation of harlem institutions its churches theaters newspapers and social service organizations were increasingly black sponsored staffed and managed although harlem was a cosmopolitan city it was an all black one divided rose wrote by many conflicting lines of thought belief and hope  p  furthermore she recognized the paradox of harlem existence in
 the library quarterly contrast to the european immigrant ethnic communities she extolled in bridging the gulf as being due to the legacy of slavery and the persistence of racial prejudice  p  nevertheless she was dismayed by blacks thrust for cultural separatism it is an interesting commentary on race conditions in the north that the trend today is all toward such segregation the new note that is being struck comes from the colored race which is joining now with the white in its cry for race integrity   p  to her credit rose addressed the issue of race integrity head on with her customary optimism by acknowledging that this separatist attitude need not be all negative she continued many accompaniments of this new note are valuable ones including efforts towards greater knowledge and intelligence regarding the past history of the negro and towards a development of the negro own peculiar racial gifts and powers no race can take its proper place in the world until it knows itself and learns to develop itself depending on no one charity  p  thus as rose saw it the th street branch library had a twofold task to bridge the gulf between the races and to make the library an integral part of the community its programs and book collection had to stimulate guide and promote racial pride for blacks themselves and they were necessary to educate whites about the history and culture of black americans racial understanding for rose could be achieved through knowledge the branch was to be a center where diverse paths may meet and clashing interests find union  p  she was equally determined that the library should not follow other institutions in the community and become a segregated library it was not easy to reconcile her belief in the public library as a place that encouraged rational thought and provided the books and ambience for the discussion of issues which divided the races when social and economic forces pulled the races apart nevertheless she resisted the role of the branch as an element in race segregation just as she had resisted a library in a russian jewish community becoming entirely jewish  p  one way to achieve her goal was to integrate the library staff black staff members would serve the same purpose in the harlem community as the foreign assistants did for branches which served european immigrants in explaining her hopes for a spanish speaking staff member and one from the british west indies rose noted the intimacy they provided which aided the library outreach and effectiveness one of the services which the colored assistants render the library is the knowledge of neighborhood affairs and people which they gain far more quickly than the members of an alien race even if they entered the
white librarian in harlem  district as strangers at the same time this intimacy has been of great advantage in making the library better known  p  in addition rose may have harbored some misgivings about the community acceptance of her leadership because she was white the first black librarian within the new york public library system was hired in  because she anticipated that the community would be pleased to see blacks in frontline positions she placed some black staff in visible public service roles nella larsen imes a novelist was a children librarian and pura belpre white a puerto rican was hired to address the needs of the spanish speaking population not only were black assistants likely to be more sympathetic to black users needs but the experiment of an interracial staff was one of the ways the library could demonstrate its allegiance to democratic principles in addition rose believed that when white and black staff worked together for the service of the community both groups learned to appreciate racial and cultural diversity she arranged a staff exchange program between a branch in a predominantly white neighborhood and the th street branch the benefit of this experiment she explained was that preconceived notions about race would disappear if black and white staff worked together   p  library governance with community leaders since she was a white librarian in the race charged atmosphere of the period rose position was potentially precarious but she was serious in her belief that the th street branch was the library for all in the community and she worked to make it so by involving black community leaders who knew it best to plan organize and promote programs throughout the twenty two years she worked in harlem a knowledgeable and committed group of civic leaders librarians and scholars guided rose with ideas and resources rose political and practical awareness of her situation made this symbiotic relationship a hallmark of her leadership and success for example soon after her arrival prominent citizens were called together to plan the first of several library sponsored exhibits of black artists   committees were also formed to set up the division of negro literature history and prints to advise on policy and program for the privately funded harlem adult education project and to plan for the renovation and expansion of the branch during the s regarding her work with members of the community she wrote the negro editors are among the best friends of the library and it is thru them the social
 the library quarterly workers and other prominent individuals that the library is extending its influence slowly but surely thru the various strata of negro life the library must gain the interest and support of this social and professional often wealthy group before it can hope to become an integral part of negro life  p  within six months of rose arrival the library had become the vital popular community center which prompted comparison and praise in woofter study rose encouraged community groups such as the john brown historical society the odd fellows the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp the harlem community forum and the liberty league of negro americans to hold their meetings at the branch art exhibits music recitals book talks forums for discussion of current topics and lecture courses given by educators were all regular fare  p  as a result of the branch open door policy and outreach the programs were successful almost immediately so many people came to the library that rose reported an increase of  percent in circulation for the half year july december  and registration of new readers placed the th street branch among the five largest branches in manhattan  p  the branch held a rather undistinguished book collection although rose found that the general books on history sociology philosophy and the useful arts appealed to many users she noted that people were hungry for knowledge and eager to educate themselves the application desk of a public library serves as a doorway into the ther half of many lives the half which lives while not working for a living the half which thinks aspires and endures  p  this expression of empathy demonstrates an important ingredient of her work with and for black populations rose accomplishments after so short a time were praised by her superior franklin hopper who said in the annual report for the year that the interracial staff experiment and the change of spirit of the administration of the branch had a marked effect on the influence of the branch throughout the community  p  division of negro literature history and prints in  rose recognized that the increasing race consciousness of the times was reflected in an intense interest in books by and about black people so she set about replenishing the book collection   p  some titles were irreplaceable because they were out of print others were available only in private collections and there was little money to replace
white librarian in harlem  those that could be purchased rose borrowed some books from scholars and community leaders and called together a group of them to consider ways to strengthen the collection this committee which included the puerto rican born bibliophile arthur a schomburg decided to set up a permanent noncirculating collection of books about black people  p  this small collection became the nucleus for a worthy negro department on may   the collection was dedicated as the division of negro literature history and prints in a ceremony attended by library officials community leaders and the public  p  at the time of its establishment the division was the only one of its kind in any public library rose comments about the collection at the presentation were prophetic  she recognized the importance of this reference collection not only for black people for whom it would give a sense of place and history but also for whites as well who she believed needed to know more about black people so that their prejudices would die of malnutrition above all she thought this reference collection was important because it would be available equally to scholars to the man in the street and to school children of all races  two years after the division was established a grant of  from the carnegie corporation was negotiated by the national urban league and encouraged by rose and the committee to enable the new york public library to purchase the private collection of books manuscripts pamphlets and etchings by and about black people assembled over a lifetime of collecting by arthur a schomburg  p  schomburg   was a zealous collector of black history and literature the international nature of his collection the variety of materials and the rarity of some of them made it a valuable and prestigious purchase schomburg was appointed curator of the division in  where he remained until his death after which the division was renamed the schomburg collection  p  rose prophecy about the value of this collection and its use was illustrated one year after its purchase she commented as public interest curiosity and sincere desire for information about the negro have grown there has been an opportunity to disseminate accurate facts and a growing demand for them by readers  p  it was through the dissemination of this information that rose believed race relations would be served this is the library big opportunity for it may help to inform both groups it has the channels of information and it may find the services and so do its bit toward the righteous adjustment of america least understood and most serious social situation  p  white and black students and scholars came to use the library and to
 the library quarterly attend its programs the library served as a clearinghouse for information about publishing it exhibited paintings by black artists and provided space for the production of plays by black dramatists the staff prepared and distributed reading lists about all facets of black life as needed or requested black and white scholars gave lectures on black history and literature and special programs for children were held  pp   this encouragement and support for writers were especially appreciated langston hughes the noted poet who first came to harlem in  remembered rose as a warm and wonderful librarian  who made newcomers feel welcome  p  work with negroes round table american library association rose recognized that the prevailing attitude among most librarians toward library service for blacks was one of indifference or when faced with community demand most librarians saw it as a problem rose did not consider working in the interest of blacks a problem she saw them as people who should be treated as human beings who expressed the same desires for social and personal acceptance and intellectual growth as any other people  p  rose convened the first meeting of a group of librarians within the american library association for the purpose of exchanging ideas and discussing issues about working with blacks  p  the group work with negoes round table met annually for three years at the association convention rose was temporary chairman at the first meeting in  the minutes taken by rose stated that there was considerable demand for such a discussion and the members present voted unanimously to set up a permanent round table in preparation for the meeting in  and to obtain information about the status of library work with blacks in other cities rose and the staff at the th street branch sent a questionnaire to  public libraries  p  ninety eight libraries responded to the survey which asked five questions the percentage of blacks in the population the status of open or restricted access to the library on the basis of race the provision of specialized services such as book collections about blacks the means of training black assistants and the participation of blacks on governing boards the replies showed that public library service to blacks varied greatly depending on a given city geographical location and the size of the black community in that city large cities with nonsegregated libraries in the north east and west with sizable black communities reported
white librarian in harlem  greater efforts than in prior years to provide specialized services and to hire black assistants on the other hand library services to blacks in southern cities were segregated and inadequate compared to library services elsewhere neither southern nor northern libraries reported black participation on governing boards the report concluded that public library services for blacks overall needed development and that there was a pressing need for professional training of black library workers  from the first meeting of the round table it was evident that widely differing methods of operating and standards of service existed among the various libraries the report bore this out further individual reports from librarians from other parts of the country who attended the meetings reflected the social and cultural prejudices of their regions the regional differences in attitudes toward black people and the kind of library service they wanted and needed was a point of disagreement among the members of the group rose presentations of the record of the th street branch and her humanitarian support of black people rights to the kind of library service her branch offered clearly differed from those of the southerners as a northerner and a liberal she was a dominating presence rose viewed herself as an advocate and authority on library services to blacks and was justly proud of her accomplishments with an integrated staff shared governance with community leaders and a unique collection of books about blacks thus it is not surprising that the round table met for the last time in  most of the librarians agreed that the negro question is a sectional one and that the south must approach it from its own angle  p  in this statement lies the key to the discontinuation of the round table one can only surmise that a catalyst for the group demise was rose method of fighting prejudice her militant and confrontational style nevertheless rose continued to be an active participant in american library association activities in the interest of improving race relations and adult education in  she was one of a team selected by the president of the american library association to study the merits of reconsidering a council resolution passed in  which required that conference hotels agree to provide equal access to all members regardless of race  p  they recommended no change in the resolution  p  as a member and chairman of the ala adult education board she presented the first library bill of rights to the  annual conference in san francisco  p  the library bill of rights expressed views that fueled the work that rose had done in harlem during the s and which she continued until her retirement in  this manifesto stated that library collections should be selected for the interest of the
 the library quarterly people in the community regardless of their race or nationality that library materials should represent all views and that as an institution with the mission to educate for democratic living the library meeting rooms should be open to all regardless of beliefs or affiliation  p  harlem experiment in adult education for ten years rose enterprising leadership with the assistance of community leaders had made the th street branch famous and respected as a social cultural and educational center this was recognized again in  when the branch was selected by the american association of adult education as one of two public libraries the other was the auburn branch of the atlanta public library for an experiment in adult education both were supported by funds from the carnegie corporation and the julius rosenwald fund  p  this grant was a boon for rose and her staff the economic depression had curtailed branch library budgets and support for programming  p  faced with an aging building and cutbacks in staff rose was allowed to augment and remotivate the staff and to redefine the branch programs to meet the community needs at a time of deepening social and economic malaise that these funds were addressed specifically for adult education gave an additional aura of prestige to the branch programs for the education of black adults fell far behind adult education for whites  p  even programs under black auspices such as those in churches schools and social and civic organizations had failed to turn around some of the problems of blacks in urban areas high illiteracy and dropout rates and maladjustment to city life  p  one reviewer of the experiment explained that the public library with its reputation for coordination of group activities and community acceptance would be a worthy agency for urban adult education for blacks   p  the first project of its kind the experiment was given national coverage in the black press for example the chicago defender hailed the experiment with the headline harlem launches big adult education program and described the organization of the project as a cooperative relationship between the public library and the community  p  rose as both branch librarian and executive director of this new venture worked with fourteen men and women from the community who made up the harlem adult education committee its purpose was to set policy and give counsel to the staff which included two field secretaries a
white librarian in harlem  readers adviser a curator and a secretary the field secretaries set up educational programs in cooperation with other groups and organizations and directed the library sponsored programs such as the forums on public affairs parenting institutes art and theater workshops a community chorus and the outdoor street forums the readers adviser responsible for the clearinghouse function of the project maintained a list of educational opportunities throughout the city she provided reading lists for individuals study groups and classes and wrote a column what to read carried by several black newspapers  p  as a recognized authority on the negro schomburg interpreted and promoted the collection through reference work and lectures  p  his presence further enhanced the appeal of the program to a broad spectrum of people in the community rose faced a number of problems not the least of which was how effective the public library could be as an agency of adult education she wrote libraries to be sure have always been active in educational service to adults but it is library service not the education of the adult which has been prominent in the minds of librarians as well as in those of the public at large  p  looking back on the experiment and putting herself in concert with the committee she continued the librarian and the advisory committee responsible for guiding the policies of this experiment had themselves to learn the character of adult education and how it might best be conducted from a library background while setting up a program of adult education  she and the committee were faced with appealing to a broad spectrum of users the working class and the middle class the illiterate and the educated those who would never think of coming to the library and those who made frequent use of its resources finally they had to decide whether to stress cultural educational or vocational programs the decision to reach every group that needed help and to give it the particular help it wanted rose admitted later could not be fulfilled but rather than err by limiting outreach to a particular group or to stress one kind of activity over the other the committee was bold enough to try them all  p  this overexpansion however was a major weakness of the program with so much going on the programs duplicated themselves and overlapped others in the community many programs did not appeal to the masses and there were not enough trained teachers  p  the cultural programs rose said held the balance of power in the program  p  even those critical of the program agreed that the creative informal and practical activities in arts crafts music and dramatics were the most successful because they boosted morale  p
 the library quarterly  the grant period ended in  but rose kept the committee and the staff and integrated the activities into the general program for adults at the branch ever mindful of changing community needs rose pressed for the renovation of the old carnegie building in order to ensure improved library services once again she enlisted the aid of a citizens committee which negotiated with the city administration for ten years finally the annex to the th street branch was completed and dedicated at a ceremony attended by city officials librarians publishers writers artists and friends on may    p  this modern addition to the old building with its spacious community rooms a gallery for exhibits and an auditorium was a monument to rose presence her ability to work with groups and her accomplishments associates friends and professional colleagues acknowledged her leadership on behalf of harlem in letters to her on the occasion of the dedication her longtime friend alain locke addressed her as my dear miss rose and wrote my best wishes for the occasion and for the continued success and expansion under your devoted leadership of the community work of the harlem library center for years it has been an outstanding and pioneering public service  and from the noted negro renaissance author claude mckay you have accomplished a great educatonal work in harlem and i like to congratulate you upon this final achievement to which always your name will be linked   and from florence rising curtis formerly director of the hampton library school came a telegram with regrets that she could not attend regret unable to join you in celebration of such important event in library record of service to city and nation  conclusion rose was a pioneer during the s and s in providing library services to the black community of harlem she accomplished this by helping to develop a book collection about the literature and history of black people by encouraging the hiring and training of black librarians and by working with community leaders to plan and implement cultural and social events and adult education programs in the library although other public libraries in urban black neighborhoods used similar patterns of service the th street branch in the largest and most famous black community was the cultural center during the negro renaissance when art music drama and writing by blacks flourished rose exploited this convergence of creative and intellectual expression in the harlem of the s and s she reached out to writers artists
