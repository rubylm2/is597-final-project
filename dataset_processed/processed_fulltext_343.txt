volume xxxv april  number  urban public library services for adults of low education peter hiatt t he responsibility for the continuing education of adults has been a persistent article of public library faith today public libraries in urban areas are faced by increasingly difficult problems many of these problems result from the departure of comparatively well educated individuals and their replacement by less educated residents librarians have been seriously handicapped by a lack of knowledge of how these people of low education who normally make little use of books and libraries can be reached a few public libraries have attempted to reach such people by specially adapting services the present study investigates the response that readers of limited education have made to specially adapted library services the background public libraries profess among their long standing goals the encouragement of continuous self education for all age groups they are especially concerned to improve people ability to participate usefully in community activities and to equip persons for efficient activities in useful occupations and practical affairs the newest immigrants to our cities need to be assimilated into the main stream of american culture if urban public libraries are to realize this philosophy it is necessary to encourage these people to use libraries this of course should not sound new to librarians philip hauser a sociologist long concerned with public libraries points to the public library as a highly significant agency among the various institutions which will assist the negro in making this basic transition in his way of life he was speaking of the rural negro suddenly transplanted to an urban setting since the early eighteenth century the phenomenon of new cultural groups coming into a city and replacing groups who have moved out has become the  this article was drawn from the author public library branch services for adults of low education phd thesis rutgers university new brunswick new jersey  low education is defined as schooling not beyond the eighth grade hilip m hauser community developments and their effect on library planning library quarterly xxvii   
 the library quarterly typical pattern and public libraries serving urban areas in the  have been faced with the departure of a large proportion of the library normal public and the influx of groups with a less literate background given workable methods the library can be one of the institutions which contributes directly to the education growth and adjustment of these groups the first step in such a process should be the development of interest in using libraries in its  annual report the enoch pratt free library describes the new baltimoreans who have not long been residents of the city and make special use of the library the report notes the flow of southern migrants with limited education as well as indigenous cultural patterns which create special problems in the use and abuse of books not only must the ever growing student body in schools and colleges be served but also the increasing numbers of citizens of lower income and little schooling unfamiliar with the services of enoch pratt they may not take proper advantage of them or when they do all too often may abuse them the library must provide materials to help the educational level of the city rise this does not mean lowering the standards of book selection but it does mean more vocational material more scientific and mechanical books on all levels to be used by adults who wish to study for high school equivalence tests and easy reading books for many adults who need to learn the mechanics of reading and to understand what is being read fulfilling this role with underprivileged newcomers is made difficult not only by their educational level and occupational patterns a large body of research shows that people with limited education are not the most hopeful candidates for heavy library use studies of reading as well as of library use have indicated a direct correlation between a low level of education and low use of books and libraries in addition many of the urban newcomers are involved in occupations which seldom require the use of a library the picture is not entirely dark in a study made in  henry c link found that  per cent of adults with eighth grade education or less and in the lower income category are contrary to popular opinion active readers furthermore  per cent of adults with eighth grade education or less of all income levels read one book or more a month although many question that these figures would be valid today perhaps better than  per cent of those of both low education and low income are book users the library ought to adapt its services in order to stimulate increased patronage in low education urban areas indeed in order to fulfil its article of faith the library must so adapt its services community profiles two branch libraries located in depressed areas of different cities illustrate such programs of special services the carnegie west branch of the cleveland public library cw and the pennsylvania avenue branch of the enoch pratt free library of baltimore pa each of these two branches  enoch pratt free library annual report  baltimore  p   bernard berelson who uses the library in his the library public new york columbia university press  pp   enry c link people and books a study of reading and book buying habits new york book industry committee book manufacturers institute  p 
adults of low education  serves a low education area with a specially adapted program of services significantlv both branches have adult registration percentages higher than a sample of metropolitan branch libraries which serve similar areas but which have made no special attempt to adapt services the characteristics of the communities they serve are similar in many ways and are representative of such communities in urban areas around the nation both libraries serve a primarily residential community with a median educational level of  grades well below the national median of  grades both communities are characterized by rapid change and mobility in baltimore  per cent of the branch area population had lived in a different house in  and in cleveland  per cent more than one third of the housing in both communities is deteriorating or dilapidated and the typical family in these communities earned about  in  more than half of those in the labor force are operatives laborers or service workers inversely the number holding professional and related jobs is very low the unemployment rate for the two communities in  was  in baltimore and  in cleveland dramatically higher than the median for the nation churches of various denominations are well represented in both communities and store front churches are unusually common recreational facilities are below minimum standards librarians noted the reticence with which adults venture out in the evenings in baltimore and the staff in cleveland spoke of vandalism in  for example the library was broken into seven times pa serves a part of baltimore sometimes called the gray area an area typified by high crime and unemployment rates social alienation low level of communication and language skills poor nutritional and health standards and limited access of facilities for selfhelp it is predominately negro  per cent the only local groups and clubs are neighborhood clubs and these have been formed for protection rather than for neighborhood improvement thus the branch serves an underorganized low education changing negro community characterized further by a subculture holding values and customs which differ from those of the urban middle class many suffer from the problems of transiency of educational and cultural handicaps divorce chronic illness mental illness and delinquency many also lack motivation and capacity to cope with their problems or to become responsible citizens the cw community is a depressed area too but it is a better arranged community as will appear in subsequent accounts services both branches have adapted services to fit the special needs problems and interests of their communities in general both put a great deal of emphasis on work with community organizations and agencies especially those concerned with or composed of adults who have completed only an elementary statistics drawn from several tables in  volumes of the us bureau of the census us censuses of population and howsing  census tracts final report phcl baltimore md and final report phc cleveland ohio i health and welfare coundl of the baltimore area inc a letter to ourselves a master plan for human redevelopment baltimore 
 the library quarterly school education both branches are well located and have an above average collection each has an exceptional professional staff with a highly imaginative flexible library philosophy and an objective inquiring attitude toward its professional work at pa there are six professional librarians available for specialized service to children teen agers and adults the division between clerical and professional duties is well drawn as is the separation of professional responsibilities toward various age groups yet there is also strong co ordination the caliber of the staff is unusually high the administration has placed some of the enoch pratt top quality personnel in this particular branch the staff is challenged by its responsibilities and continues to learn how to meet them the approach to service is one of broad coverage wide range flexibility and continuous experimentation individual patrons are served in their many capacities the librarians are on constant alert to approach and offer assistance to each patron and a variety of group services is offered existing groups both library sponsored groups and other area wide organizations and agencies serve as one of the branch major continued community contacts the quality of service at cw also is high librarians are available for children teen agers and adults but the system administrative organization does not facilitate co ordination of branch services to all age groups the branch children librarian is not immediately responsible to the branch librarian but rather to the cleveland system children librarian branch co ordination of work with teen agers and adults is strong unlike the baltimore branch clerical duties are occasionally shared by the professional staff as in pa co operation with other community agencies is fundamental to the cw concept of library services both branches can show attitudes resources and services that distinguish them as special agencies for serving adults with low education these include special emphasis on philosophy of service a series of self studies adaptation of the collections and continued construction maintenance and renovation of the buildings the staffs of both libraries participate in local community and professional organizations the background attitudes and the availability of special resources permeate such individual services as floor work and at cw the making of book annotations and handling registration they enter also such group services as book displays both in and out of the library staff talks outside of the library cw the compilation of such lists as readable books for adult students pa magic of music series pa and evening film series cwto name some typical services both branches have provided children and young adults services for adults although pa programs in this area are both more extensive and enduring method to study the impact of these special services a sample of library users was selected for interview in depth subjects for interview consisted of people using the library during a specific two week period a desk was located at a point where all adults passed but removed enough from the activity of the library to permit the interviewee to feel he
adults of low education  could not be overheard each person was told that a study of the library was being made and that if he would answer a few questions it would be helpful a few opening questions were designed to gather generally useful information and to weed out those of more than eighthgrade education of  adults interviewed in both branches  adults of low education were given depth interviews since the purpose of this study was to determine which service could be seen to have encouraged library use among adults of low education it was not deemed necessary to create a control group the significant finds from the method are the individual responses to adapted services such a method does not of course permit definitive generalization nor does it allow for an extensive survey of low education adult library users rather it is an important first step that identifies those services which were found to have had impact on particular readers the interviewer sought to find examples of adults with low education who had been affected by library services the interview hours were planned to allow a maximum range of interview opportunities during september   interviews were conducted for  hours during two weeks at pa in october  for  hours at cw time schedules were arranged to avoid the teen age influx in the late afternoons all those of eighth grade education or less were given intensive interviews in order to determine important characteristics of likely pertinence to library use to determine how the library had first been brought to their attention and to reveal the factors that had encouraged initial use of the library the interviews served to identify elements which had encouraged interest and use of the library by these semi educated adults for each adult of eighth grade education or less an understanding of his motives and need for library use was developed through an interview schedule designed to clarify the catalyst circumstances and sequence of events which brought him to the library special focus was placed on his first use of the particular branch library as well as his previous use of other libraries he was asked when he had first visited this branch and which of the services he had used in order to determine the relation of the library program of services to his interest in the library as a major key to findings the interview schedule was subject to many revisions and was tested in a loweducation neighborhood in newark new jersey the final schedule allowed for needed flexibility it was in two parts the first a brief identification giving some useful information allowed for courteous but quick dismissal of people not pertinent to the study the final form of the interview schedule a detailed explanation of each question and the reasoning behind it runs to many pages and may be consulted in the dissertation from which this report has been abstracted response of readers of limited education to special library services an analysis of the seventy nine interviews with adults of eighth grade edui such characteristics were sought for as occupation organizational membership educational level place and length of residence age sex race and community involvement
 the library quarterly cation or less revealed that several adapted services were a primary factor in encouraging library use by these adults  per cent of the total seventynine interviews showed a direct relationship between library interest and adapted services and  per cent showed an indirect relationship in other words services to the special needs and interests of adults of limited education are clearly evident the number of interviews with answers which relate to specific library policies is summarized in tables  and  a discussion of each service follows it was found that several individually adapted services encouraged use it was also found that various elements of these specific services were often linked together to form patterns which had encouraged library use this paper then will discuss examples of interview responses to illustrate both findings first let us consider individual services branch location in depressed area the very location of a branch in a depressed problem neighborhood greatly encourages visits to the library such a location was deliberately selected for the branch sites in baltimore pa and in cleveland cw the pa branch newly built and the cw branch more than fifty years old extensively refurbished and given additional support eighteen per cent of those interviewed said this location directly affected their library use for example one woman had started to use the library as soon as she moved back into the neighborhood two years previously libraries table  relationship between library use by adults of low education and adapted services no of interviewees affected by service service baltimore cleveland branch branch total pa cw decision to locate a high quality branch library in a low education neighborhood   na  individual services accessibility of librarians as revealed in the user asking for help as a part of his library use     building rapport and approaching each adult in an effort to make adults of low education comfortable and at ease in library use    mailing list and newspaper notices    selection of easy reading material with adult interest   na  group services film programs o  t   other programs  na   program planning conference  i na   a chronology of service for a ten year period was created for both branches by examining all records and reports available by talking with the library system administrators and by interviewing the branch librarian and her staff the information gained was added to and refined by observation of services and by examination of the collection a preliminary checklist of elements of services which could be adapted to adults of low education was used as a final check for completeness a summary of services and a chronology of the development of these services were then made for use during interviews t none offered in baltimore for past  years
adults of low education  were too far when i didn live here so i didn use any now that ie moved across the street ie started to use the library to help my girl with reading this secondary motivation is important too as we will see later a sixtyyear old pin setter who is a steady reader uses the cw branch because it is a block from the bowling alley others also cited location as a major factor in their library use the library was conveniently located near work home or transportation philosophy of service staffing hours and philosophy of service play an important role in encouragement of library use both branches investigated are staffed with top quality personnel have full hours and full staff these factors allow for the development of a program of services crucial in the development of library use among those interviewed furthermore the philosophy of the professional staff gave direction to the available talent and opportunity each staff displayed initiative in experimentation questioning co operation and conscious wish to make the library an integral part of its community both staffs welcome and initiate re evaluation of the changing reading needs of their communities both branches accept involvement in their communities problems and development as a basic concern from this philosophy considerable emphasis has been put on work with neighborhood organizations and agencies some of these activities need to be described before their impact can be understood pa serves an area that is not only underorganized but in which no truly community wide groups exist several outside agencies are concerned with the table  elements of library service encouraging library use among adults of low education no op interviewees affected elements of library senqces balticlevemore land toa branch branch total pa cw accessibility of librarians    location of branch     physical layout of branch    group programs    hunganan collection na   hospitals and institutions service   general collection    community as a whole the urban renewal agency is one the branch librarian and her staff work closely with leaders of urban renewal in an effort to understand better their community and to help in its improvement as well as to interpret and relate the library program of services the library is used for meetings of the agency the staff has participated in distribution of materials in and outside of the library and it has continually stressed the library role in community improvement traditional services such as window displays and booklists are of course important but this interrelation of the urban renewal staff and the librarians is probably more significant recently the urban renewal and hous both the pennsylvania avenue branch and the carnegie west branch have been continously involved in formal and informal self studies concerned with hours collection use and perhaps most significant the changing background interests needs and problems of the areas they serve
 the library quarterly ing agency made house to house inspections and noted improvements that would be required in order to foster these improvements an area recognition program was started neighborhoods that had done an outstanding job of improvement were selected for recognition the branch co operated with the agency in creating a display that showed what can be done and how it can be done credit was then given to those who did an outstanding job the agency held meetings on home improvement at the library and the branch supplied lists and displays of appropriate materials to supplement the agency explanation of how to make and finance such improvements economically program planning institute in an area where only highly local neighborhood organizations exist the need for wider involvement is pressing recognizing that in its community church groups are often well organized and supply much community leadership pa co sponsored a program planning institute for church leaders long a staple in enoch pratt conception of positive library leadership the machinery for setting up such a program is readily available in order to determine what would be most desired by the church leaders who wanted to learn how to plan and conduct programs in the area questionnaires were sent out noting what the library could do and asking which of these activities the leaders would like to select some of the items listed were book reviews book lists film presentations displays sixty representatives from thirty churches then participated in a three hour program a presentation on how to conduct a discussion group and how to use films in a program was followed by an explanation and demonstration of book reviewing and a general presentation on how to plan various kinds of programs although planned and executed as a program for other community agencies and not individuals per se this program introduced people to library use a negro steam generator operator in his early sixty a church leader despite his eighth grade education level was an example he had been using another branch for four years that is be has two children who in progressing from elementary school to high school were told by their teacher to use the public library he started taking them to his neighborhood branch i used to bring them to the library and wait he brought his children to that branch for three years he went into it and he waited inside for them it never occurred to him to use the library himself this might have remained his level of library use indefinitely interestingly enough he was unable at first to recall the reason for which he started to use the library for himself i got so as i looked around and then came to the conclusion that i could get books however as we talked further about various library services it slowly became apparent to him that the program planning conference had been the turning point he was unable to identify the program beyond the recollection that it was a meeting on how to get people to talk and it was after attending the program that he began to borrow books for his church teaching the church in which he holds his classes is one block from the library and not in the neighborhood of his home it is
adults of low education  significant that he turned to this branch instead of the one his children use asked if he used the library for any other purposes he said that the thought had not occurred to him before although he was not clear about it apparently he uses his neighborhood branch in his role as mentor taking his children to the library and this branch in his avocational role as church leader whereas this interview points up in a tangible manner the success of enoch pratt philosophy and techniques i could discover no such startling evidence for cleveland nonetheless the vital role of the cleveland branch as a participating agency in community leadership should not be underestimated it serves through both staff membership and professional leadership in the west side community council and the west side civic council and offers a series of programs to preschool children as well as to older people with local agencies co operation with the puerto rican affairs committee and as a result with a local spanish speaking teacher in the public schools in order to promote the use of the public library by puerto ricans was initiated in  although no immediate direct results of these programs were found among the individuals interviewed the programs are not aimed at this individual level rapport it should be noted again that both branches put unusual emphasis on individual contact with adults the librarians make constant efforts to establish rapport and to make adults in their difficult neighborhoods feel comfortable in using the library the success of this effort was evident in many of the interviews  per cent revealed that their individual contact with the librarian offered vital encouragement to their library use the importance of building such rapport in a low education neighborhood is well illustrated by an unemployed negro in his mid twenties who has but an eighth grade education he first came into the library because he had seen it under construction and was curious about the building i like the librarians here the people theye very nice that why i keep coming back the day he was interviewed he had come to the library only to show the librarian his new child according to the assistant branch librarian he had been coming to the branch for some time and had been a real problemmaker when a teen ager some of the female staff members were afraid of him the assistant librarian added that his reading ability was low that he is in and out of jobs and comes to the library mostly to kill time the staff had made particular efforts first to control him and later to win his confidence the assistant librarian confirmed the interviewee statement that he took books from the display designed for literacy classesreadable books for adult students this interviewee has been encouraged to use the library and has had his interest in library use sustained because of two services adapted for people with little schooling the emphasis on building rapport and the adult easy reading collection this can be seen again in the case of a negro housewife in her mid fifties who had a fifth grade education she had attempted in  to use another branch library but had been imme

 the library quarterly study adults of low education who had long been book users more investigation about the reading habits of loweducation adults would give valuable knowledge to librarians working in such neighborhoods many large communities are facing problems of shifting population with the resulting influx of adults who traditionally have been labeled non users the present study has pointed to the feasibility of adapting adult services it would be worthwhile next to set up an adapted well supported pilot program of adult services in a library serving a culturally deprived community in order to determine just how effective a fully developed program could be in encouraging library use among the adults interviewed unemployment and retirement combined to be the largest occupational category what is the relation of leisure time to library use is there a direct correlation between library use and leisure or are there other more basic factors that underlie this apparent relationship the findings point to an extremely important generalization the central role of a professional librarian at a branch outlet who is sympathetic to the special needs problems personalities and desires of these people can do much to encourage potential readers to become active library users again and again the central role of personal professional contact at a particular point in the development of library use was demonstrated whether a film program a program planning conference a special collection skilful publicity branch location or a friend initiated interest in the library it was usually the professional librarian who had the catalytic role the usual pattern of library service in low education problem areas has not brought results most libraries meet reduced use and lowering circulation by cutting back professional staff this probably causes only further reduction in the use and effectiveness of the library in the two branch libraries studied the strengthening of resources staffing with top quality professionals and an imaginative adapted program of adult services resulted in increased use and important participation by the library in its community affairs specially adapted services can lead to increased library use by adults of low education whether a library administrator chooses to attempt to reverse a decline in use and whether he believes adults of low education to be a basic concern of the public library must depend on his philosophy of library service there is enough indication of the effectiveness of adapting services and of the vital role of the professional librarian to promise potential success if the library profession is to continue to meet its long expressed obligation to reach and serve its public it must demonstrate flexibility energy and imagination adults of low education who want to read deserve to be reached baltimore pennsylvania avenue branch and cleveland carnegie west branch illustrate some techniques that librarians faced with similar problems can utilize increasing registration at these two branches should encourage similar branches to try these techniques i cyril houle in the inquiring mind madison university of wisconsin press  pp  has suggested that they are mavericks w s gray and b rogers in maturity in reading chicago university of chicago press  p  have proposed that there is a relation between community involvement and reading
