 the library quarterly european scholarship because european libraries are generally much smaller and grow much more slowly i do not know if any librarian or scholar actually holds this conviction but the divergence in size of european and american libraries raises these questions are the huge collections made in america really necessary do they contribute to scholarly progress as much as their defenders insist they do are the time the energy the manpower and the money spent in their acquisition organization and servicing rationally expended or could these expenditures be spent in more fruitful ways will collections reaching into the millions and increasing at an alarming rate remain intellectually viable do we help the advancement of scholarship with these mammoth collections or do we contribute to its suffocation the gravity of these questions makes all the other problems libraries face seem puny in comparison the questions are particularly important because of recent advances in techniques before we go too deeply into automation or information retrieval we should be sure that we know not only in which fields such techniques are sensible but before that what is worth committing to the memory of the computer the computer will no doubt be able to handle quantity faster and better than today librarian but it will be even less able to differentiate between quantity and quality only adequately educated human intellect can do that iii basically three arguments are advanced to justify a policy that leads to the gigantic collections in the united states they are  the ideal of a research collection is completeness meaning the acquisition of the entire output of the printing presses of the past the present and the future and in addition great quantities of manuscripts  the library collects not only for the present but also for the future for all future  a research library never becomes obsolete the chorus of american librarians wlho defend this ideal of comprehensiveness is so great that one feels like a   c dunn w f seibert and janice a scheuneman the past and likely future of  research libraries   a statistical study of growth and change lafayette ind university libraries and audio visual center purdue university  this valuable study should be required reading for every librarian concerned with book selection since it might frighten him into re evaluating his policies the study shows that book collections even of the largest libraries are growing at alarming rates which give no indication of slowing down a samuel a goudsmit is the literature worth retrieving physics today september   goudsmit makes the interesting point that in physics only review articles and data compilations should be committed to the memory of the computer since original articles seldom are a helpful source of information their nomenclature and techniques become obsolete within a few years with the result that they are not understood by later generations  only a few typical references can be cited here the interested reader is referred to the sources cited in danton book rollin a sawyer book selection in the reference department of the new york public library college and research libraries december   the ideal objective of such a library is a complete record of human thought emotion and action    it should have everything changing patterns of scholarship antd the future of research libraries a symposium in celebration of the th anniversary of the establishment of the university of pennsylvania library philadelphia university of pennsylvania press  crane brinton expects the library to collect everything since there is a new demand for the tenth rate meaningless trivial trash or worse pp   in the same symposium verner w clapp remarks it may seem wholly unrealistic to discuss this ideal of comprehensiveness but i
an argument for selectivity g heretic even to question it yet taoist philosophy says when you can see a reason for doubting at a point where no one has hitherto seen a reason for doubting then you are making progress our most urgent task today is to question this ideal as long as librarians accept comprehensiveness as an ideal and believe that no argument other than expediency particularly financial expediency can be advanced against it the ideal of comprehensiveness will haunt the profession like a ghost and will influence the acquisition policy of every american institution it is therefore essential to realize that decisive intellectual reasons contradict this ideal and unmask it as a dangerous dogma iv the urge to preserve an object assumes it has value it can have subjective value in which case the number of valuable objects is as limitless as are individual tastes and preferences on the other hand it can be considered worth saving for its value in relation to some ideal to which a community subscribes without the differentiation between subjective and objective value no intellectual basis for a collection policy in any kind of public library can exist without criteria to differentiate between the good and the bad the worthwhile and the worthless the necessary and the superfluous book collecting becomes a race for quantity between competing institutions we do not know when libraries started but they originated at a time when writing was a difficult and cumbersome art mastered by only a few members of the intellectual elite in consequence only that which was important was written down it was written down to be preserved to be written and to be valuable were synonymous this awe for the written word lingers on today in the ideal of comprehensiveness the discovery of printing devaluated the written word it eliminated the quality of uniqueness which handwritten manuscripts possessed and it initiated a social and intellectual revolution that even today is far from finished formerly the monopoly of an intellectual elite reading and writing became accessible to ever greater numbers of the masses they became available to the intellectually mediocre and to the less than mediocre in consequence publishing became big business and books became an economic commodity in which the salability and not the inherent value was the decisive element it should be pointed out that the often mentioned syndrome publish or perish is not the only and perhaps not think we must do so from time to time if only to make clear to ourselves how far from the ideal we are    for practical purposes the sole control upon our collecting is the restraining power of the budget bureau pp   lawrence s thompson the dogma of book selection in university libraries college and research libraries november    it seems to be generally recognized that if a library is to be a research library in the best sense it must be comprehensive in its fields of emphasis including good bad and indifferent thompson proposes that the librarian should not select individual titles but should pursue mass collecting in fields of interest danton op cit n  above p  the author is convinced that only arguments of expediency can be advanced against the concept of comprehensiveness these arguments have neither intellectual nor educational nor philosophical validity  karl loffler allgemeine handschriftenkunde in georg leyh ed handbuch op cit n  above    he points out that even copies of manuscripts are unique because they have physical characteristics that are of great importance to the scholar who studies them
 the library quarterly even the primary contributor to the flow of superfluous graphic records the publishers need to keep their presses going thus they entice authors into writing books for which they have no inner urge and into organizing periodicals for which there is no intellectual necessity to maintain under these circumstances that comprehensiveness is an ideal means that one has substituted for the original goal of the library to collect what is valuable the goal to collect what is being printed in our fast moving age even conventional publishing has become too slow or selective a process xeroxed or typewritten manuscripts preprints and the invisible college gradually displace the nonopoly of the printed word and supply additional headaches for the libraries and for the scholarly community the overemphasis on authorship in our bibliographical apparatus obscures both the fact that libraries are essentially institutions for the preservation of thought processes and the fact that the value of these thought processes is independent from the form in which they appear and from the individuals who create them ever lengthening author lists on title pages should forewarn us our whole bibliographical technique may be on the road to obsolescence the time is perhaps not far off when as a consequence of increasing team authorship subject bibliographies will become the focus of our bibliographical organization this will automatically direct attention again to the essential reason for the preservation of a graphic record naimely its contents perhaps this will make exclusion of what has no value more likely v in the balance of conflicting interests in building collections comprehensiveness versus selectivity verner w clapp says the case  for everything is never quite proven just as it is never quite disproved it seems to me that the very development and growth of scholarship offer of themselves decisive testimony that the ideal of comprehensiveness is not valid since there never was a time which had everything and there never will be a time which has everything we would have no scholarship at all if everything were a prerequisite for its production our studies of previous generations are not only based on incomplete records they are often based on tiny fragments of graphic records and sometimes on no graphic records at all these lacunae did not make scholarship impossible on the contrary they taught the inquiring mind to develop methods by which to combine graphic records artifacts works of art and bits of all kinds of information so as to reconstruct the intellectual social and physical history of man the incompleteness of the records stimulates thinking imagination and ingenuity develops sagacity critical analysis and judgment and fosters scholarship we might know more about certain periods of the past if we had more complete records but consideration of the past and projection into the future should make us reconsider any ideal of comprehensive collecting of records ideally perhaps in order to provide  simon pasternak is journal publication obsolescent physics today may    pasternak defends the importance of the scientific journal against its erosion through mass distribution of unrefereed preprints n changing patterns op cit n  above pp

 the library quarterly vi the second argument used to justify the necessity for big even complete collections is the argument that we collect not only for the present but also the future for all future collecting for the future can mean different things in library parlance it is important to distinguish between these different meanings because confusion in this area contributes to our indiscriminate collecting  to collect for the future means in its simplest form to preserve the acquired graphic records for posterity since it is a purpose and function of the library to preserve graphic records and to pass them on to future generations no particular collection policy can be deduced from this statement  to collect for the future also means that the librarian should anticipate the demands of its clientele this is a legitimate function of selection policy and follows from the library function as a service institution if it is the task of the librarian to acquire those records which advance knowledge it is irrelevant whether and when the demand for such records is expressed the record contains new knowledge thus it is pertinent to the collection the important thing is that the librarian should know what constitutes new knowledge  the third legitimate meaning proceeds from the purpose and the essence of a university library a university library is by definition comprehensive in the sense that it has universal intellectual responsibilities parochialism and universality are excluding concepts therefore a university library cannot make its collection policy dependent upon the accident of whether a particular subject is being taught at a particular time in the particular institution the intellectual importance of a field does not depend on its representation in the curriculum this presupposes again that the librarian knows what is going on in the intellectual world  there is a fourth meaning to the phrase collecting for the future and it is this fourth meaning which contradicts the rational foundations of any collection policy it rests namely on the supposition that we somehow can foresee the future selection of books for a library like this harvard calls for an attempt to foresee the future course of research and to obtain publications that though they seem insignificant today will be wanted by scholars tomorrow while in the first three instances the material which we collect is or at least should be significant in the present according to the fourth definition we admit that the material is not important in the present but for one reason or the other we hope that it will become important in the future this hope rests on sand and it is therefore no wonder that a large amount of the material acquired for future use has never been used and may never be used we cannot anticipate to day what we shall only knzow tomorrow recent history demonstrates that the future has the tendency to outwit the speculations of the past and can take unexpected turns  danton op cit n  above p  the problem is not simply of the need fifty or even ten years hence but rather of all future need that is all need not specifically known today  paul buck in e e willianm ed libraries and universities addresses and reports cambridge mass the belknap press of harvard university press  p   keyes d metcalf in clhanging patterns op cit n  above pp    karl r popper the poverty of historicisn london routledge  kegan paul  p x italics in source
an argument for selectivity  in research methods research interests tastes and evaluations this is why collecting with the view to the future is an irrational undertaking on the other hand by preserving only what is important in the present we add our share not only to the advancement of knowledge but also to the social history of our age since what we deemed important will give future generations a clue to our interests feelings and thoughts while we do not know and cannot guess what will be appreciated in the future we do know that every book we purchase today adds to the size of the library to the expenses of all future books and to the growing complexity of our catalogs and library procedures each superfluous book purchased today adds its share toward endangering the viability of the library of tomorrow in the past such a collecting policy might have had a certain justification since a book not acquired in the present might have been unavailable if requested in the future in our age of photoduplication and general mobility of materials and persons this policy is an anchronism as much as the policy that maintains the ideal of comprehensiveness first expressed in the sixteenth century under totally different conditions it should perhaps be mentioned in passing that the trauma that has haunted librarians since mendel famous paper on genetics remained unnoticed for thirty four years does not prove that to prevent such an occurrence we should have all records on the contrary this event and many similar ones prove that having records available is no guarantee of their being read or of their significance being recognized when read if unnoticed discoveries prove anything they prove that smaller collections fully analyzed would be more important than large collections whose content remains unknown vii the awe for the written word that compels american libraries to buy much more than could be digested even if the number of scholars were much greater also expresses itself in a great reluctance to get rid of materials once purchased the research library never becomes obsolete the library is the university chief permanent investment are at best half truths very large parts of every library do become obsolete and their presence on the shelves is not only not a permanent investment but on the contrary an unnecessary drain on the resources of american institutions besides the presence of obsolete books counteracts the advantages of the open shelf policy that pride of american librarianship obsolete and insignificant books if looked at waste the time of the scholar and might misinform the would be scholar if not used they are superfluous the experience of german libraries proves convincingly that even collections selected with much greater care and restraint than are american collections become in time to a very large extent obsolete during world war ii germany lost  books from its university and technical libraries  per cent of the collections if we include the losses of the city and state libraries that to a great extent are research libraries supplementing the university libraries the losses totaled  volumes when the time came to replace these losses it turned out that a very large danton op cit n  above p   fritz redenbacher die erwerbung in georg leyh ed handbuch op cit n  above
