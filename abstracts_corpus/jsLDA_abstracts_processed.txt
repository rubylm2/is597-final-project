the place of reference service in ranganathans theory of librarianship	1976	s r ranganathan approached librarianship theoretically he sought to establish fundamental principles from which effective library practices could be systematically derived although he contended that he had discovered these principles his five laws of library science through a rigorous scientific process it is clear that they and the concept of librarianship based on them are more fundamentally the product of ranganathans hindu tradition ethical and metaphysical premises characteristic of hinduism are reflected in his conception of the social and cosmic purpose of the library and of reference service as the basic means of fulfilling that purpose ranganathan believed that effective reference service depended on the intuitive flair of the librarian and on the use of an analyticosynthetic classification scheme while the dependence of his concept of reference service on intuition lessened its practical value for american librarians both his discussion of analyticosynthetic classification and the broad perspective from which he speaks are potentially important contributions to the understanding and practice of reference service in american libraries

promoting reflexivity and inclusivity in archival education research and practice	2010	the area of archival studies today transcends the professional field of archival science it encompasses an ever broadening array of disciplinary discussions and methodological approaches that are identifying critiquing and addressing the shifting social cultural philosophical and political as well as the technological imperatives of record keeping and remembering in the twenty first century reporting on two recent research projects and three ongoing educational initiatives this article suggests ways in which research and education in archival studies can play a central role in promoting more reflexive and inclusive ideas practices and research not only within the archival profession but also within the various library and information science lis and ischool settings in which archival education and research might be situated
censorship and childrens literature	1983	the present arguments over censorship of books for the young reveal among other things the conflicts in current social attitudes toward childhood and children this essay attempts to place such arguments in some historical perspective it suggests that the relative peace that prevailed in the field of childrens literature from roughly 1900 to 1965 was the result of a broad consensus within the field about the needs of childhood and the function of literature for children that consensus was in turn the result of the general homogeneity of the people involved in the production and purchase of books for children agreement broke up in the mid 1960s when groups heretofore unconcerned with childrens books began to see their social and political implications enormous changes in the content of childrens literature followed with some paradoxical shifts in liberal conservative positions on censorship the 1980s promises to be a period of conflict as conservative reaction against the liberal trends of the 1970s tries to reverse an accomplished transformation in the literature
visualizing identities in lis literature	2018	this paper is based on statistical and qualitative analysis of library and information science lis literature our study asks the question of whether and if so how and how often the discourse generated by scholarly literature in lis engages discussion about identity in lis what topics are covered and whether the articles engage praxis or the application of theory to practice through searches in lista database that cross referenced identity terms eg gender lgbt with terms describing prominent areas in the lis field we collected quantitative data and analyzed the co occurrence of keywords and created network visualizations we used a qualitative coding scheme to rate abstracts in terms of their relevance and actionability both modes of analysis show that generalized conversations about identity are most common and praxis is rarely achieved using critical approaches to lis we explore the ramifications of silences within lis literature upon the pedagogical and professional discourse

the library in the lives of latino college students	2006	libraries share a perception of embracing and providing for all users however they also share a common philosophical stance shaped by librarians individual discursive formations and the dominant cultural hegemony that values some users over others latinos constitute one of the fastest growing nondominant populations in the united states and the literature suggests that libraries do not always serve them adequately this was reinforced by interviews with seven latino undergraduate students that suggest ambiguous feelings toward libraries and a strong need for some sort of cultural reinforcement this study of users perceptions of libraries may help librarians and policy makers consider more pluralistic approaches to library services

if diversity is a natural state why dont our libraries mirror the populations they serve	2015	synonyms for diversity include assortment difference distinctiveness medley unlikeness and variety note that not one of these terms includes the concept of quotas or force of any kind diversity is the natural state sameness and uniformity are unnatural diversity is not about color gender age language or sexual orientation it is about all of these things if we do not ensure that our libraries have frontline professionals who reflect the nature of the communities with which they work then we will lose valuable patrons they will turn instead to their neighbor who looks just like them regardless of whether or not they receive valid information from that person encouraging diversity and looking at things differently are some of the most important things libraries do as educational institutions this article explores ways to ensure that in the future our library and information professionals mirror the people they serve
negotiating borders	2017	recent developments in canada the united states and beyond continue to test librarians resolve and to redefine how we view ourselves and engage with communities drawing on examples from both canada and the united states and deploying the concept of border as an analytical trope we seek to probe and unsettle the geographic professional and ideological interfaces that librarians constantly negotiate in a world where data know no borders but indigenous and other bodies are constrained by them how do we respond to the calls to action of canadas truth and reconciliation commission to the violent displacement of millions of syrians to the resurgence of divisive politics and racist rhetorics or to the surrender to data using the trump election as a launching point we explore key drivers for change in lis in instances when politics spill into our professional purview

information literacy a contradictory coupling	2003	information literacy has established itself as an important subfield of librarianship yet although librarians justify information literacy as increasing democratic participation by all citizens their efforts to improve quality control of information also threaten to restrict choice in systematic ways this contradiction results in part from the genealogy of the terms information and literacy terms that share a relationship traceable to an enlightenment ideology namely that reading could transform society by informing its people but readings power to transform was also a contested issue for groups seeking political and cultural ascendancy and reading genres that initially challenged conventional thought evolved into those that buttressed it in the process some groups came to be defined as information consumers and simultaneously excluded from the role of information producers strategies that can raise awareness of the assumptions underlying this legacy include critical analysis of language use and envisioning information use as a process that involves all users in both consumption and production adopting these can help librarians recognize that the tensions inherent in the discourse and practice of information literacy are not only unavoidable but essential if the basic condition of democracy  citizen participation  is to be fulfilled

bibliographic instruction and mass media news literacy a theoretical background	1998	this article suggests that bibliographic instruction bi librarians consider integrating a mass media news literacy and awareness component into their teaching duties as the concentration of media power in the hands of a small number of corporate entities increases and as market driven management imperatives dominate publishing practices students should possess the skills to evaluate effectively and critically mass media sources such as main stream newspapers and magazines to this end a theoretical framework for understanding mass media news influence is offered the concepts of agenda setting priming framing asymmetrical selection binary oppositionalism and institutional hegemony are explored in a survey of relevant literature from the fields of journalism and communications a teaching strategy incorporating these concepts is sketched out the strategy highlights one news event and compares how different news sources report that event through such an exercise students will be able to recognize how different news frames affect understanding of the topic in question ultimately the successful bi program will be defined by the extent to which students move away from a passive reading of news media sources to a position where they are able to decode the social context of mainstream news production and develop informed and negotiated reading practices
books on the frontier the extent and nature of book ownership in southern indiana 1800 1850	1972	the quality of the cultural life of the american frontier has long been in dispute some historians argue that the frontier forced the pioneers to revert to a near barbaric stage while it divested them of all aspects of their former cultures others maintain with equal vigor that the society which developed on each frontier was very nearly a carbon copy of the settled areas further east and that the culture of americans had not been significantly altered by the frontier process most agree however that evidence testifying to the nature and extent of book ownership provides one means of measuring the progress of culture on the frontier this paper summarizes the results of an intensive study of this topic on the southern indiana frontier data were collected from a variety of sources but especially important were county probate records which often contained inventories indicating books owned by early indiana residents an examination of over 2000 inventories located in sixteen southern indiana counties produced descriptions of more than 500 private libraries an analysis of these libraries shows that the pattern of book ownership was not startingly different from that revealed by similar studies of book ownership in the american colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries clearly books were not impossible to acquire in early indiana and a sizable proportion of the estates inventoried in the counties studied contained books most of the collections were small and narrowly religious in nature with larger libraries still tending toward the utilitarian however a small number of inventories were discovered which listed large numbers of books a few men  those with both the means and the inclination  built large and well balanced libraries on the indiana frontier

the portrayal of librarians in obituaries at the end of the twentieth century	2004	obituaries can reveal much about the way a profession is conceived and structured in the popular imagination this article examines obituaries of librarians in the new york times between 1977 and 2002 to determine how librarians were presented to the general public by a major newspaper although librarianship is a femaleâ€intensive profession 634 percent of the obituaries chronicled the lives of male librarians although public and school librarians outnumber their academic counterparts obituaries focused on academic librarians far from creating a stereotypical portrait of librarians as shy dour dowdy and sheltered individuals the emphasis on large scale achievements in the obituaries produces an image of librarianship as a glamorous profession some librarians are presented as sleuths and detectives who amassed large collections they contributed to the progress of scholarly research with extensive publications many others had connections to prominent people making the most of these social networks in their work librarians were also players on the global stage founding libraries abroad and developing international guidelines that led to institutional progress emphasis on large scale accomplishment however tends to obscure the contributions of librarians who daily perform countless small and caring acts that summed together positively affect the lives of ordinary individuals
gay mens book clubs versus wisconsins public libraries political perceptions in the absence of dialogue	2010	because of an absence of dialogue a tense relationship appears to exist between wisconsins gay mens book discussion groups and their local public libraries public library directors express interest in accommodating these groups if approached but face budget restrictions and local communities that may oppose these gatherings gay mens book clubs prefer meeting in private homes and other openly gayâ€friendly environments largely because of the conservatism of cultural institutions in their collective memories this qualitative study argues that with consistent dialogues gay discussion groups can help public libraries achieve their missions of diversifying their patrons collections and services and that public libraries can assist gay communities with establishing themselves in the city or countys history by hosting visible public discussions of gay texts as markers of an entire communitys cultural heritage

what we talk about when we talk about free speech	2015	american law is unique among western nations in its protection of hate speech defined as speech against groups of people limits to any legal speech are viewed as potential encroachments on first amendment rights the profession of librarianship has formally embraced and defended a strict interpretation of the first amendment in the freedom to read statement and in court however individual librarians and scholars of law are not unanimous in defending hate speech this article offers a rhetorical analysis of the defense of hate speech in these fields in order to illustrate a paradox speech that intimidates is designed to silence others voices good speech does not necessarily offer an antidote to bad speech when bad speech is loud and spoken often the consequences of allowing all speech in public forums should be regularly evaluated so public spaces remain places where everyone is free to enter and be heard without fear

placing the library an argument for the phenomenological and constructivist approach to the human geography of the library	2008	place reminds us to tailor our professional work to the shifting concerns and indeed the shifting criteria of our shifting constituencies rather than to a placeless professional vision of what librarianship society and literacy should be every place maker must make do make sense and make place in an environment that is technologically heterogeneous and in which the potential for novelty as well as recurrence is a persistent feature the siege flag of place has been raised not only in librarianship but in many sectors in defense of the human and the parochial of tradition and local turf taking a phenomenological cue here we attempt to prune and redirect this problematic term we arrive at what we consider reasonable criteria of success for ourselves to what extent is our library in whatever professional sense we assign that word vitally connected to the discursive practices of the places from which it draws its mandate we contend that vitalizing a library in this respect requires us to step outside the sphere of our habitual familiarity and to explore other places how we go about doing this is a matter of methodology if a prior conception of place interferes with the absorption of ethnomethods it should be held in suspension bracketed at least until the practitioner can grasp the place that already exists

german libraries and scientific and technical information in nazi germany	1985	national socialist policies drastically altered the roles of germanys various scientific and technical library networks the ability of the libraries in these systems to supply the results of current research to their users depended greatly on their access to foreign publications nazi ideological objections to foreign research were articulated in a series of laws and decrees that effectively prevented publicly accessible general state and university libraries from supplying foreign journals to their clientele technological university libraries open to a smaller circle grew in importance during the reich both as collections and as agencies of dissemination to government and industry private industrial research libraries using their own funds as well as the services of foreign subsidiaries also flourished under the nazis and profited from the additional dissemination services provided by the technological universities the decline in general university libraries and the rise of industrial collections reflected the overall diversion of research under the nazis from universities to the laboratories and proving grounds of industry
on the use of the records of research	1979	how much of what kind of knowledge of prior research is needed and wanted by those conducting research can it only be acquired or is it best acquired by the use of the original reports of prior research situational familiarity is the kind of knowledge wanted historical familiarity with ancestral research is a conventional requirement differing in importance in different areas the comprehensive literature search often supposed to be a necessary preliminary to a new research effort is usually unnecessary in theory and often unnecessary in practice working familiarity with research areas from which potentially useful contributions are expected is sought in proportion to the expectation of impact of others work on ones own use of original research reports is not indispensable and is often an inferior means of acquiring the desired familiarity librarians and others exaggerate the need for bibliographic access to original research reports greater development of means of avoidance of use of such reports would be of more value to research than further development of bibliographical access

public opinion toward user fees in public libraries	1998	the issue of user fees in public libraries has been debated extensively in the library community in the last several years since their origins in the nineteenth century american public libraries have relied almost exclusively on public funding an examination of their nature as public goods however reveals public library services to be as much private goods as public goods this conclusion based on economic grounds is supported by surveys of public opinion toward user fees in libraries which have typically found the general public to be more tolerant of fees than librarians in this study we reanalyzed the data from a national telephone poll of 1181 us residents conducted in 1991 by the library research center at the university of illinois when asked what they would like to see done if their local public library were facing a fiscal crisis 47 percent of those voicing an opinion favored raising taxes while 44 percent favored instituting user fees the remaining 9 percent advocated a reduction in services we used the framework of discrete choice analysis to determine whether attitudes toward fees and taxes stem more from citizens own self interest or more from their political outlook we found greater support for self interest as an explanation in particular more frequent library use urban residence a higher level of education and greater income were all associated with a greater preference for taxes over fees or service cuts

comparison of the publishing patterns between men and women phds in librarianship	1988	previous research examining librarians publishing patterns has established the significance of published research for personal advancement studies have found however that in comparison with male librarians female librarians tend to publish in disproportionately small numbers one rationale offered for this discrepancy is that men receive the phd more frequently than do women doctorate holding librarians have been isolated as the most prolific writers this study tests the hypothesis that men and women exhibit similar publishing patterns if education is held constant at the doctoral level the population studied is limited to a random sample of library science phds who received their degrees between 1969 and 1979 a list of each persons publications was compiled for the five year period following receipt of the phd the citations are classified by gender occupation and type of publication and authorship on the basis of this study the hypothesis that men and women will exhibit similar publishing patterns cannot be rejected the difference in the number of citations per person for equal numbers of men and women is insignificant differences between men and women when comparing type of publication type of authorship or quality of articles are also insignificant there is however a significant difference between the number of unpublished women and the number of unpublished men almost three times more women than men have no citations listed in library literature the hypothesis can be rejected when comparing male and female educators the difference between mean number of citations per person as well as the difference between nonpublishing male and female educators is highly significant male educators publish almost twice as many works as do women female educators are almost six times as likely as male educators to have published nothing

the ethical presuppositions behind the library bill of rights	2000	the american library associations alas library bill of rights is based on a foundation of ethical presuppositions in this article these presuppositions are spelled out and critically examined in light of several ethical theories for example utilitarianism natural rights theory and social contract theory we suggest that social contract theory provides the strongest argument for a right to access to information and to have that information provided by public libraries we argue however that the right to access to information is not unlimited limiting access including censorship is appropriate for example when such a limitation is necessary to protect a more fundamental right finally we argue that the alas advocacy of an unlimited right to access is based on a mistaken understanding of what follows from the fact that all of our judgments are fallible
