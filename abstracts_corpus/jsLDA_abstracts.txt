A Service-Learning Framework to Support an MLIS Core Curriculum	2011	This paper identifies the core areas of the Master of Library and Information Studies (MLIS) curriculum at the School of Library and Information Studies (SLIS), University of Alabama, that informed student experiences during an ongoing service-learning project designed to provide basic technology literacy training to individuals with intellectual disabilities. This study was conducted to assess whether student participation complemented or expanded the knowledge and skills gained from the MLIS core through application in an external setting. The knowledge and skills acquired by the students are intended to raise consciousness of critical literacy issues that will enable students to participate in community engagement beyond their MLIS program. Through this study, the authors evaluate a project framework designed to connect student experiences in a training-based project with the core areas of the MLIS curriculum. Preliminary analysis demonstrates potential for the framework to serve as a practical generalization for developing similar basic technology literacy projects that can complement what is taught in other MLIS programs.
The Non-White Man's Burden in LIS Education	2019	Traditionally, American library and information science (LIS) education and librarianship have been predominantly white and female-oriented professions. As an international gay male person of color (originally from India) in its ranks, I have embraced social justice scholarship outside and within our bastion institutions of higher learning during a 14.5-year tenure as an LIS educator in the United States. This article reflects on select experiences as a minority along multiple intersectional dimensions of human experience and socially constructed identity markers, including race/ethnicity, national origins, sex, gender, and sexual orientation. Indulging in these musings allows me to decipher layers of complexities shaping faculty interpersonal microaggressions, a perceived lack of equal/equitable recognition of contributions, and limited comparable administrative growth/opportunities. These are discussed as hypothesized encounters in the form of few imagined scenarios or key episodes connected in the form of a searching narrative. It develops an alternative "voice" to identify possible directions that might transform LIS education beyond its "feel good" practices/policies surrounding diversity, inclusion, and collegiality and give it greater relevance in the twenty-first century. The goal is to engage authentic conversations that address behaviors of perceived prejudice, bias, abuse, and discrimination (intentional or unintentional) by LIS faculty/administrators targeting male faculty of color and "marginalized" others (e.g., first-generation graduates) in academic and professional networks.
A Decade of Doctorates: An Examination of Dissertations Written by African American Women in Library and Information Studies, 1993-2003	2007	This exploratory study examines the number of African American female doctoral recipients in library and information science (LIS) and their research interests in the past ten years. It enhances understanding of what African American female Ph.D. recipients plan to contribute to the LIS field through what they have found important to study in their dissertation research. These areas of study provide insight into the participation of African American women in LIS and the amount of research focus being given to information issues related to African Americans. This paper presents these data and findings within the context of diversity in doctoral education in LIS and historical issues of the participation of African Americans in LIS education. Recommendations and areas of future research generated from findings are proposed to further explore the implications of the findings discussed in this paper and to assist graduate school administrators in refining recruitment methods that will serve to attract more African American women to the LIS field.
Igniting Diversity	2015	The Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE) appointed a five-member Taskforce in 2011 to pursue the development of an ALISE Statement on Diversity. Two years later, the ALISE membership voted unanimously to adopt the statement. In an effort to move the statement from mere words on paper, the Taskforce provided actionable models and ideas in an â€œigniteâ€ session on diversity. In this collaborative piece, four members of the ignite diversity panel share their ideas, experiences, and methods for advancing diversity in the classroom and beyond. Professors Renate Chancellor, Clara Chu, Howard Rodriguez-Mori, and Loriene Roy provide ideas and real world examples that can be readily implemented in the classroom, in research, and at the institutional level. While the United States provides the context for these discussions, many of these methods and ideas are readily adaptable to countries across the globe.
Are We There Yet? Results of a Gap Analysis to Measure LIS Students' Prior Knowledge and Actual Learning of Cultural Competence Concepts	2011	This paper reports on the preliminary results from a pilot study conducted to examine library and information science (LIS) students' perceptions of their level of preparation for becoming culturally competent LIS professionals. Students participated in an electronic survey, which contained a Likert scale measuring three areas of cultural competence: self-awareness, education, and interaction. A gap analysis technique was employed to detect discrepancies between students' prior knowledge and actual learning relative to cultural competence. This article discusses student-reported gaps in knowledge for the section of the questionnaire on "Education." Students indicated that all of the concepts introduced in this section were important to learn but their level of knowledge gained varied from no or low levels to moderate levels of actual learning.
Gazing the Diversity Stance in North America	2016	This article is an exploration of ways in which LIS educators can consider culture, heritage, and identity as a framework for becoming participatory agents of their teaching practices in the LIS classroom. To support this framework, this discussion introduces the research methodology, practitioner inquiry, as a meaningful approach to studying pedagogical practice and identity in the LIS classroom as a means to LIS educators becoming more self-reflective and aware of the impacts of their own identity construction in their teaching. In this article I am affirming the case for a diversity stance within the North American LIS curriculum. I am also posing additional questions and challenges about LIS identity construction and professional practice as we teach and learn in the classroom.
Alternative Perspectives in Library and Information Science: Issues of Race	1996	Since the 1970s, most disciplines and schools of professional studies have developed their areas of curriculum, research, and theory construction by including race and ethnic studies. At the same time, library and information studies has lagged in providing a broader understanding of race and librarianship. Although attempts have been made to fill the racial-understanding gap, most of the work is characterized as exceptional/pioneer biography, with little attention given to broader social constructs of race and racism. This article explores how library and information science education falls short in contributing to the literature on race and racism. The current multicultural movement in library science is to be addressed.
Unpacking Library Posters: A Theoretical Approach	2001	This paper explores the semiotic aspects of poster graphics observed as furnishings in selected libraries. Specifically, the paper analyzes the poster series produced and marketed by the American Library Association (ALA) as advertisements to promote reading and library use and considers how the behavior exhibited in these commercial scenes creates a discourse and subject positions that may ultimately be disconfirming for some library users. The theoretical framework for the study draws on a constitutive view of communication, which acknowledges the construction of knowledge and identity in interaction within social situations. Within this framework, Foucault's theory of discursive formation makes it possible to understand poster graphics as discursive practice, while Scheff's theory of the social bond draws attention to the unforeseen consequences for both library users and library professionals of the world view created by such posters.
Planning LIS Doctoral Education Around a Focused Theme	2016	This report discusses the Overcoming Barriers to Information Access (B2A) program. This is a doctoral cohort program at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee funded by the Institute for Museum and Library Services. The program has focused on educating the next generation of doctoral graduates in library and information science with an emphasis on the theme of overcoming barriers to information access. Fellows were provided resources to support their educational activities, research and instructional experiences. In this paper the principal investigator for the program and the B2A Fellows reflect on the challenges and the rewards of their experiences in the program. Key findings that emerged include the importance of building community throughout the program and exposure to diverse perspectives. This initiative shows that although funding packages provide important resources to students, they do not buy extra time. The reflections in this paper provide insights into the doctoral student experience that can benefit other library and information science doctoral programs.
Impolite Hostilities and Vague Sympathies	2019	In this autoethnographic article I reflect on my experiences as a now-tenured faculty member of color, which have been punctuated by incivility, bullying, stress, and abuse. As part of reconciling several acute events, I came to a distinct realization of what I had been going through; I was able to name it, and I was able to articulate the strategies I had been using to cope and thrive. This reflective piece is not meant to minimize the experiences of non-minority faculty, but it is absolutely meant to highlight and emphasize the specific challenges of being faculty member of color in library and information science, and in the academy writ large.
Studying Online	2015	This paper presents a large scale study of online MLIS students (n = 910), who completed at least one online course and were enrolled in 36 of the 58 ALA-accredited MLIS programs in Canada and the United States. The results indicate that the typical student is female, White, lives in an urban setting, and is in her mid-30s. Online students were found to be quite diverse, with statistically significant differences in their preferences and satisfaction across five demographic variables: age (generational cohort), employment status, urban status, commute distance, and program modality. Three motivations emerged: accommodation, predisposition, and selectivity, which influenced the respondents to choose online learning. The prevalent issues online MLIS students experienced were a sense of isolation from peers and instructors, and a lack of professional development and networking opportunities with peers. The findings have implications for enhancing MLIS online education including marketing, course offerings, and student support services.
Physiological Access as a Social Justice Type in LIS Curricula	2012	This study reports the results of a survey of library and information science (LIS) deans and directors and a content analysis of LIS schools' curricula as it relates to issues of physiological access. A conceptual framework of social justice is applied to analyze curricular approaches to diversity. Results indicate that LIS curricula include both topics of physical impairment and socially classified populations as diversity issues. Analysis of course titles and brief course descriptions indicate that the type of diversity is not explicitly defined at this macro-analytical level. The researchers propose further development of the social justice framework to provide a lens for continued examination of diversity in LIS education on a micro-analytical level.
Are You my Mentor? Identifying Mentors and Their Roles in LIS Doctoral Education	2012	This study evaluates the assumption of whether or not one can equate mentoring and advising in doctoral education, with a focus on the field of Library and Information Science. Furthermore, this study examines the presence of multiple mentors in doctoral education and their interrelationships and roles. Findings from the study suggest that the advisor serves as the primary and dominant mentor in doctoral education, with dissertation committee members serving in a secondary, yet purposive, role. Evidence is provided that the acknowledged mentoring roles are more attuned to career, over psychosocial, mentoring. Doctoral student colleagues appeared to provide mentoring in the form of role modeling and idea sharing. The implications for doctoral education are discussed.
Mapping the Infoscape of LIS Courses for Intersections of Health-Gender and Health-Sexual Orientation Topics	2014	The article explores the information landscape (i.e., infoscape) of library and information science (LIS) courses for intersections of health-gender and health-sexual orientation topics, concerns, and issues. This research was considered important because health information support services essential in today's society must include marginalized gender and sexual orientation-related content that is deemed taboo in an all-pervasive patriarchal and heterosexist culture. Research methods involved a content analysis of bibliographic course descriptions available on the homepages of graduate programs in Canada and the United States that are accredited by the American Library Association. Syllabi for LIS courses on health information support services, gender, and sexual orientation were also studied. Findings map the existing infoscape surrounding the teaching of health information support services in LIS and identify future directions for inclusion of gender and sexual orientation topics in the LIS curriculum.
Recruiting and Retaining Students of Color in LIS Programs: Perspectives of Library and Information Professionals	2006	The study was conducted to identify effective strategies for recruiting and retaining students of color in library and information science (LIS). Using a Web-based survey, the study collected data from librarians of color, enrolled in, or graduated from, ALA-accredited LIS programs. Study findings help reassess the efforts that LIS programs made in recruiting and retaining students of color, and shed light on some key areas of focus and improvement for such efforts. Suggestions are made to develop strategies for diverse LIS community and programs.
Crossing the Globe	2018	Increasingly, Library and Information Science (LIS) programs are offering study-abroad opportunities for students to have broader global classroom experiences to gain knowledge and exposure and to think beyond the confines of geographic boundaries. While studyabroad courses have long been a part of undergraduate and graduate education in North America, few opportunities exist for students in LIS. This paper argues for their continued offering as well as for the creation of new study-abroad courses in LIS. The simple reason is that global study programs help students understand the interconnectedness and inter-dependence of the world (Smith, Hallam, & Ghosh, 2012). They expose students to other practices in the information professions and create opportunities for library science programs to tap into new markets for recruitment. They also foster critical thinking on a range of issues including, but not limited to, race, ethnicity, and gender. A study-abroad program will serve as a model for discussing these factors as well as pedagogy, strategies for student learning, and cross-classroom collaboration.
"I Have Two Legs, not Four"	2019	This article is a commentary documenting the author's shared experience on the ALISE MEHC panel in 2018, with interwoven narrative addressing LIS cultural competency practices and stance.
Changing Course: Collaborative Reflections of Teaching/Taking "Race, Gender, and Sexuality in the Information Professions"	2014	This article is an attempt to reflect on the institutional and disciplinary context of a course on "Race, Gender and Sexuality in the Information Professions'' from the perspective of instructors and students. It examines the effectiveness of a course like this as an intervention to the normative landscape of the Library and Information Science (LIS) field that often privileges White, male, middle-class, heterosexual, U.S.-based values and interests. In this article we provide a brief background for the re-establishment of this course, offer a literature review defining the normative landscape of LIS, and discuss the positive aspects and pitfalls of injecting this course into the curriculum as a "diversity" intervention. Finally, we offer recommendations for how to further make visible and shift the hegemonic landscape in LIS toward an inclusivity that actively deals with how race, gender, class, and sexuality deeply informs our profession.
Civility and Structural Precarity for Faculty of Color in LIS	2019	Previous studies have established particular patterns of inequity, micro, and macro-aggressions that affect faculty of color at U.S. universities. This article provides an autoethnographic perspective on the experiences of women of color in LIS. It focuses specifically on the ways that prioritizing comfort and civility over equity and justice can create structural precarity â€“ precarity that is built into academic systems of reward and punishment â€“ for female faculty of color. The article also gives brief suggestions for resolving this issue.
The Work Calls for Men	2016	The leaders of the library profession in the United States in the 19th century were white, middle-class, college-educated men. They attempted to construct librarianship in the United States as an equivalent profession to the other white, masculine professions of their day. They also created education for librarianship in the same mold. They subscribed to, and employed, the traditional white Western masculine definition of profession as one of expertise derived from education based on science. They also employed the control of knowledge and its application as exemplified by the type of professional education they promoted. Their efforts were not restricted to education but also included active discrimination against female librarians in the Library War Service during the First World War. This paper presents a new perspective on the meaning of â€œprofessionâ€ which recognizes it as situated at the intersection of gender, race, and nationality and explores the implications for modern education for librarianship.
The Danger of an Untold Story	2019	People of color who choose careers in higher education may encounter microaggressions, marginalization, and other unpleasant situations. This narrative shares the experiences and perspectives of one African-American academic's experiences with the intent of encouraging academic professionals from underrepresented populations to persevere.
Do You Really Want a Diverse Program?	2019	Despite multiple calls for diversifying academia in general, and Library and Information Science programs (LIS) specifically, the number of faculty of color working in higher education remains low. This work presents the points of view and suggestions of a faculty member concerning the diversity dilemma in LIS. The work relies on personal narratives in order to present the experiences and point of view of a member of the LIS community who constantly navigates the spaces of academia while negotiating the many aspects of their experience through the intersections of race, ethnicity, and gender. The main objective of the work is to present areas for consideration to those who are interested in bringing change and supporting faculty of color.
Racial Battle Fatigue	2019	African-American women faculty are told that contemporary educational and professional institutions, particularly at historically White institutions (HWIs), are places where they can succeed. However, in these institutions, many Black women faculty are exposed to racial and gender discrimination and are subjected to Racial Battle Fatigue. This article explores experiences of Black female faculty and describes the challenges they endure in higher education.
Diversity and LIS Education: Inclusion and the Age of Information	2011	While LIS continues to struggle with representation of populations traditionally considered as core to diversity, socio-economic and technological changes have significantly increased the range of populations that are disadvantaged underrepresented, and excluded in terms of information. Drawing from studies of diversity in LIS education and professions, as well as national demographic data, this article: (1 ) examines understandings of diversity within the field; (2) analyzes the implications of diversity in education, recruiting, and scholarship; and (3) explores models for inclusive diversity education. This paper argues that the field needs to embrace a broader, more inclusive understanding of diversity to remain culturally relevant.
Black Students in Predominantly White Library Schools	1987	This study sought to determine the nature of the educational experiences and social interactions of black students enrolled at predominantly white library schools from 1962 to 1974. A mail survey was conducted among one-half of the persons named in the 1984 membership directory of the Black Caucus of the American Library Association. From the 32.8% response, 19.2% was used in this analysis. Findings indicate that the majority of respondents were not treated as if they were below standard expectations; neither were their classroom contributions regarded as of less importance than those of other students. The majority also perceived an absence of discriminatory grading practices and required remedial work and felt that their experiences were typical. They did not feel themselves to be on display when it seemed to benefit the school; however, they felt that white students tended to be distant and unfriendly.
Stigmatizing Disability	2017	Libraries have historically organized materials about people with disabilities according to conventions created by medical and social scientific communities, thereby reproducing dominant, often pathologizing and marginalizing discourses about disabilities. This paper focuses on libraries' treatment of subjects related to physical disabilities by analyzing the National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headings, Library of Congress Subject Headings, the Library of Congress Classification, and the Dewey Decimal Classification. We use the lens of stigma as first theorized by Erving Goffman to reveal some of the processes and practices by which materials are relegated to the margins on the shelves and in the catalog.
A "Despised" "Semi-Profession": Perceptions of Curricular Content Relating to Gender and Social Issues among 1993 MLIS/MLS Graduates	1997	In the spring of 1994, the authors surveyed 793 male and female 1993 masters of library and information studies graduates, U. S. and Canadian, concerning social responsibilities and gender issues, and the treatment that these subjects received in their master'sdegree programs. Extensive personal data were also solicited, including the respondents' self-identified political orientation, sexual orientation, marital status, educational background, and job history. The response rate was 58 percent. Quantitative data and voluminous open-ended comments received suggest that librarians and library education are less progressive than commonly depicted in the professional press; that some programs do not even discuss women's issues in their courses; and that socially nonreactionary female graduates are eager to learn more about these and related issues, not only because it will benefit them personally, but also because the majority of library clients are female.
Student Conceptions of Group Work	2018	The use of collaborative pedagogies is a well-respected and common feature of higher education, and the ability to work well in a team is a desirable graduate and professional attribute. However, tutors can often experience significant issues with the support and management of student group work, and students can find group work difficult to manage and have very negative perceptions of group work. This paper examines LIS students' conceptions of group work as revealed through the students' drawings. Some 146 drawings of group work were collected from taught postgraduate and undergraduate students in an Information School. The drawings reveal a wide range of conceptions of group work, from very process- and tool-driven conceptions to more metaphorical conceptions of idea generation, puzzle, or a site of strength. Students were concerned with group structures and the role of leader. Group work is negatively affected by stress and perceptions of unequal contribution of group members. Implications are drawn for LIS educators, and suggestions are made for the use of drawing as a method of group support.
From the One-Mule Tenant Farmer to the Hillbilly Highway	2017	The following article presents an overview of the poverty and dispossession of the white working class in the twenty-first century. It explores the manner in which librarians' diminished connection to labor and denigration of Trump voters are combining to erode the library mission of service to all. It concludes with suggestions for reconnection and renewal.
We Will Not Be Silent	2017	This article focuses on the role of LIS faculty and researchers in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election. Key points include our responsibility to educate ourselves about marginalization and silencing; to help our students build theoretical, practical, and ethical foundations for engaging with communities in ways that prioritize their needs and uphold the values of the profession; to amplify the voices of people systematically targeted by the presidential administration's policies and actions; and to engage in public discourse about the implications of current administrative policies as related to the core values of LIS, such as the right to privacy, access, freedom of speech, and intellectual freedom. The article draws parallels between social oppression, as demonstrated in campaign rhetoric and presidential policy, and institutional oppression within library spaces.
Critical Literacy Performances in Online Literature Discussions	2016	In today's media-laden environment, the ability to read text from a critical literacy perspective is imperative, particularly for librarians who influence children's reading choices and behaviors. This study examines the critical literacy performances of students in an online, asynchronous, graduate-level children's literature course using a qualitative approach to content analysis. The findings indicate that students performed critical literacy in four ways: (1) they unpacked the social identities and norms evident in the books, (2) considered characters and events from multiple viewpoints, (3) interrogated issues of power, authority, and agency and (4) analyzed the historical, cultural, and sociopolitical contexts of the books. While the findings reveal critical literacy can be enacted in the context of online courses, students' critically literate thinking was sometimes limited and superficial, suggesting students' understanding of critical literacy could be deepened with additional instruction and scaffolding.
Behavior of Librarians in School and Public Libraries with Adolescents: Implications for Practice and LIS Education	1999	A study of service encounters between adult library staff and adolescent users drawing on the communication theories of Erving Goffman, Michael Lipsky, and Hartmut Mokros is reported from three data sources: a content analysis of professional guides to conduct, group interviews with adult library staff and adolescents, and taped observations of professional and clerical encounters in a high school library. Professional guides to practice are predominantly prescriptive, advocating the avoidance of behaviors admittedly prevalent in practice. Adults and adolescents are congruent on what they want out of ideal encounters, but admit to stereotypical views of the other based on age and appearance. Service is found to be multidimensional, primarily clustered in very short interactions when classes change, more predominantly concerned with help with equipment, and less than half of what staff do in the high school library. An equal amount of time is allocated to enforcement activities, none of which is alluded to in professional guides to conduct. Influences of technology on practice and rhetoric on reality are discussed.
Inside Board Books: Representations of People of Color	2010	Research suggests that exposure to books and other resources about people who look like them, and stories that reflect their world, may contribute to an infant and toddler of color's developing appreciation of self. The purpose of this study was to examine children's board books published between 2003 and 2008 to determine the representation of people of color. The findings were analyzed using the lenses of critical race theory and the typology developed by Rudine Sims Bishop to describe African American children's literature. The results indicated that, despite the increasing ethnic and racial diversity in the United States, board books that feature people of color are rare and often present inauthentic and monolithic representations. Even rarer seems to be the creation of board books by authors and illustrators of color. The authors conclude that the lack of board books featuring children of color denies these children an important resource for developing a positive selfâ€concept.
Small Business Perspectives on the Role of Rural Libraries in Economic Development	2017	People living in the Appalachian region, including its rural areas, face challenging economic, social, and cultural conditions with limited financial opportunities, information poverty and unemployment, and low levels of information literacy and educational attainment. The roles played by rural public libraries in small business economic development in this region require exploratory study of representative small businesses to refocus library services and resources on their information needs and information-seeking experiences. This article proposes a user- and use-based model to represent the information context and perspectives of such businesses in the state of Tennessee as a case study in order to apply the lessons and insights to other parts of the United States. It concludes with suggestions for the blueprint design of a public library small business tool kit, an ideal resource that Tennessee's rural public libraries can develop for small businesses in the future.
The Virtuous Circle Revisited: Injecting Diversity, Inclusion, Rights, Justice, and Equity into LIS from Education to Advocacy	2015	The field of library and information science (LIS) has long struggled with issues of diversity and inclusion in the composition of information professionals, in educational content, and in connecting with many communities. Yet the field has also produced many innovative approaches to meeting unique community needs and incorporating issues of justice, rights, and equity into educational activities. Although these approaches rarely connect education and advocacy, connecting these two can both facilitate better sharing of best practices in these areas and enable the educational and professional efforts of the field to better complement one another. Building on the â€œvirtuous circleâ€ concept that a truly effective focus on inclusion in the field will require involvement of both educators and professionals, this article offers a series of cases from LIS education programs and information institutions focusing on intersecting issues of diversity, inclusion, rights, justice, and equity.
Improving the Leadership Skills of Pre-Service School Librarians Through Leadership Pre-Assessment	2014	School librarian guidelines encourage active leadership in schools. Two ways school librarian educators can encourage school librarians to be leaders are to embed the standards into the certification curriculum and to assess the leadership potential of preservice school librarians in order to adapt the curriculum to their needs. This mixedmethod study examines how a pre-assessment of leadership potential was implemented in a school librarianship certification program that emphasized leadership skills. The results of the study indicate that the leadership pre-assessment implemented during the program application process effectively identified teacher leaders with the potential to be exceptional school librarians. This signifies that leadership pre-assessments can enable school librarian educators to help pre-service school librarians to improve their leadership skills.
Cultural Competence: A Conceptual Framework for Library and Information Science Professionals	2009	Today's twentyâ€firstâ€century library and information science (LIS) professionals are faced with the challenge of a growing population of individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds, many of whom are from minority and underserved populations representing the poorest segments of society with little or no experience with libraries. This article argues that although considerable efforts have been made by LIS professionals to meet the needs of minorities and underserved populations, a cultural competence framework is needed for these efforts to be successful. This article proposes a conceptual framework for developing cultural competence for LIS professionals and identifies three domains in which cultural competence is developed: cognitive, interpersonal, and environmental. The development of cultural competence within these domains is discussed, and essential elements needed to develop cultural competence within the domains are identified.
(Re)Positioning Librarians: How Young People View the Information Sector	2001	More than 2,000 students entering their first year of university studies completed questionnaires about the work roles, future employment prospects, educational requirements, status, and starting salaries of twelve occupations. Their responses were compared with U.S. and Canadian government labor-force projections. The results revealed a complex interplay of gender relations in the students' perceptions of the occupational world and their roles within it. The results also revealed an interesting positioning of the job title "librarian" relative to other fields. Unlike their assessment of the other occupations included in the study, the students considerably underestimated the level of education required to be a librarian (most did not believe that librarians require a university education). They also underestimated librarians' average starting salary and rated the occupation's social status and future prospects to be lower than the other job titles. Taken together, the results indicate that young people beginning their university studies hold views about career prospects in the information sector that are consistent with some laborforce analysts' views of occupational winners and losers. The students see status, opportunity, and success to be attainable in fields such as computer engineering and systems analysis. Unfortunately, they view the occupational present and future for librarians in a somewhat dimmer light, a worrisome result in view of labor-force data that suggest reasonably strong salary and employment opportunities for this occupation in both the United States and Canada. The implications of these findings for library and information science (LIS) education are discussed in the context of gender and identity politics.
The Place of Reference Service in Ranganathan's Theory of Librarianship	1976	S. R. Ranganathan approached librarianship theoretically. He sought to establish fundamental principles from which effective library practices could be systematically derived. Although he contended that he had discovered these principles, his "five laws of library science," through a rigorous scientific process, it is clear that they and the concept of librarianship based on them are more fundamentally the product of Ranganathan's Hindu tradition. Ethical and metaphysical premises characteristic of Hinduism are reflected in his conception of the social and cosmic purpose of the library and of reference service as the basic means of fulfilling that purpose. Ranganathan believed that effective reference service depended on the intuitive "flair" of the librarian and on the use of an analyticosynthetic classification scheme. While the dependence of his concept of reference service on intuition lessened its practical value for American librarians, both his discussion of analyticosynthetic classification and the broad perspective from which he speaks are potentially important contributions to the understanding and practice of reference service in American libraries.
What's Everybody Talking about?: Message Functions and Topics on Electronic Lists and Newsgroups in Information and Library Science	1997	The use of listserv software and Usenet newsgroups to support discussion among professionals in library and information science has become commonplace in the 1990s. The current research was conducted to find out which topics of discussion are dominant and which functions are performed by the messages posted to discussion groups in library and information science. In fall 1994, twenty-one students in an introductory course on communication processes completed analyses of fourteen different electronic lists or newsgroups as their term projects. Messages on each list or newsgroup were captured for approximately one month. Each message or partial message was described, in terms of its topic and its function, and frequencies were calculated. The topics most frequently discussed in each group were reasonably consistent with the group's stated purpose. In addition, technology topics were frequently discussed, as well as topics related to the library's clientele. The most common message functions were announcements, queries, and responses of various types. Comments made in the context of free-wheeling discussions also were common on some of the lists, but were rare on others. In addition to providing some baseline data on the topics and functions of messages in computer-mediated discussions, this study accomplished two pedagogical objectives: to introduce new students to electronic discussion groups as a channel for professional communication, and to introduce them to content analysis as a research method.
American Sculpture and the Library of Congress	2010	The Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress is one of the more significant public structures in American architecture, due for the most part to its wealth and quality of decoration, including an extensive sculptural program executed in 1894â€“97. The architects entrusted the program to a committee of three prominent sculptors, J. Q. A. Ward, O. L. Warner, and Augustus Saintâ€Gaudens. Nearly one hundred individual works were commissioned from thirty sculptors. In spirit they affirm the Enlightenment belief in public access to knowledge being essential to a democratic society and in style the tenets of the American Renaissance, an essentially conservative style that looked to antiquity and the Italian Renaissance to establish continuity with the traditions of the past.
Education for the Common Good	2018	This paper was produced as a collaborative project by a Progressive Librarianship class at an ALA-accredited Masters of Library and Information Science (MLIS) program located in Canada. Recent research in LIS has identified a need for issues of social justice to be discussed more prominently in LIS education. From a uniquely student perspective, the authors suggest how MLIS programs can incorporate social justice as a key component in LIS education. Specifically, they encourage pedagogy that supports critical thinking on issues of social justice and provides scaffolding for progressive change for the common good within a library context. This includes where social justice should appear in the LIS curriculum, who should teach about social justice, what topics are currently of relevance, and suggestions on key strategies for progressive change that can be taught in LIS education.
Preparing Future Librarians to Effectively Serve Their Communities	2013	AbstractThe field of library and information science (LIS) continues to struggle with the issue of diversity and inclusion. As we are perpetually working to increase racial and gender diversity in the profession, the definition of diversity continues to broaden to include socioeconomic status, education, language, literacy, age, sexual orientation, ability, geography, and much more. It is disheartening that the composition of our profession does not reflect the diverse patrons and communities that we serve. In preparing the next generation of librarians, LIS programs need to be able to groom culturally competent librarians who can serve these broadening communities. In this article, we urge LIS programs to develop the audacity and desire to experiment with their programs and saturate LIS education with elements of diversity and inclusion. We call for more dialogue in the form of symposia, panels, and discussions that will transform our LIS programs to be relevant to our communities.
Faculty and Student Perceptions of Distance Education Using Television	1987	This paper includes a description of the evolution of the distance education efforts of the University of South Carolina College of Library and Information Science, and the results of a study of the students who participated in those courses. Analysis of the data gathered indicated, among others, that there appear to be some differences in the various modes of instructional delivery in the perceptions of the students and faculty, but the benefits of distance education, especially using telecommunications technology, is a viable alternative for the delivery of library and information science education.
Professional Values and Ethics as Defined by "The LIS Discipline"	2003	The library and information science literature suggests a growing theoretical congruence in professional values and ethics. These values and ethics may be interpreted and applied in a variety of ways and through a variety of institutions. The library and information science (LIS) community has perhaps not been as responsive as it might be to these issues. LIS educators should first seek to identify the scope of the issues and then help students engage in what may become one of the more controversial domains of our time
The Politics of Standard Selection Guides: The Case of the "Public Library Catalog"	2003	Using the "Public Library Catalog (PLC)" as an example, we show how a well-respected collection development tool contains ideological frames. Graduate students at a library science program at a North American university were asked, as part of a class assignment, to evaluate PLC recommendations for subject areas in which they had background knowledge. The PLC often makes recommendations that have an imbalance of perspectives (for example, missing theoretical perspectives, overemphasis of a particular facet or theory within a field, missing voices), lack authority, do not have a close match between recommended title and topic area, do not provide a comprehensive framework for the subject area, and are problematic in terms of their usability (for example, lack of balance between scholarly and popular titles, datedness, and format).
Integrating Research Results and National Board Certification Standards into a Leadership Curriculum for School Library Media Specialists	2007	National guidelines and professional associations have recently focused on leadership as an essential action area for competent school library media specialists. Although for many years at the Florida State University College of Information leadership had been incorporated into the curriculum for school media specialists, faculty, prompted by a university-wide leadership initiative and feedback from the field, decided to examine possible ways to integrate an even stronger leadership component. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards tenets, which focus on encouraging organizational leadership, provided a natural foundation for curriculum development. Florida State University College of Information faculty systematically developed a based-on-research leadership curriculum (Project LEAD) using a variety of formal and informal data sources. This research both validated and improved course content. Research findings substantively influenced the curriculum design that will produce school library media specialist leaders.
Shifting Sands and the Prophet's Dream	2019	This paper explores four main areas that will likely have an impact upon the future of information organization education. In particular, information organization education must be prepared for the continued shift from the use of traditional library cataloging standards to more web-compliant, linked-data standards. Also, there will be more emphasis on the ethical impact of information organization work and the achievement of behavioral competencies of students interested in information organization. Finally, the paper addresses the need for educators to improve their teaching ability in order to more effectively impart the importance of information organization to all library and information science students.
Library and Information Science as a Social Science: Neutral and Normative Conceptions	1995	When library education was institutionalized at universities in the 1920s and 1930s in the United States, it pursued a social scientific path of disciplinary growth guided largely by perspectives in the philosophy of science. In this way, objectivity and neutrality became prominent professional ideals of library education. A different conception of social science denies a disinterested outlook and provides the basis for recent challenges to the profession's traditional perception of itself and its disciplinary growth. This article explores alternately the "neutral" and "normative" conceptions of library and information science as a social scientific discipline.
The Last Socially Acceptable Prejudice: Gay and Lesbian Issues, Social Responsibilities, and Coverage of These Topics in M.L.I.S./M.L.S. Programs	1996	A survey of 465 U.S. (90.5 percent) and Canadian (9.5 percent) 1993 graduates of master's (M.L.I.S. and M.L.S.) programs accredited by the American Library Association (ALA) addressed lesbigay issues within the context of professional social responsibilities. Specifically, graduates were asked to agree or disagree with thirty-three statements reflecting attitudes toward (1) the ALA position on social responsibility as manifested in official professional documents such as the ALA Library Bill of Rights; (2) multiculturalism and political correctness; (3) the status of women in librarianship; (4) gay and lesbian issues in librarianship; and (5) the treatment these topics received in their M.L.I.S. and M.L.S. programs. Extensive personal data were also solicited, including the subjects' self-identified political orientation, sexual orientation, personal acquaintance with AIDS victims, educational background, and job history. Responses and openended comments indicated that library and information studies and library and information professionals are not ideologically cohesive in their views on women's issues, lesbigays, or the relationship between social responsibilities and professionalism. The findings of the study, although not definitive, would seem to justify more exhaustive studies on the demographic and ideological identity of library and information professionals.
Unequal Legacies: Race and Multiculturalism in the LIS Curriculum	2006	Race remains poorly understood and inadequately represented in library and information science (LIS) education. Educators tend to avoid the term â€œrace,â€ preferring the more inclusive â€œmulticulturalism.â€ Yet these terms are far from equivalent: the various dimensions of multiculturalism, including race, ethnicity, class, and gender, have different histories and different theoretical explanations. Four models dominate LIS research and teaching: science/technology, business/management, mission/service, and society/culture. Each has left its own racialized legacy, invisibly influencing the field's current concepts of race. Drawing on recent research into â€œwhitenessâ€ and racial formation, I show that although each model transmits an inheritance that perpetuates white privilege, each also carries the potential for positive transformation. Arguing that courses in all four areas have the capability to foreground race, the article outlines ways in which faculty, students, and library practitioners together can make curricular changes that contribute to the creation of libraries as â€œnonwhiteâ€ or â€œraceâ€neutralâ€ spaces.
In Search of Multiculturalism in the Library Science Curriculum	1995	This article discusses the need for multiculturalism to be an integral part of the library science curriculum and relates the results of a survey of library schools on the issue of multiculturalism and curriculum modification/revision. The authors conclude that the issue has received increased attention and positive action, but that a certain tension exists. They also found that the least activity in modification/revision concerning multiculturalism has taken place, curiously, in academic librarianship courses. The authors support extended efforts of library schools to prepare librarians for work in an increasingly diverse society and library environment.
Promoting Reflexivity and Inclusivity in Archival Education, Research, and Practice	2010	The area of archival studies today transcends the professional field of archival science. It encompasses an everâ€broadening array of disciplinary discussions and methodological approaches that are identifying, critiquing, and addressing the shifting social, cultural, philosophical, and political, as well as the technological, imperatives of record keeping and remembering in the twentyâ€first century. Reporting on two recent research projects and three ongoing educational initiatives, this article suggests ways in which research and education in archival studies can play a central role in promoting more reflexive and inclusive ideas, practices, and research, not only within the archival profession, but also within the various library and information science (LIS) and iSchool settings in which archival education and research might be situated.
Censorship and Children's Literature	1983	The present arguments over censorship of books for the young reveal, among other things, the conflicts in current social attitudes toward childhood and children. This essay attempts to place such arguments in some historical perspective. It suggests that the relative peace that prevailed in the field of children's literature from, roughly, 1900 to 1965 was the result of a broad consensus within the field about the needs of childhood and the function of literature for children. That consensus was, in turn, the result of the general homogeneity of the people involved in the production and purchase of books for children. Agreement broke up in the mid-1960s, when groups heretofore unconcerned with children's books began to see their social and political implications. Enormous changes in the content of children's literature followed with some paradoxical shifts in liberal-conservative positions on censorship. The 1980s promises to be a period of conflict, as conservative reaction against the liberal trends of the 1970s tries to reverse an accomplished transformation in the literature.
Visualizing Identities in LIS Literature	2018	This paper is based on statistical and qualitative analysis of library and information science (LIS) literature. Our study asks the question of whether, and if so, how, and how often, the discourse generated by scholarly literature in LIS engages discussion about identity in LIS, what topics are covered, and whether the articles engage praxis, or the application of theory to practice. Through searches in LISTA database that cross-referenced identity terms (e.g., Gender, LGBT) with terms describing prominent areas in the LIS field, we collected quantitative data and analyzed the co-occurrence of keywords and created network visualizations. We used a qualitative coding scheme to rate abstracts in terms of their relevance and actionability. Both modes of analysis show that generalized conversations about identity are most common, and praxis is rarely achieved. Using critical approaches to LIS, we explore the ramifications of silences within LIS literature upon the pedagogical and professional discourse.
Supporting First Year E-Learners in Courses for the Information Professions	2006	A considerable amount of research has been done into students' first year experiences at university: their transition from school to university and their social needs and experiences. The work described in the literature has concentrated on students who attend on campus. If on-campus students are experiencing problems with feeling isolated, a lack of identity and feeling part of a community, then how do online students deal with these same issues? A research project conducted at Edith Cowan University in 2004-2005 sought to discover the issues affecting first year students and the problems they experienced when beginning studies in online professional education programs for librarians, library technicians, teacher librarians, archivists and records managers. An anonymous web survey and feedback from students were used to find out how the online environment differs from the on-campus experience, to examine students' emotional response to studying online and to facilitate a more supportive experience at university. This paper reports the results of online students' first year experiences and the use of discussion forums to create an online learning community.
The Library in the Lives of Latino College Students	2006	Libraries share a perception of embracing and providing for all users. However, they also share a common philosophical stance shaped by librarians' individual discursive formations and the dominant cultural hegemony that values some users over others. Latinos constitute one of the fastestâ€growing, nondominant populations in the United States, and the literature suggests that libraries do not always serve them adequately. This was reinforced by interviews with seven Latino undergraduate students that suggest ambiguous feelings toward libraries and a strong need for some sort of cultural reinforcement. This study of users' perceptions of libraries may help librarians and policy makers consider more pluralistic approaches to library services.
Be Slow, Skeptical, and Classify	2019	This paper argues that medium for information access becomes central to library and information science. The author discusses the notion of medium, medium neutrality, and personalization and suggests that the dominating paradigm of providing fast, efficient, and neutral systems and services for retrieving information has sidetracked opportunities to explore the impact of medium on information access. The paper makes three specific recommendations for library and information science education: be skeptical, slow down, and understand classification.
Information Access and Exchange among Small Worlds in a Democratic Society: The Role of Policy in Shaping Information Behavior in the Postâ€9/11 United States	2005	Every democratic society relies on deliberation and dialogue between social groups with varying perspectives to provide for the representation of the diverse members of the society. Meaningful deliberation is based on open access to information by individuals and free exchange of information between different social groups. Policy developments in the United States since September 2001, however, have altered the roles of information in many social contexts, with impacts on information access and information exchange between social groups. These changes have the potential to be of great consequence to social and political uses of information in society. Libraries, as established guardians of diverse perspectives of information, are in a unique position to protect and preserve information access and exchange in this new policy environment.
If Diversity Is a Natural State, Why Don't Our Libraries Mirror the Populations They Serve?	2015	AbstractSynonyms for diversity include assortment, difference, distinctiveness, medley, unlikeness, and variety. Note that not one of these terms includes the concept of quotas or force of any kind. Diversity is the natural state. Sameness and uniformity are unnatural. Diversity is not about color, gender, age, language, or sexual orientationâ€”it is about all of these things. If we do not ensure that our libraries have frontline professionals who reflect the nature of the communities with which they work, then we will lose valuable patrons. They will turn instead to their neighbor who looks just like them, regardless of whether or not they receive valid information from that person. Encouraging diversity and looking at things differently are some of the most important things libraries do as educational institutions. This article explores ways to ensure that in the future our library and information professionals mirror the people they serve.
Negotiating Borders	2017	Recent developments in Canada, the United States, and beyond continue to test librarians' resolve and to redefine how we view ourselves and engage with communities. Drawing on examples from both Canada and the United States and deploying the concept of â€œborderâ€ as an analytical trope, we seek to probe and unsettle the geographic, professional, and ideological interfaces that librarians constantly negotiate. In a world where data know no borders but indigenous and other bodies are constrained by them, how do we respond to the â€œCalls to Actionâ€ of Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, to the violent displacement of millions of Syrians, to the resurgence of divisive politics and racist rhetorics, or to the surrender to data? Using the Trump election as a launching point, we explore key drivers for change in LIS in instances when politics spill into our professional purview.
Multicultural Young Adult Literature as a Form of Counter-Storytelling	2013	Counter-storytelling is defined by critical race theory scholars as a method of telling the stories of those people whose experiences are not often told, including people of color, the poor, and members of the LGBTQ community. This article discusses multicultural young adult literature as a form of counter-storytelling, with an emphasis on how counter-stories challenge the stereotypes often held by the dominant culture, give voice to marginalized youth, and present the complexity of racial and ethnic identify formation.
Camp Read-a-Rama® and Fully-Engaged Literacy Learning	2016	Literacy and literacy skill development remain critical concerns in the U.S. “Two of every three students in the U.S. do not have the necessary reading proficiencies to successfully complete grade-level work” (Allington, 2011). Camp Read-a-Rama, a summer day camp in South Carolina for 4- to 11-year-olds, creates innovative programming using children’s literature as the springboard for all camp activities. Activities connect with and reinforce concepts in children’s literature, thereby helping children learn to “live books” and understand connections between their reading and their lives. For six summers (2009–2014), Camp Read-a-Rama has provided fully-engaged, week-long themed literacy immersion experiences that seek to turn “summer slide” into “summer stride.” The purposes of this longitudinal, mixed methods study were: (1) to ascertain the impact of Camp Read-a-Rama’s interventions on helping children develop positive attitudes toward reading; and (2) to determine best practices for literacy skill programming with children in libraries and the communities libraries serve. Findings offer compelling evidence that strategies employed through Camp Read-a-Rama programming positively impacted children’s attitudes toward reading and their interactions with books, a critical step in literacy skill development and improvement. Analysis of parent/guardian evaluations revealed the following emerging themes as perceived impacts of Camp Read-a-Rama programming upon campers: increased love and enthusiasm for reading, improved reading and listening skills, and a belief that camp activities create a deeper understanding of books and vice versa. Findings suggest that integrating literacy skill instruction and programming into LIS curricula could better prepare librarians and LIS professionals to have a greater impact on literacy skill development among the children they serve.
Creating Space at the Table	2017	Many of the most challenged books, year after year, feature voices from diverse communities (including those of women, racial or ethnic minorities, and LGBT people). Intellectual freedom protects these voices and protects our right to hear these voices. This essay discusses the definition of intellectual freedom, why diverse perspectives are important, and how intellectual freedom can bolster diverse voices. In turn, this can improve our relationships with one another, increasing empathy and respect, which can be reflected in numerous ways and is particularly important in a divisive political climate.
Information Literacy: A Contradictory Coupling	2003	Information literacy has established itself as an important subfield of librarianship. Yet although librarians justify information literacy as increasing democratic participation by all citizens, their efforts to improve "quality control" of information also threaten to restrict choice in systematic ways. This contradiction results in part from the genealogy of the terms "information" and "literacy," terms that share a relationship traceable to an Enlightenment ideology, namely, that reading could transform society by informing its people. But reading's power to transform was also a contested issue for groups seeking political and cultural ascendancy, and reading genres that initially challenged conventional thought evolved into those that buttressed it. In the process, some groups came to be defined as information "consumers" and simultaneously excluded from the role of information "producers." Strategies that can raise awareness of the assumptions underlying this legacy include critical analysis of language use and envisioning information use as a process that involves all users in both consumption and production. Adopting these can help librarians recognize that the tensions inherent in the discourse and practice of information literacy are not only unavoidable, but essential, if the basic condition of democracy--citizen participation--is to be fulfilled.
Library School Faculty Doctorates: A Statistical Review	1982	This study was undertaken to determine whether or not there was an over-all discernible trend either downward or upward in the percentage of earned doctorates held by the faculties of the accredited library school programs during the period from 1960 to 1978. The over-all percentage of faculty members with doctorates increased from 32.1 percent in 1960 to 65.9 percent in 1978. The largest over-all gain was made at the assistant professor level. Although women have made a more spectacular gain in the percentage of doctorates held than men, men throughout the period have held a larger percentage of doctorates than women. Women in 1960 filled a majority of the positions in the accredited schools. Men constituted a majority in the 1978-79 academic year. The Ph.D., first with a major in library science and then followed by majors in other disciplines â€” most frequently the humanities or educationâ€”is the most common type of doctoral degree held by library school teachers. Eight schoolsâ€”located in the Great Lakes region and the east â€” are primarily responsible for granting the library science doctorate to library school faculties.
Expanding LIS Education in the US Department of State's Diplomacy Lab Program	2018	This article focuses on two collaborative projects selected by the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy at the University of Tennessee to partner in the US Department of State's Diplomacy Lab program that engages college students and faculty to study foreign policy challenges. The projects allowed information science graduate students to learn applied research in the process of developing geographic information systems for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex advocacy. The paper identifies opportunities, challenges, and best practices in content delivery, resource development, and extended relationship-building while drawing upon teaching-research-advocacy intersections in library and information science education.
Teaching to Dismantle White Supremacy in Archives	2017	This article reflects on an exercise I developed to enable students to identify the ways in which white privilege is embedded in archival institutions and to collectively strategize concrete steps to dismantle white supremacy in their own archival practice. It argues that, in the face of disastrous political eventsâ€”such as the election of an explicitly racist protofascist as US presidentâ€”LIS faculty must intervene pedagogically to meet the needs of their most vulnerable students and to model behaviors of critique and resistance if we aim to train students who will disrupt the status quo of oppression as LIS professionals. The article includes printable graphics designed by Gracen Brilmyer and generated by the class exercise to serve as a visual reminder of our obligation to dismantle white supremacy in archival studies and archives more broadly.
Bibliographic Instruction and Mass Media News Literacy: A Theoretical Background	1998	This article suggests that bibliographic instruction (BI) librarians consider integrating a mass media news literacy and awareness component into their teaching duties. As the concentration of media power in the hands of a small number of corporate entities increases and as market-driven management imperatives dominate publishing practices, students should possess the skills to evaluate effectively and critically mass media sources such as main-stream newspapers and magazines. To this end, a theoretical framework for understanding mass media news influence is offered. The concepts of agenda setting, priming, framing, asymmetrical selection, binary oppositionalism, and institutional hegemony are explored in a survey of relevant literature from the fields of journalism and communications. A teaching strategy incorporating these concepts is sketched out. The strategy highlights one news event, and compares how different news sources report that event. Through such an exercise, students will be able to recognize how different news frames affect understanding of the topic in question. Ultimately, the successful BI program will be defined by the extent to which students move away from a passive reading of news media sources to a position where they are able to decode the social context of mainstream news production and develop informed and negotiated reading practices.
Books on the Frontier: The Extent and Nature of Book Ownership in Southern Indiana, 1800-1850	1972	The quality of the cultural life of the American frontier has long been in dispute. Some historians argue that the frontier forced the pioneers to revert to a near barbaric stage while it divested them of all aspects of their former cultures. Others maintain with equal vigor that the society which developed on each frontier was very nearly a carbon copy of the settled areas further east, and that the culture of Americans had not been significantly altered by the frontier process. Most agree, however, that evidence testifying to the nature and extent of book ownership provides one means of measuring the progress of culture on the frontier. This paper summarizes the results of an intensive study of this topic on the southern Indiana frontier. Data were collected from a variety of sources, but especially important were county probate records, which often contained inventories indicating books owned by early Indiana residents. An examination of over 2,000 inventories located in sixteen southern Indiana counties produced descriptions of more than 500 private libraries. An analysis of these libraries shows that the pattern of book ownership was not startingly different from that revealed by similar studies of book ownership in the American colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Clearly, books were not impossible to acquire in early Indiana, and a sizable proportion of the estates inventoried in the counties studied contained books. Most of the collections were small and narrowly religious in nature, with larger libraries still tending toward the utilitarian. However, a small number of inventories were discovered which listed large numbers of books; a few men--those with both the means and the inclination--built large and well-balanced libraries on the Indiana frontier.
Diversity in LIS Education Resources	2017	In light of events in several countries that were instigated by values that are contrary to those held by the Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE), the ALISE Board of Directors reaffirms its commitment to, and promotion of, diversity, equality and inclusion in the library and information science (LIS) education and professional community, and condemns racism, hate, bigotry, and violence. Diversity and inclusion are core elements of the LIS curriculum. To help LIS instructors teach and promote diversity, equality, and inclusion in their curriculum, we have compiled a list of recent works. This list is intended to serve as a living document. We encourage LIS educators, professionals, and students to use these resources in relevant learning settings to further promote these values within the communities we serve. (August 24, 2017)
Deans Rank Indicators of Effectiveness for Schools of Library and Information Studies	1996	This article identifies indicators of effectiveness that deans of schools with American Library Association (ALA) accredited programs believe are "essential," "important," or "not important" to know about a school of library and information studies (LIS) in order to evaluate it. A previous article by the same authors focused on views that members of four constituent groups of LIS schools hold about the same indicators.Â¹ Comparing deans with the constituent groups, there is 77 percent agreement between deans and members of ALA's Committee on Accreditation (COA) over which indicators of effectiveness belong in each of the three designated categories. There is less agreement between deans and senior academic administrators (70 percent), alumni (57 percent), and employers (44 percent). Overall, deans focus heavily on administrative, faculty, and resource issues.
The Advantages of Diversity	2013	AbstractIn college, I was surprised by the excitement of those in the student union who were hovering over the headlines in the local newspaper: â€œRussia Launches the First Satellite â€¦â€˜Sputnik.'â€ Russia had won the â€œrace to space.â€ How could Russia, where the majority of the population had only learned to read and write in the last fifty years, outdo the United States? Here's how: in 1945 the Allies allocated Berlin to Russia. Russia seized German scientists and Jewish intellectuals in countries from the Baltic to the Adriatic, thus acquiring a new talent pool of the brightest minds in Europe. Its edge over the United States in the â€œspace raceâ€ succeeded because of a diverse talent pool of harnessed diversity. This caused US leaders to evaluate their own scientists. The United States realized that the only way to win the â€œspace raceâ€ was to expand the educational system to include all races and cultures.
Evaluating Cultural Authenticity in Multicultural Picture Books: A Collaborative Analysis for Diversity Education	2014	AbstractThis study examines cultural authenticity reflected in multicultural picture books. Specifically, this study attempts to reframe issues surrounding the topic of cultural authenticity based on a systematic and empirical analysis of picture books that represent three different ethnic groups: African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanic Americans. A total of forty-five systematically selected picture books that represent fifteen books per ethnic group were selected and evaluated by multiple reviewers who were insiders of the culture. A coding scheme was developed to evaluate each book in terms of profile of major and minor characters, settings of the story, stereotypical features, and cultural authenticity. An in-depth evaluation of all selected books was added by a team of three reviewers in order to validate the results of the coded analysis. This study aims to shed light on library youth services and diversity education in a society with increasing ethnic diversity.
Early Literacy in Library Storytimes	2016	Across the nation, librarians work with caregivers and children to encourage engagement in their early literacy programs. However, these early literacy programs that libraries provide have been left mostly undocumented by research, especially through quantitative methods. Valuable Initiatives in Early Learning that Work Successfully (VIEWS2) was designed to test new ways to measure the effectiveness of these early literacy programs for young children (birth to kindergarten), leveraging a mixed methods, quasi-experimental design. Using two innovative tools, researchers collected data at 120 public library storytimes in the first year of research, observing approximately 1,440 children ranging from birth to 60 months of age. Analysis of year-one data showed a correlation between the early literacy content of the storytime program and children's outcomes in terms of early literacy behaviors. These findings demonstrate that young children who attend public library storytimes are responding to the early literacy content in the storytime programs.
The Portrayal of Librarians in Obituaries at the End of the Twentieth Century	2004	Obituaries can reveal much about the way a profession is conceived and structured in the popular imagination. This article examines obituaries of librarians in the New York Times between 1977 and 2002 to determine how librarians were presented to the general public by a major newspaper. Although librarianship is a femaleâ€intensive profession, 63.4 percent of the obituaries chronicled the lives of male librarians. Although public and school librarians outnumber their academic counterparts, obituaries focused on academic librarians. Far from creating a stereotypical portrait of librarians as shy, dour, dowdy, and sheltered individuals, the emphasis on largeâ€scale achievements in the obituaries produces an image of librarianship as a glamorous profession. Some librarians are presented as sleuths and detectives who amassed large collections. They contributed to the progress of scholarly research with extensive publications. Many others had connections to prominent people, making the most of these social networks in their work. Librarians were also players on the global stage, founding libraries abroad and developing international guidelines that led to institutional progress. Emphasis on largeâ€scale accomplishment, however, tends to obscure the contributions of librarians who daily perform countless small and caring acts that, summed together, positively affect the lives of ordinary individuals.
Gay Men's Book Clubs versus Wisconsin's Public Libraries: Political Perceptions in the Absence of Dialogue	2010	Because of an absence of dialogue, a tense relationship appears to exist between Wisconsin's gay men's book discussion groups and their local public libraries. Public library directors express interest in accommodating these groups if approached but face budget restrictions and local communities that may oppose these gatherings; gay men's book clubs prefer meeting in private homes and other openly gayâ€friendly environments largely because of the conservatism of cultural institutions in their collective memories. This qualitative study argues that, with consistent dialogues, gay discussion groups can help public libraries achieve their missions of diversifying their patrons, collections, and services, and that public libraries can assist gay communities with establishing themselves in the city or county's history by hosting visible public discussions of gay texts as markers of an entire community's cultural heritage.
A Neighborhood Analysis of Public Library Use in New York City	2005	The use of 200 public libraries in New York City was analyzed according to their neighborhood characteristics. In addition to demographic, economic, and cultural factors traditionally considered, the social and spatial interactions within a neighborhood were related to public library use. Correlation and regression analyses were implemented for all the libraries. The research found that traditional factors are not enough to explain public library use, especially in a cosmopolitan area such as New York City. Social connections and racial diversity and integration stimulate public library use. Based on these findings, suggestions were made for improving the underutilized library branches in disadvantaged neighborhoods.
A Comparison of Online and Face-to-Face Cohorts in a School Library Media Specialist Graduate Program: A Preliminary Study	2006	School Library Media Specialist training via distance education is of interest to the library community which is seeking to stem the shortage of school library personnel. However, the effectiveness of distance education compared to face-to-face delivery has not been thoroughly evaluated. This study compares one graduate-level School Library Media Specialist program delivered both through online and face-to-face instructional delivery methods. We found that, for the most part, the two student cohorts (distance and face-to-face) performed equally in the areas demonstrating content knowledge. However, the online cohort earned fewer points than the face-to-face cohort on some project activities demonstrating the difficulty in relating the intricacies of project work via an online course. This study suggests that the delivery of School Library Media Specialist training can be conducted through an online format if attention is paid to communicating the details of project based work.
Problems and Possibilities: The Public Library in the Borderline between Modernity and Late Modernity	2007	The public library is a product of modernity that follows in the wake of industrialization, urbanization, and popular movements, while at the same time the public library itself supports the building up and development of the modern. This article will examine the arrival of modernity and the prerequisites for the rise of public libraries, as well as some crucial aspects of the relationship between the public library and modernity. Furthermore, by means of contributions from recent significant sociologists, such as Anthony Giddens, Jean‐François Lyotard, and Scott Lash, we shall discuss the implications of the development of late modern or postmodern society for the present public library.
Accessibility and Diversity in Library and Information Science	2016	We incorporate the perspective of diversity in order to discuss accessibility problems in LIS. â€œDiversityâ€ is defined as the ability to create and ensure inclusive information access and services for different user groups. We outline the results of our study on library website accessibility for screen-reader users. Based on our findings, we argue that the inaccessibility of library websites is primarily a problem of diversity rather than being merely a technical issue. The high-level implications of this problem indicate the need to adopt inclusive principles that require usability beyond accessibility for all user groups in library web design. To meet this goal, we propose an inclusive information architecture specifically focused on screen-reader access. Our intention is to present broader guidelines for information design by illustrating one way in which inclusive principles can be applied to library website design by expanding and customizing the information architecture to meet the individual needs of diverse user groups.
What We Talk about When We Talk about Free Speech	2015	AbstractAmerican law is unique among Western nations in its protection of hate speech (defined as speech against groups of people). Limits to any legal speech are viewed as potential encroachments on First Amendment rights. The profession of librarianship has formally embraced and defended a strict interpretation of the First Amendment in The Freedom to Read Statement and in court. However, individual librarians and scholars of law are not unanimous in defending hate speech. This article offers a rhetorical analysis of the defense of hate speech in these fields in order to illustrate a paradox: speech that intimidates is designed to silence others' voices. Good speech does not necessarily offer an antidote to bad speech when bad speech is loud and spoken often. The consequences of allowing all speech in public forums should be regularly evaluated so public spaces remain places where everyone is free to enter and be heard without fear.
Critical Directions for Archival Approaches to Social Justice	2016	This article explores the rich history of social justice as a concern in archival studies and delineates future lines of inquiry for the field. We begin by examining how social justice has been defined in the archives literature and its implications for archival studies. Next, we draw forth five major strands of archival thinking in relation to social justice. We identify prominent areas in the archival literature that highlight the relationship between archives and social justice. We also identify critical questions in the relationship between social justice and archives and propose new research trajectories that we deem necessary to advance the archival field in general and its scholarship in particular. Finally, we argue for the importance of research that strengthens the tenets of social justice as a central principle in archival scholarship and practice.
From Queer to Gay and Back Again: Young Adult Novels with Gay/Lesbian/Queer Content, 1969-1997	1998	Approximately one hundred young adult novels with gay/lesbian/queer content have been published since the first one appeared in 1969. Building on earlier content analysis research, this article provides three theoretical approaches to understand the evolution of this subgenre, drawing on the work of Gerda Lerner, Rudine Sims Bishop, and George Chauncey. It concludes by highlighting themes and patterns that suggest the progress that has been made and has yet to be made in the realistic portrayal of gay/lesbian/queer lives in young adult fiction.
Service-Learning and LIS Education	2003	Service-learning, which engages students and universities in community building, has strong potential for advancing library and information science (LIS) education. Advantages include increased student learning, extended collaboration, decreased isolation, and promotion of the common good. Examples of service learning projects in LIS education offer models for imitation. Fieldwork offers opportunities for integrating service learning into the curriculum. LIS professors engaged in teaching which qualifies as service-learning should forge alliances with others involved in service-learning on their own and other campuses.
Contested Terrain: Accreditation and the Future of the Profession of Librarianship	2006	This article explores the future trajectory of librarianship and its status as a profession in the context of the contested terrain of the information professions and particularly the development of a differentiated information technology workforce. Andrew Abbott's theory of the system of professions informs the historical comparison and future forecasting of the relative power of librarianship and the emerging information technology professions to persist into the twentyâ€first century. How might value differences manifest themselves in the development of a legitimatizing process for information technology education? What effect might these have on the future development of information technology degree programs offered within schools of information studies? Is it likely that the stability that ALA has enjoyed as a mediator between librarianship and the discipline of information studies will be challenged? Finally, what are the likely consequences for the status of the profession of librarianship?
Preparing the Next Generation of Librarians for Family and Community Engagement	2018	Many librarians work in public libraries to make a difference for children, families, and communities and identify family and community engagement as a cornerstone of their responsibilities. For librarians to be successful they must be afforded strong foundations in family and community engagement that begin early in their preparation. Yet little is known about the knowledge, skills, and dispositions that librarians need to engage families and communities, and these topics are rarely covered in schools of information and library sciences. The purposes of this exploratory paper are to identify the competencies that librarians need to engage families and communities and to understand promising pedagogical methods for promoting them. Interviews were conducted with 11 library educators at leading schools of information and library sciences within the United States to understand their perspectives on the topics. Results reveal three main goals for the preparation of librarians for family and community engagement: (1) to provide librarians with knowledge of families and communities, (2) to promote relationship-building skills, and (3) to encourage the mindset that librarians are professionals. Experiential and connected learning opportunities are the most promising methods for achieving these outcomes. Findings are discussed in terms of four main recommendations for stronger integration of family and community engagement into existing curriculum.
Services to Older Adults: Preliminary Findings from Three Maryland Public Libraries	2009	This article reports preliminary findings of an evaluation of the services to older adults at three public libraries in Maryland. Data were collected in spring 2007 through interviews with nine library administrators and staff, and surveys with twenty-six older adult patrons at the three libraries. Approximately eight hours of observation were also conducted to gather contextual data to supplement the interview and survey data. The seven guidelines laid out by the American Library Association (1999) were used to guide the design of data collection instruments and the analysis of data. One key finding is that these libraries offer few programs and services geared to healthy and active older adults, thus leaving much room for improvement in the future. Interestingly, the libraries still received high praise from the older adult participants, a phenomenon that requires further examination. A number of recommendations are offered to help public libraries to better serve the aging population in their communities.
The More Things Change, the More They Stay the Same	2018	Discussions of diversity in American librarianship usually focus on gender or ethnicity, but historical studies also show a lack of diversity in educational and disciplinary backgrounds. Librarians traditionally hail from the humanities, especially English and history. But as current educational attention shifts to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, are librarians reflecting this change? Anonymized data from ALA-accredited graduate programs from the last five years were collected, coded, and classified to determine librarians' educational and disciplinary backgrounds and in what ways, if any, they differ from the past 65 years and from the contemporary US general population. Unsurprisingly, we found that contemporary librarians still hail predominantly from English and historyâ€”a stark contrast from the business and health undergraduate degrees earned by the general US population. Backgrounds in STEM fields remain lacking in librarianship, but librarians with undergraduate education in the arts are on the rise, perhaps supporting the creativity, flexibility, innovation, and risk taking necessary in twenty-first-century libraries.
Diversity by Design	2017	In this article, we introduce the concept of diversity by design. This concept is relevant to library and information science (LIS) education, professional environments, and partnership-based community engagements. Building on our experience as educators and researchers, we illustrate this concept in the context of LIS graduate education and invite readers to contemplate whether this concept makes sense to them and, if yes, how it works in their respective workplaces and communities. We interrogate the term â€œdiversity,â€ bringing to light the multiplicity of contexts that give diversity meaning and life in our complex field. By so doing, we demonstrate that diversity, broadly conceived, is foundational to LIS and that discounting or underappreciating its pivotal function may have a disintegrating effect on our practice, scholarship, and education.
Literacy Practices of Linguistic Minorities: Sociolinguistic Issues and Implications for Literacy Services	1999	Literacy, as it applies to linguistic minorities, is examined as a discourse of power in this theoretical article. Literacy needs to be redefined in order for librarians to be able to provide people whose languages are not the dominant or official ones in society with appropriate literacy services. This redefinition recognizes the politics of language and literacy, challenges the mainstream (dominant culture) concept of literacy, and includes (1) expanding the definition of literacy that takes into account the language and cultural knowledge of linguistic minorities, (2) examining the nature of literacy and literacy practices of linguistic minorities from a social perspective, and (3) understanding how the literacy of linguistic minorities is measured. By understanding these critical issues of adult literacy in linguistic minority communities, librarians can implement the proposed strategic directions for delivering appropriate literacy services to linguistic minorities.
A White Librarian in Black Harlem	1990	Ernestine Rose (1880-1961) was a pioneer in providing library services to blacks in Harlem at the 135th Street Branch of the New York Public Library from 1920 to 1942. She galvanized the resources of the community and applied the prestige of the New York Public Library to plan, execute, and promote library services at a time when blacks were moving in large numbers to New York after World War I. Under Rose's leadership, the branch became a model of public library services to an underserved minority. The purpose of this study is to chronicle and assess her work during the Negro Renaissance, a dynamic period of the community's history.
Google Books, Libraries, and Self-Respect	2016	If Google Books has been successful in furthering the cause of social justice with regard to information, it is along narrowly distributive lines. Drawing on critics of distributive justice and emphasizing the value of self-respect, the author argues that Google's massive digital scanning initiativeâ€”especially as compared to the liberal democratic institution of the public libraryâ€”exposes and exacerbates injustices with regard to information, technology, and institutions that are not easily captured along distributive lines. In particular, attention is paid to three features of the projectâ€”the quality of Google's book scans, the politics of online search, and Google's conception of the value of informationâ€”as demonstrative of the too-slender foundation for self-respect the Google Books project offers its users.
Library History without Walls: Clio's Decalogue Revamp'd for the Untenur'd . . .	1995	The neglect of library history is taken for granted, even if it is undeserved, and even if proposals have been regularly advanced for improving its status. One of the most prevalent salvos proposed focuses on interdisciplinarity and publishing outside the field of librarianship. Few if any writers have addressed the problem of how the novice professor with a genuine research interest in library history can meet the requirements of tenure by pursuing a low-status specialty, endure the rigors and expense of historical research, and gain the respect of peers, while at the same time promoting the value of the subject outside the field. This article suggests that in order to survive as library historians and library educators, some of the conventional wisdom surrounding tenure tactics may need to be disregarded or modified.
Recruitment of Library School Faculty	1986	Library schools primarily recruit teachers by contacting individuals known in advance to the dean and/or faculty or by publicizing an opening and soliciting applications. The first is operative most frequently in the recruitment of information scientists and senior faculty. The Chronicle of Higher Education appears to be the most effective medium for the second approach. The annual ALISE meeting plays an important role in the recruitment process as well.
Web-Supported Teaching in the Department of Information Science at the University of Pretoria	2002	In order to support the mission of the University of Pretoria (South Africa) the tuition methods in a number of modules in the Department of Information Science have been transformed from traditional classroom presentations to a learner-centered approach supported by web-based material in a flexilearning environment. A comparison is drawn between the honors (fourth year) program in library and information science (LIS) and the undergraduate program in multimedia with regard to program outline, student profile, teaching methods, the support of the Academic Information Service (AIS) and information technology (IT), as well as the attitude of the students toward the changes. Qualitative methods of data collection were used. Problems and successes are highlighted. In conclusion, a number of recommendations are made.
Unitarianism and the Iconography of Democracy: Decorations for the Library of Congress	2010	The building and decoration of the Library of Congress in the late nineteenth century were emblematic of America's longing to be regarded as an enlightened nation and to take its rightful place among the great civilizations of the past. The sources for this ambition, illustrated in the paintings, sculptures, and inscriptions in the library's reading room rotunda, are a reflection of the ethical humanitarianism of Unitarianism, which advanced a modern concept of civilization that, in the decoration of the Library of Congress, became the intellectual underpinnings for the construction of a democratic, civic iconography.
Conceptual Strategies for Operationalizing Multicultural Curricula	1992	This paper discusses the challenges and opportunities that multiculturalism presents to library and information science education. Multiculturalism here is synonymous with cultural diversity and denotes the recent critical concepts that are counterposed to ethnocentrism, cultural monolithicism, and the assumption of epistemological universality. The aim of this essay is to develop conceptual strategies that will contribute to the operationalization of a multicultural curriculum. To provide that framework, the discussions draw upon concepts and literature from a variety of research fields that deal with the role of culture in human cognitive processes and informational behaviors. These include anthropology, cross-cultural psychology, ethnocognitivism, and intercultural communication.
Historical Research as Critical Practice and Relationship: The "Carnegie Libraries in Iowa Project"	2003	The Carnegie Libraries in Iowa Project (CLIP) is an interdisciplinary project that seeks to chart the history of Iowa's Carnegie libraries by creating a digital library of images and other documentary and statistical information to be made publicly available over the World Wide Web. Using CLIP as a starting point, and by using critical methods to analyze the records from sociological, historical, architectural, aesthetic, and technical perspectives, library users ranging from humanities scholars to school children are encouraged to study the history of Iowa's Carnegie libraries in the context of their changing communities. CLIP represents a partnership among faculty, students, and staff at the University of Iowa's School of Library and Information Science (SLIS), Iowa's library practitioners, and members of Iowa communities, including high school and college students as well as members of the general public.
Intellectual Freedom Lectures and the Dilemma of Offense-Free Teaching	1997	Teaching intellectual freedom concepts to library and information science students has become increasingly problematic due to faculty, university administration, and student confusion about what constitutes sexual harassment and racial discrimination, and what the boundaries of academic freedom may be. Discussion of intellectual freedom issues often centers on issues such as homosexuality and racial hatred which may cause student discomfort and embarrassment. Disagreement about the parameters of university racial and sexual harassment codes and ambiguity of language within these codes can lead to students misinterpreting intellectual uneasiness as harassment. An examination of codes from universities with ALA-accredited library and information science programs reveals the weaknesses in these codes and the lack of protection afforded to those teaching controversial topics.
â€œTunnel Vision and Blind Spotsâ€ Reconsidered: <em>Part of Our Lives</em> (2015) as a Test Case	2015	In 1999 Library Quarterly published the author's article â€œTunnel Vision and Blind Spots: What the Past Tells Us about the Present; Reflections on the Twentieth-Century History of American Librarianship.â€ In it he argued that library and information studies (LIS) research and discourse suffered from a narrow perspective that limited its ability to discern a wider range of contributions and roles libraries played in their host communities. In this follow-up article, by harnessing conclusions emanating from research for his new book, â€œPart of Our Livesâ€: A People's History of the American Public Library (2015) as a test case, the author argues that LIS discourse and research continue to manifest tunnel vision and blind spots that limit librarianship's ability to more deeply understand its present circumstances and more prudently prepare for its future.
Profiles of Constituent Groups: Indicators of Effectiveness of Schools of Library and Information Studies	1995	This article is the first in a series of reports on the indicators and dimensions of effectiveness that constituents of American Library Association (ALA)-accredited programs of library and information studies (LIS) believe are useful for evaluating the host schools. Members of the four constituent groups were surveyed: senior academic administrators, ALA's Committee on Accreditation (COA), employers of alums, and alums. The distinct nature of each constituent group is profiled by focusing on the preference each gives to the placement of seventy effectiveness indicators. In addition, brief description is given of twenty-four indicators upon which the constituent groups exhibit their greatest agreement.
What Sound Does an Odyssey Make? Content Analysis of Award-Winning Audiobooks	2015	AbstractFor decades, education and library science professionals have encouraged use of audiobooks for children and adolescents. More recently, professional associations have conferred recognition for exemplary audiobooks. Although it is generally accepted that high-quality materials should be used for teaching and learning purposes, no studies have explored elements of quality in audiobooks. This article describes a content analysis of Odyssey Awardâ€“winning audiobooks. The purpose of this study was to answer the question â€œWhat are the typical characteristics of an award-winning audiobook produced for children and/or young adults?â€ Results demonstrate that award-recognized audiobooks for children and young adults vary widely in a number of factors. Implications for libraries and future research are discussed.
The Use of Public Libraries by Native Americans	2007	Library services to Native Americans have expanded greatly in the past several decades, but more work still needs to be done to provide for the information needs of Native Americans. Data from the U.S. Current Population Survey were used to compare library use rates of Native American households to rates of Anglo households. Results show that Native Americans still lag behind Anglos in public library use rates. Of households that report library use, Native Americans are more likely to engage in certain types of library use than are Anglos. Socioeconomic and geographic variables are indicated as factors in the lower library use rates of Native American households. Study results could be useful for groups working to improve Native American library and information services.
Social Justice as Topic and Tool	2016	Training culturally competent and socially responsible library and information science (LIS) professionals requires a blended approach that extends across curricula, professional practice, and research. Social justice can support these goals by serving as a topic of inquiry in LIS curricula as well as by providing a scholarly framework for understanding how power and privilege shape LIS institutions and professional practice. This article applies social justice as a topic and tool for transforming LIS curricula and culture by exploring the implementation of social justiceâ€“themed courses and an extracurricular reading group in one LIS department. Exploring curricular and extracurricular cases in a shared institutional setting contextualizes key challenges and conversations that can inform similar initiatives in other institutions. Transforming LIS culture to prioritize social justice values, epistemologies, and frameworks requires multivalent strategies, community buy-in, and shared responsibility in terms of the labor of leading and sustaining engagement with social justice.
â€œFor All the Peopleâ€	2016	Intellectual freedom is frequently seen as a core value of librarianship, especially by the American Library Association, which has issued extensive guidance to libraries about implementing intellectual freedom. Some scholars criticize these documents, arguing that they are unrealistic and do not offer meaningful support to libraries. While scholars question the value of ALA policies, it is unclear whether practicing librarians have similar concerns about the Library Bill of Rights (LBR) and related guidelines. This article describes a study of public libraries and their interpretation of the LBR in their daily practice. To investigate the role played by ALA documents, 15 public library directors across one state were interviewed. In general, the library directors did not directly cite or quote from ALA documents, yet their stances echoed ALA guidance. In addition, library directors frequently discussed the significance of community in their interpretations and implementations of intellectual freedom.
Segregating Propaganda in American Libraries: Ralph Ulveling Confronts the Intellectual Freedom Committee	1993	At the 1951 annual conference of the American Library Association, Detroit Public Library director and former ALA president Ralph A. Ulveling challenged the ALA's newly adopted Statement on Labeling with a proposal to segregate library materials containing propaganda into the reference collection and to make them available only to "researchers." His proposal forced the Intellectual Freedom Committee to confront the lack of consensus on intellectual freedom issues within the association. The necessity to respond with one voice to the issues raised by Ulveling preoccupied the committee for almost a year. The confrontation also caused the committee to make an educational effort, aimed at librarians, its top priority.
The Educating of Black Librarians: An Historical Perspective	1986	An historical overview of the participation of blacks in librarianship and library science education is presented. Historical as well as present day barriers to such participation are explored.
Victorian Horizons: The Reception of Children's Books in England and America, 1880-1900	1994	This article examines the critical reception of children's books in England and America, 1880-1900. The purpose of the study is to determine the nature and extent of interest in children's books in the formative period of the "golden age of children's literature." Which periodicals covered children's books, and how did their cultural discourse, as revealed through reviewing and commentary, shape the norms and assumptions by which children's books were created and evaluated? Seventy-five literary periodicals were studied for their coverage of children's books in this period. The literary periodicals are drawn from Poole's Index, Nineteenth-Century Readers' Guide, and Wellesley Index. Using reception theory, a branch of reader-response criticism, I construct the contemporary context in which children's books were received-expressed as "horizons of expectations." A spectrum of cultural discourse included the following horizons: the treatment of children's books as a commodity; the elevation of children's books as works of art; an emphasis on illustration and pictorial effects in literature; a lack of rigid demarcation between adult and children's literature; a growing gender division; a diversification of the didactic tradition; a continuing debate on fantasy and realism; the romantic idealization of childhood and its literature; attention to the historiography of children's literature; and anxiety about the changing character of children's reading. While these concerns informed the larger history of children's literature, they converged in late Victorian England and America to create a unique climate for the reception of children's books as a body of literature, a field of study, and a form of expressive culture.
On Community, Justice, and Libraries	2016	At the core of terms such as “inclusion,” “civic engagement,” “social participation,” and “social justice”—terms that this special issue is built around—are political concepts that have been plumbed deeply by political theorists. Two concepts that underwrite much of this terminology are community and justice, both robustly debated within political theory. It is the premise of this article that exploring those debates—definitions of justice and community put forward and argued—and proposing specific versions of those core concepts will provide a defensible basis for research deploying these terms and a practical raison d’état for the institutions of library and information science. Defensible constructs of community and justice with affinities to the field are particularly important in the current political era.
Diversified Research Methods Education in LIS	2017	A small number of LIS degree programs have adopted a diversified approach to research methods education, including offering an array of specialized research methods courses in addition to a general introductory course. The current study conducted an in-depth investigation of the diversified research methods curriculum of the LIS program at San Jose State University. The curriculum featured ten different research methods courses, and permitted students to make a selection to fulfill the requirement. Students tended to base their selections on individual interests, and reported a high level of satisfaction with their learning experience. The current study examined different aspects of the diversified curriculum from the student perspective, and reviewed the implications of this curricular model.
A Conceptual Framework for the Public Library as a Community Learning Center for Independent Study	1976	Public libraries, in responding to growing interest in adult independent study, are beginning to reexamine their role as community learning centers. Different kinds of learning centers emphasize: priority on provision of materials; collaboration with academic institutions and agencies through an independent study information and referral service; a multimedia center supported by educational counseling and study guidance; and a community task force approach which provides learning-center services in the midst of community problem solving. Differences among learners, learning situations, and learning styles as well as in library resources and community programs will affect the evolution of any particular public library community learning center.
The Community Engagement Model in Library and Information Science Education: A Case Study of a Collection Development and Management Course	2009	This article presents the Community Engagement Model (CEM) in library and information science (LIS) education based on a case study of a collection development and management course taught during two semesters involving thirty graduate students. Students partnered with self-selected community agencies to develop collections to meet the needs of particular audiences in varied community-based settings. The article also reviews the learning experiences from the perspectives of the instructor, students, and collaborating community representatives, including discussion of the course goals, assignments, methods, and community impact. Results show positive gains for both LIS students and the collaborating community agencies. LIS students gained an understanding of collection development variables at work in particular community-based information organizations. Community representatives reported that partnering with students made a positive difference in their agency owing to students' practical and timely choices, levels of knowledge and range of selections, and their consideration of financial and strategic factors relevant to the community. In a professional school, learning in community engagement activities places students in the field where they encounter challenges that make LIS work stimulating and fruitful. Additional examples of how to make community engagement a more effective part of the LIS curriculum are needed. The CEM presented in this article may help other LIS educators conceptualize their courses towards this goal.
Learning about Diversity: The Roles of LIS Education, LIS Associations, and Lived Experience	2015	AbstractHow do librarians learn about diversity? What role do library and information science (LIS) education and LIS associations play in developing that knowledge? How do librarians talk about diversity? We surveyed librarians across the United States, Canada, and a few other countries and found that life experience and media play a greater role in diversity knowledge than do LIS education, LIS associations, or LIS workplaces. Although diversity is still discussed largely in terms of race and ethnicity, our respondents also considered factors such as personality, cognitive style, political viewpoint, and socioeconomic status in their discussions of diversity.
Mobilization of Rural Libraries toward Political and Economic Change in the Aftermath of the 2016 Presidential Election	2017	The 2016 presidential election in the United States was unprecedented in the extent of bitter divisiveness between the candidates' campaigns, the complex factors attributed to the unexpected results, and the difficult years in which the nation will reel fromthe short- and long-term effects. In its aftermath, an aggravated, broken nation extends rural libraries an extraordinary charge to help mend the splinters and move forward in their local environments. They have an opening to take ownership of a compelling responsibility as agents of democracy toward political, economic, and civic recovery. This think piece analyzes the implications of the 2016 presidential election for rural libraries primarily as information service providers that can aggressively further political information literacy, fluency, and advocacy and economic development as tools to nurture a more refined, responsive, respectful, and relevant form of democracy in the twenty-first century than what we have seen recently.
Alternatives to Apathy and Indifference	2017	Public libraries depend on public support for their existence. This essay asks, What can and should public librarians do to contribute to civic education? It discusses librarianship, politics and neutrality, and funding. It looks to public statements of librarians in the immediate aftermath of the election, then turns back to what librarians were doing in the realm of civic participation and education immediately prior to the election. Evidence comes from popular articles, tweets focusing on libraries and the election, and an unscientific, post hoc survey of library event calendars. Recommendations include fostering communication and dialogue and participating in actions that foster truth and democracy.
Queering the Catalog: Queer Theory and the Politics of Correction	2013	AbstractCritiques of hegemonic library classification structures and controlled vocabularies have a rich history in information studies. This project has pointed out the trouble with classification and cataloging decisions that are framed as objective and neutral but are always ideological and worked to correct bias in library structures. Viewing knowledge organization systems from a queer perspective, however, challenges the idea that classification and subject language can ever be finally corrected. Engaging queer theory and library classification and cataloging together requires new ways of thinking about how to be ethically and politically engaged on behalf of marginal knowledge formations and identities who quite reasonably expect to be able to locate themselves in the library. Queer theory invites a shift in responsibility from catalogers, positioned to offer functional solutions, to public services librarians, who can teach patrons to dialogically engage the catalog as a complex and biased text, just as critical catalogers do.
Women in Southern Library Education, 1905-1945	1992	Southern library education was an almost exclusively female enterprise until about 1930, when the first male students were accepted into the region's only ALA-accredited library school. In the formative (ca. 1905-30) and developmental (ca. 1930-45) years of southern library education, regional attitudes toward gender, race, and class, and the South's impoverished economic climate, shaped the way in which library education was adapted to meet regional needs. The "old girl network" of library school alumnae, community leaders, and even untrained librarians represented a formidable coalition for library advocacy that even the region's much publicized illiteracy, bigotry, and general backwardness could not deter.
"The Place to Go": The 135th Street Branch Library and the Harlem Renaissance	2003	In the early 1920s, the 135th Street Branch of the New York Public Library, under the leadership of Ernestine Rose, played a significant role in the Harlem Renaissance movement. By drawing on the resources of the community, the library staff facilitated connections between writers and their readers with literary gatherings; between artists and their viewers with art exhibitions; and between playwrights, performers, and their audiences with theatrical productions. But the library's most significant legacy was its book collection, now known as the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, which has provided a permanent connection between a people and their history.
Beyond Market Models and Resistance: Organizations as a Middle Layer in the History of Reading	2009	Two theoretical models dominate discussion of research methods in the history of reading: “market” models such as Robert Darnton’s communications circuit and “resistance” models such as those that draw on Michel de Certeau’s concept of poaching. This article suggests that both make important contributions but also have limitations, especially when researching later nineteenth‐ and twentieth‐century print culture. An alternative approach considers institutional sites of print as a middle layer that can bridge the gap between structure and agency and between macro and micro views. These sites are also spaces where activities of reading and writing may intersect, since they provide opportunities for individuals to both produce and consume texts. Moreover, an explicitly institutional view gives researchers a window onto the acts of reading and writing by nonelite groups for whom few individual records survive.
User-Centered Design for Information Professionals	2001	Most information professionals would agree that user-centered design makes an important contribution to high quality information systems. However, there is no general agreement about how to define the term "user-centered design," or how best to implement user-centered design strategies in the development of systems and services. This paper describes a wide range of meanings associated with user-centered design in information studies and in other cognate disciplines, and argues for a more coherent and widely accepted definition. It proposes that a general definition of usercentered design drawn from the literature of human-computer interaction (HCI) could serve as a basic framework for system design and support interdisciplinary work. It also describes some useful methods of implementing this framework in the development of user-centered information systems.
Positioning Master's Programs in Library and Information Science: A Template for Avoiding Pitfalls and Seizing Opportunities in Light of Key External and Internal Forces	2002	At the same time that professional master's programs in fields like library and information science (LIS) are experiencing unprecedented growth, there are emerging pressures on master's education. In broad strokes, this paper identifies the major external and internal forces influencing professional master's education and, in turn, proposes a framework for avoiding potential pitfalls and seizing opportunities in positioning master's programs in library and information science for the foreseeable future. After examining four internal and five external forces affecting master's programs, the paper reviews and then critiques a trio of popular models for responding to these forces. The paper concludes by advancing five courses-of-action aimed at helping LIS program faculty and administrators respond to the external and internal forces acting on their programs.
Student Concerns in Choice of Library School	1980	Surveys of library school students at Emporia State University have shown location, cost, accreditation, reputation of the school, familiarity with the parent institution, program content, public relations and publicity, and the availability of a full summer program and off campus courses influenced their choice of library school. A study of library school catalogs and other information pertinent to the nine factors brought out in the surveys showed that the 61 accredited library school programs in the United States offer prospective students much variety in each category. Even in matters of admission standards and program content accredited library school programs show little standardization. Those considering a career in librarianship or an allied field have a wider choice than ever before.
Library Education in Israel	1981	This article describes the history of library education in Israel as observed and recorded by an active participant in a portion of its development. As such, some measure of subjectivity is to be expected. (Written from a different perspective, a thorough survey of Israeli library education until the 1960' s is provided by C. D. Wormann, 1963.) Although historical periods are included in this account, it should be remembered that when considering any social process, clear demarcation cannot be made and the divisions here merely mark major turning points.
Toward a New Model of the Information Professions: Embracing Empowerment	1997	In redefining the information professions for the twenty-first century, it is important to consider the core values embraced by these fields and to examine the relationship of professionals to their clients and to other professions. Because other models have failed to take account of professional-client interaction, this paper presents a new client-centered typology of the professions. Special emphasis is given to the empowering professions (such as psychology, social work, education, and librarianship), which all share the goal of enabling their clients to use knowledge for the purpose of taking control of their own lives. After offering a critique of the unquestioned assumptions and androcentric biases underlying modern theories of professionalization, this article presents a feminist perspective that validates the ethic of care in professional practice and acknowledges the importance of those professional activities whose goal is to diffuse knowledge, not to guard or control it.
U.S. Government Information Policy	1988	The purpose of this article is to provide an understanding of the federal information policy. Some definitions of that policy will be provided along with an idea of the range of issues being covered. Some of the current actors and policy initiatives are highlighted, as are suggestions of ways faculty can participate in the policy process.
Teaching the Cataloging of Non-Book Media	1978	A course in the cataloging of non-book media may need to include a number of diverse cataloging codes in addition to a wide variety of media. This breadth of scope can benefit from a consideration of questions on the nature of media. Related areas of concern are the objectives of an access system for non-book media, and the means by which these objectives can be achieved. The medium of film is provided as an illustration of this approach.
Latino Librarians on Becoming LIS Educators: An Exploratory Investigation of the Barriers in Recruiting Latino Faculty	2004	Library and Information Science (LIS) schools have produced a limited number of Latino masters in library science (MLS) graduates, but they have not attracted them back to pursue doctoral studies and teaching positions. Using a semi-structured interview technique, eight "expert" Latino librarians were interviewed for their perspectives on the barriers preventing Latino LIS professionals from pursuing positions as LIS faculty. This exploratory investigation identifies four specific barriers which are perceived as contributing to the lack of Latino LIS faculty: isolation from the academy, ethnocentrism within LIS education, financial concerns, and personal concerns.
Gendered Narratives of Innovation Through Competition: Lessons From Science and Technology Studies	2013	Library and information science is a technologically intensive profession with a high percentage of women, unlike computer science and other male-dominated fields. On the occasion of the 2011 ALISE conference, this essay analyzes the theme "Competitiveness and Innovation" through a review of social psychology and science and technology studies literature. Both theme concepts have ramifications for LIS education. Librarianship and teaching are both professions that resist commodification because they rely on embodied labor and personal interaction. Competition, as a management or learning style, may not promote meaningful innovation in LIS education, and instead risks creating a climate that is hostile to its chief demographic. The feminization of LIS can be seen as a strength insofar as it promotes the relative parity in numbers of men and women full-time faculty. LIS education should build on this strength in its innovation practices, enabling friendly encounters between technologies, and men and women alike.
The Library Internship and Expo as a Pathway to Diversity: A Case Study	2006	College and university libraries need to develop undergraduate internships to encourage low-income and ethnic-minority students to enter the library profession. Such internships can be run on limited budgets. This article presents a case-study model for an internship program and its related promotional efforts currently in place at California State University, Bakersfield. The article discusses the need for greater ethnic diversity in libraries and the value of internships as a tool to confront minority underrepresentation in the library profession.
Thematic Mapping, Data Mapping, and Geocoding Techniques for Analyzing Library and Information Center Data	1995	Methodologies based on computerized geographical information systems (GIS) are appearing with regularity in the library and information science literature and conference proceedings. This article illustrates and discusses several specific GIS techniques available to LIS researchers, administrators, planners, and instructors. These techniques include thematic mapping (shading, coloring, or using various sized symbols to indicate amount and type), data maps (positioning actual data on maps rather than on tables), and geocoding (positioning addresses obtained from various reference sources to specific points on a map). Maps are used to illustrate the techniques recommended for more widespread use among library and information researchers.
The Application of the Usability Approach in Libraries and Information Centers for Resource Selection and Deployment	1998	Libraries and information centers most often rely on published reviews, vendors' demonstrations, brief visits to local sites, or word of mouth to select resources for in-house or public use. The usability approach developed in the field of human computer interaction (HCI) strives to test the ease of use, user satisfaction, and effectiveness of software, hardware, and information products for a range of users. To understand how users interact with products, usability analysts employ methods from task analyses and rapid prototyping in informal settings to talk-aloud protocols in specially equipped usability laboratories. For example, OCLC and Lexis-Nexis have maintained usability laboratories for several years to assist in the design of their software products. The application of the usability approach for research in information studies and to support library and information center purchase and implementation decisions holds much promise. This work presents an overview of the major methods of usability analysis and indicates how they can be used efficiently and effectively by information professionals in real work environments to improve selection and deployment of hardware, software, and information products. Also included is a discussion of the current and future role of usability in the formal education of information professionals.
Doctorate Recipients in Library Science: How They Compare with Doctorate Recipients in Other Disciplines	1992	Characteristics of doctorate recipients in library science were compared with those in other disciplines to identify factors that may aid in the recruitment and retention of Ph. D. students in library and information science programs. Factors explored include: (1) trends in the annual production of doctoral degrees; (2) characteristics of LIS doctorate recipients, including gender, race, citizenship, undergraduate major, institutions of higher education attended, median age, median length of time taken to complete the doctorate, and postdoctoral plans; and (3) differences between those library science doctorate recipients planning to teach and those planning other professional careers. Data were derived from a special tabulation of the National Research Council's annual Survey of Earned Doctorates, 1970-1990. Interviews with deans/directors responsible for administering library and information science doctoral programs were also conducted to ascertain what they consider to be major challenges facing them in regard to recruitment and retention of doctoral students at their own institutions.
The Impact of Differing Orientations of Librarians on the Process of Children's Book Selection: A Case Study of Library Tensions	1978	This paper represents an attempt to apply current organizational theory to the understanding of a large juvenile library system's selection goals and guidelines. Writings on goal conflict within organizations suggest that the two groups characteristically involved in a large library's book selection process, the coordinators and branch librarians, would display differing orientations toward the process which would result in conflicting objectives and organizational tensions. A case study using nonparticipant observation, interviews, and a questionnaire survey was carried out to examine this hypothesis. The findings challenge the traditional view of forces guiding book selection in a children's library.
Combining Qualitative and Quantitative Methodologies to Study the Effects of an Academic Boycott on Academics in South Africa	1993	This article presents a comparison of data relating to the same phenomenon but deriving from different methodologies. A mail survey and interviews were used to assess the effects of an academic boycott on South African academics. The mail survey included categorical and open-ended questions that measured reports of direct experiences of the boycott tactics as effects of the boycott. The open-ended questions indicated themes of effect of the boycott for further exploration through focused interviews. Focused interviews were used to provide depth and specificity of the effects through the personal accounts of a subsample of respondents. Analysis of the data supported the value of looking at effects of the boycott in different ways. The quantitative survey data indicated that 57.3 percent of the respondents claimed a direct experience of one or more boycott tactics, while the qualitative data derived from interviews revealed significant psychological effects on South African academics.
Books for Black Children: Public Library Collections in Louisville and Nashville, 1915-1925	2000	In the early twentieth century, both Louisville, Kentucky, and Nashville, Tennessee, provided racially segregated public library collections and services. In each case, children became a central focus of the work. Librarians who developed the children's collections in library branches staffed and used exclusively by African Americans were limited by the need to educate as well as entertain, the dearth of books published for and about African-American children, and the professional practice of relying on standard selection guides. The children's collections in Louisville's and Nashville's black branch libraries held many of the same books available in other public libraries, and some of those books included demeaning characterizations and images of African Americans. Branch librarians mediated between the children and the collections, creating services, such as story hours and reading clubs, that supported interpretive communities of young African American readers.
Alphabet and Bibliological Terms in Some Early Judeo-Christian Literature	1970	Texts presented from the "Gospel of Pseudo-Thomas" and the "Contra haereses" of Irenaeus (both written before A.D. 200) employ the word "alphabet," and are earlier than D. Diringer's citation for its first appearance in literature. Bibliological terms found in the "Apocrypha" and "Pseudepigrapha" of the Bible and some early Christian literature are translated and presented in their context and discussed. It is concluded that some terms are not adequately treated in the standard lexica; thus thorough examinations of such terms in individual Christian writers of this early period are still needed.
Trapped in Our Own Discursive Formations: Toward an Archaeology of Library and Information Science	2003	This article introduces Michel Foucault's "Archaeology of Knowledge" as a way of addressing what Wayne Weigand has termed "tunnel vision and blind spots" in the discipline of Library and Information Science (LIS). Invoking Foucault's Archaeology in the context of Wiegand's problematic provides a framework in which to understand (1) how the discursive formation of LIS is itself a problem to be analyzed beside others, (2) how the nature of the discursive formation hinders potentially fruitful research in LIS, and (3) how understanding Wiegand in terms of Foucault can help to generate a new self-reflexive and critical attitude among LIS scholars to their own discursive formation and the discursive formations of others.
The Access Gap: Poverty and Characteristics of School Library Media Centers	2011	Stephen Krashen believes that schools can counter the effects of poverty in at least one area: access to books. However, little research has been done to determine whether students living in poverty have access to school library services comparable to those attending schools with low concentrations of students living in poverty. We examined the school library access gap; namely, the differences in school library characteristics (staffing, books added to collection, schedule, and number of days closed) in schools with various concentrations of students living in poverty. Alarmingly, we found that the students in most needâ€”those attending schools with the highest concentrations of students living in povertyâ€”had the fewest school library resources to draw on. Findings suggest that if we hope to close achievement gaps between high and low socioeconomic groups, we must attend to the access gap in school libraries in high- and low-poverty schools.
Inducing Attitudinal Change among Librarians	1971	Using the semantic differential, the attitudes of 35 public librarians participating in a training program on library service to the inner city were measured before and after the conference. A group of 30 public librarians in similar positions in large cities was randomly selected and measured with the same instrument to serve as a basis of comparison and control. Three of the five concepts testedâ€”Community Involvement in Planning Library Programs, The Urban Poor, and Library Institutes as Educational Devices underwent statistically significant changes as a result of the five-day institute. Comparing the post-test scores of participants and the control group reveals that participants' opinions of four of the five issues moved in the opposite direction from the views of their colleagues. A discussion of two competing theories of why attitudes change in institute settingsâ€”interpersonal context versus ideational content follows, with hypotheses for testing their relative influence.
A Conceptual Model of Factors Influencing the Outcome of Challenges to Library Materials in Secondary School Settings	1993	This study addresses the research question, "What are the variables that influence the outcome of challenges to school library materials at the secondary level?" A conceptual model is provided that describes the outcome of challenges to materials in terms of retention, restriction, and removal. The model was derived from research findings in library and information science, educational administration, behavioral science, and communications and suggests that the path from the challenge to the outcome is complex. The model contains several classes of variables, including district materials selection policy; school environment; community environment; and initiator of challenge. Variable classes of special interest in the present study are the characteristics of the librarian, which emphasize the psychological factors of locus of control and dogmatism, and complaint background, which focuses on whether the complaint was oral or written and whether there was active support for the retention or the removal of materials. The validity of the model was tested using survey research methods with a national sample of school librarians reporting challenges to materials. The results were found generally to support the model.
Old Skills and New Practices Mean Radical Change for Library Education	2016	Technological advances and other societal change have resulted in public libraries' increased reliance on online resources when providing access to information. However, a portion of those served by public libraries includes members of urban poor populations who may prefer to interact with information by talking. How can library educators ensure graduates are prepared to serve these populations? Using the participatory action research method this paper reports the Oral Present research project. This project is part of an on-going study conducted to identify how public libraries studied meet the information needs of this constituency. Results reveal how current service practices involve a radical twist on using traditional collection development skills. Discussion includes recommendations to ensure library education curricula can better prepare graduates for applying age-old professional practices in radical new ways.
Employee Turnover among Full-Time Public Librarians	1989	Analysis of employee turnover is common in business and industry. Understanding the cause and magnitude of turnover can help assess basic aspects of the organization such as the adequacy of pay, hiring practices and evaluation procedures, fairness of supervision, effectiveness of communication, and quality of leadership. Unfortunately, turnover analysis in librarianship is rare. The purpose of this study is to examine employee turnover in thirty-one public libraries in the Midwest. Particular emphasis is placed on establishing base-line turnover rates and examining the relationship of gender to turnover behavior. Among the findings are that (1) turnover rates are low compared to other occupations and (2) turnover rates of males and females are similar, but females are more likely to leave their jobs for family and personal reasons.
Labor Market Segmentation and Librarian Salaries	1987	Librarian earnings functions have been found to differ by type of library and by sex within library type. The present study uses segmented labor market theory to explain how the structure of the library labor market may determine salary differences by type of library. Data on the public, academic, and school library labor markets are used to show that the library labor market is segmented by type of library; that this segmentation contributes to the observed differences in earnings functions by type of library; and that the segmentation of the library labor market reflects segmentation of the labor market generally. A secondary result of this study is that it shows the value of intraoccupational studies like this one for a full understanding of labor market segmentation. By finding evidence of labor market segmentation at the intraoccupational level, it shows that the more usual approach to segmented labor markets, comparing entire occupations or industries, may obscure important differences.
Constraints on the Development of Public Library Service in Nigeria	1985	Despite much development since its introduction into Nigeria in 1946, public library service is used today by less than 1 percent of the population. This article, based on a review of the literature and on eight years of library experience in Nigeria, attempts to explain why. The main constraints have been the irrelevance of the service offered to the illiterate, who compose up to two-thirds of the adult population, and the fact that those who are literate and have access to libraries rarely use them for other than educational purposes and stop using them when their educational goals are achieved or given up. Other constraints include the redivision of Nigeria into smaller internal units; lack of professional leadership, government legislation, backing, and financial support in certain states; staffing problems; and the difficulty of extending service outside the urban areas.
Library and Information Science Students' Feedback in an Online Course	2011	The aim of the current research is to analyze the content of the messages expressed by LIS students in online courses as feedback, with the purpose of understanding the main themes being articulated by LIS university and college students, and examining whether there is a difference between the themes of LIS university students and those of LIS college students as revealed in their feedback. The paper provides a quantitative and a qualitative content analysis of feedbacks assigned to an online course taught in Israel. Findings show that the major theme expressed in LIS student feedback is their personal impression of their online experience, followed by the reflection category and the collaboration one. The smallest categories focus on course material and on course management. Furthermore, findings present that LIS university students are more satisfied with their online learning experience and that LIS university students discuss and express more reflective, analytic meta-cognitive aspects of the learning process than their LIS college counterparts.
Teens, Technology, and Libraries	2016	A growing body of research examines teens' use of digital technologies to meet their academic and personal information needs, but few studies have considered how public and school libraries fit into modern teens' information practices. This study uses data from surveys of and interviews with 25 teens enrolled in a highly technological urban US high school to consider how the prevalence of technology in their daily lives has influenced their perceptions and use of libraries. The results indicated that this group of students tended to think of libraries as largely outdated institutions with little connection to their technology-focused daily information practices. Thus, libraries might better serve teens with high levels of technology access by reframing their services in terms of promoting social interaction and community building as well as focusing less on providing materials and technology access and more on teaching how to search and evaluate information housed outside of libraries' physical and virtual boundaries.
Librarians as Organic Intellectuals: A Gramscian Approach to Blind Spots and Tunnel Vision	2003	In the January 1999 issue of "Library Quarterly," Wayne Wiegand suggests that library and information science (LIS) has failed to critically examine its role in relations of power and knowledge that systematically marginalize the needs of less powerful members of society. What we know, and what we allow ourselves to know, about libraries and their users is conditioned by history and politics. The work of Antonio Gramsci can help us to understand this situation. Librarians and scholars of LIS occupy a space that is contested terrain in a war of position between the hegemony of the capitalist historic bloc and the subjects who would challenge that bloc to be true to its self-declared principles of democratic participation. Gramsci's insights regarding the nature of capitalist social formations, and the role of intellectuals organic to these formations, reveal the ambivalent social position of LIS as a source of both support and resistance to capitalist hegemony.
Building Support Services for African-American Students: Part I	2001	This paper was presented at the 2001 Association for Library and Information Science Education Annual Conference, January 9-12, 2001, in Washington, D. C.
A Utilitarian Case for Intellectual Freedom in Libraries	2001	The article begins with an outline of the history of censorship and intellectual and expressive freedom in American libraries, chiefly from the last quarter of the nineteenth century until the Social Responsibility movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Discussion of the two main types of ethical theory, utilitarianism and deontology, is next. Then the deontological position on intellectual freedom is presented in the context of its theory of rights. The discussion of deontology is followed by a utilitarian criticism of the deontological defense of intellectual freedom. Then a utilitarian defense of intellectual freedom is offered and applied to libraries. The article concludes by arguing that, even though in theory utilitarianism would countenance some censorship, in practice the utilitarian will support complete intellectual freedom. It is maintained that libraries have a special role to play in promoting unconditional intellectual freedom.
A Critical Analysis of the Equity of LIS Education Programs in Sri Lanka	2008	A major study involving critical analysis of library and information science (LIS) education in Sri Lanka was carried out by the author covering the 2004-2007 period, and the equity of LIS education discussed in this paper was one element of the larger study. The study on equity has three objectives: (1) to provide a brief introduction to the LIS education programs and the institutions which offer those programs in Sri Lanka; (2) to analyze critically the equity of the LIS programs; and (3) to make recommendations for improvement. Four principal methods were used to collect the data required for the main research; semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, review of relevant documents, and participatory observations by the researcher. Four criteria, namely gender, income, geographic region and language, were used to analyze the equity of LIS education programs. Findings of the study established that there is a gender imbalance in the LIS programs with 80% to 90% female students, that an income inequity is evident, that there is a severe inequity in the regional distribution and language of the programs. The paper makes several recommendations to reduce these inequities and makes suggestions for further research.
Rural Public Libraries as Community Change Agents	2016	Rural residents are at a disadvantage with regard to health status and access to health promotion activities. In many rural communities, public libraries offer support through health information provision; there are also opportunities for engagement in broader community health efforts. In a collaborative effort between an academic researcher and a rural public library director in North Carolina, pedometers and an individualized online health self-assessment program were made available to library users. The activities were adopted enthusiastically. Feedback included encouragement for more such opportunities; some claimed the activities improved awareness and supported healthy behavior change. With minimal investment, rural public libraries can support healthy lifestyle activities. They also afford a unique environment where library staff can collaborate with researchers to introduce, assess and evaluate community health initiatives. As we train future practitioners, we should embrace the opportunities that rural public libraries can provide for collaborative initiatives to invoke positive community change.
To Reposition a Research Agenda: What American Studies Can Teach the Lis Community about the Library in the Life of the User	2003	American libraries do three things very well: (1) they make information accessible to millions of people on many subjects; (2) they provide tens of thousands of places where patrons can meet formally as clubs or groups, or informally as citizens and students utilizing a civic institution and a cultural agency; and (3) they furnish billions of reading materials to millions of patrons. For generations, the Library and Information Studies (LIS) community has devoted most of its attention to the first, but currently it is poorly positioned to undertake research on the second and third. American Studies, on the other hand, is well placed to address the second and third, but has largely overlooked American public, school, and academic libraries as subjects of study. This essay invites American Studies scholars to develop an LIS subspecialty in order to help the American library community better understand its present, so that it can more prudently plan its future.
Tunnel Vision and Blind Spots: What the past Tells Us about the Present; Reflections on the Twentieth-Century History of American Librarianship	1999	The twentieth-century American library is one of this nation's most understudied yet ubiquitous institutions, possessing a rich history of service to millions of users who over the generations have variably appropriated library collections and services for multiple purposes. For the most part, however, the library and information science (LIS) research community has failed to analyze the deeper meanings of these appropriations or to evaluate their significance for library users, in large part because it has yet to harness the ideas of many critical theorists whose thinking now dominates so much of the discourse occurring in other professions and academic disciplines. This article constitutes a reexamination of the twentieth-century history of American librarianship that is grounded on this thinking. It argues that contemporary LIS discourse is plagued with tunnel vision and blind spots that greatly limit the profession's ability to understand the role of the American library in the present accurately, and thus seriously affect the profession's efforts to plan the library's future.
Library-Based Summer Reading Clubs: Who Participates and Why?	2013	AbstractThis article reports on a research study designed to identify who participates in library-based summer reading clubs (SRCs) and why they elect to do so. To address this aim, questionnaires were completed by caregivers of 246 children upon enrollment to the SRC of a metropolitan library as well as 480 youth; the questionnaire was designed to learn more about enrollees with respect to basic demographics, home environment, and motivational attributes. Results of this study suggested that those who enroll in SRCs are relatively diverse with respect to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status; however, enrollees also tend to be motivated toward reading and to be capable readers. Implications for broadening community members' participation in SRCs are discussed.
Is There Counsel in Those Curtains? Research Agendas for the Times	2011	Presented as the keynote address at the Library Research Seminar, University of Maryland, October 7, 2010, this essay identifies and explores three agendas ever appropriate for study, the pursuits of which are especially needed now. They are as follows: to (1) explore the historical dimension of library topics, (2) revive study of the institution of the library in its historical dimension, and (3) orient research to lead adaptation to the times, particularly with regard to the relationships between libraries and other components of the information domain. Examples of opportunities and insights to be gained from study of topics in these agendas are drawn from the experience of exploring the history of the state library and archives of Texas.
Profiles in Retention Part 1: Design Characteristics of a Graduate Synchronous Online Program	2013	This paper Â¡s a case study of a Master of Library and Information Studies degree program online option that has been unusually successful in retaining and graduating students. Design characteristics of this program that has maintained a retention rate of over 90 percent over five years are described and mapped to the literature on distance education published after its implementation. The paper reports that characteristics identified in the practical and theoretical literatures are the same as, or closely related to, the characteristics of the program described. Student transcripts were used to track retention and time-to-completion. Topics for continuing study are identified and described. This is the first of two papers on retention in distance learning programs. The present paper (Part 1) addresses program design and implementation; Part 2 focuses on student responses to the online program option as they relate to student learning styles and outcomes.
Information Vaccine: Using Graphic Novels as an HIV/AIDS Prevention Resource for Young Adults	2014	HIV/AIDS infections are growing at an alarming rate for young adults. In 2009, youth, ages 13-29, accounted for 39% of all new HIV infections in the U.S. (Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 2011). South Carolina ranks eighth in the nation for new HIV cases, while the capital city of Columbia ranks seventh (Carolina Teen Health, 2012). Education and prevention efforts are needed to raise young adults' awareness of HIV/AIDS issues in order to reduce this troubling trend. To address this need, the researchers and a graphic illustrator worked with incarcerated students age 15-19 in the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice School District, to develop an age-appropriate, culturally-diverse graphic novel on HIV/AIDS, entitled AIDS in the End Zone. Phase I of the project was to create the novel. Once Phase I was completed, Phase II of the project began. During this phase, graphic novel book club interventions were held with young adults in public libraries in Columbia, South Carolina to measure knowledge gains and impact from reading the graphic novel. The purpose of this phase was to examine the role that graphic novels can play as a resource for increasing HIV/AIDS awareness among young adults. Phase II was funded by the 2013 ALISE Research Grant. The findings of the study are reported here. This study is the first of its kind to provide scientifically-based research that examines whether or not graphic novels can be an effective HIV/AIDS prevention tool for young adults. Implications for LIS education are discussed.
The Scattered Members of an Invisible Republic: Virtual Communities and Paul Ricoeur's Hermeneutics	2002	Communities, whether they are "real" or virtual, are mediated by interpretation. One's place within a community is also constituted by an ongoing metaphoric "reading" through which one attempts to understand what others within the community say and do. Virtual communities are unique in making such reading explicit through further acts of writing: participants form their communities through public performances of writing, reading, and interpreting of texts. Any analysis of virtual communities must take into account both the exchange of meaning through texts and the fact of a mediating distance between participants. The hermeneutic theories of Paul Ricoeur can support an analysis of these activities, which accounts for temporal and spatial distance in the exchange of the community's texts. Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory can be used to describe the process that drives virtual communities, which makes them into forums that attempt to "connect the scattered members of an invisible republic" [1, p. 43] in an electronic world.
In a State of Emergency: Libraries and Government Control in South Africa	1990	Six levels are identified in the South African censorship system, providing the context for consideration of one of them: the State of Emergency. Four categories of censorship emerge: prior censorship and suspension of publication; restraints upon information gathering; the suppression of anti-apartheid viewpoints; and the growth of militarization. The State of Emergency is seen as a microcosm of the system as a whole, and a comparison is made with "traditional" censorship of books. Emergency censorship is considered to be a radical tactical change whose impact on library resources and research in the humanities and social sciences is evaluated. In spite of the power and pervasiveness of the censorship system, it is concluded that there is still room for challenge and that a new breed of librarian is likely to play an important role in the process.
The Impact of Multimedia Course Enhancements on Student Learning Outcomes	2009	An online course was redesigned to use multimedia applications to improve student learning and promote meaningful engagement among classmates and course activities and materials. Consumer Health Informatics (CHI) is a masters-level course that examines Internet-based and telehealth models for delivering health information to consumers. When first offered in 2007, the delivery format was primarily textual. Following the course redesign in 2008, the course materials, including weekly topical discussion forums, projects, and course evaluations, were compared. Qualitative content analyses and statistical comparison of quantitative data demonstrated significant improvements in the level of students' engagement in course materials and with peers. Students' attitudes and perceptions recorded in course evaluations also showed significant changes.
â€œWhy Girls Go Wrongâ€: Advising Female Teen Readers in the Early Twentieth Century	2007	This article traces historical uses of the phrase “why girls go wrong” to provide a context for analysis of Progressive Era reading guidance for girls and then turns to actual girls’ responses to reading. The historic context depicts the milieu in which young women and the advisors who sought to guide them lived and read as a time of intense concern with adolescent female sexual activity. Further, the era also witnessed suspicion about the way that public spaces were used, particularly by women and girls. Librarians constructed, through arguments that selected titles that represented persuasively pure and feminine ideals, a female sphere in the public library. Images of the early twentieth‐century library as a wholesome, protective space for young women acknowledged contemporary social issues and responded to ensure that the bookish domains would be seen as appropriate venues for adolescent girls.
Historic Cataloging Costs, Issues, and Trends	1989	The length of LC cataloging cards in number of characters increased 24.5 percent between 1956 and 1981, the number of entries 130.2 percent, the number of fields 96.9 percent, and the number of subject heading subdivisions 156.2 percent. There is a trend toward longer and more complex cataloging copy and a small countertrend toward less than AACR2 cataloging. Most academic libraries, 69.2 percent, are unable to state what their cataloging costs are. Since 1876 the wholesale commodity price index has increased 729 percent, the price of gold (another measure of inflation) 1,590 percent, and the cost of cataloging for large libraries from $0.40 per volume to $17.17 per volume, or 4,292 percent. Since 1896 librarians' annual salaries have increased from $607 to $28,533 or 4,700 percent. Cataloging costs have increased faster than the rate of inflation, but more slowly than the rate of salary increases.
Aftermath of a Crusade: World War I and the Enlarged Program of the American Library Association	1980	Shortly after the United States entered World War I, the American Library Association (ALA) embarked on an ambitious program, the Library War Service, to furnish library materials and services to an American army of several million men. The considerable success of this wartime venture, coupled with the nation's postwar euphoria, prompted the ALA leadership to sponsor, in the early months of 1919, a project known as the Enlarged Program. The Enlarged Program was a major initiative to revitalize library services and to establish ALA as the dominant force in library affairs. Among the proposals were continuation of selected war-related services, closer liaison with other professional groups, new programs of service for adults and immigrants, promotion of library extension, certification of professional education, and constitutional revision. To achieve these objectives, a $2 million fund drive was authorized. Despite the best of intentions, the Enlarged Program turned into ALA's most humiliating defeat until that time. The objectives, campaign strategy, ideology, and reception of the Enlarged Program are considered and assessed.
Collection Development and Circulation Policies in Prison Libraries: An Exploratory Survey of Librarians in US Correctional Institutions	2012	Prison libraries have traditionally fulfilled many purposes for their incarcerated patrons, and these libraries often carry a diverse collection to serve varied patron needs. However, during the trial of Steven Hayes for the Petit family murders, the prosecution questioned the collection development policies of the institutions where Hayes had previously been incarcerated, requesting the reading lists in efforts to prove that his salacious choices in literature fueled his crimes. This request by prosecution brought two major issues into question, including (1) the collection development policies of US prison libraries and (2) the question of patron privacy in prison libraries. This article investigates current prison library policies on collection development and confidentiality of patron borrowing records through an exploratory survey of seventeen librarians currently working in correctional institutions throughout the United States. Their responses detail collection development policies in the prison library and present the ambiguity for handling the confidentiality of patron borrowing records.
Interracial Children's Books: Problems and Progress	1971	This article discusses why, in the middle 1960s, many writers, editors, and publishers became keenly aware that racial minority groups were very inadequately represented in children's books and considers some of what has happened in the past five years to redress this situation. The following four aspects of these subjects are treated: (1) factors which created interest in the problem of racial imbalance in children's books, with a brief history of racial attitudes in children's books published since the 1890s; (2) conditions which until recently have impeded publication of interracial children's books, descriptions of several recent series publications for teen-agers from minority groups, and reviews of the activities of the Council on Interracial Books; (3) the recent Black Power movement in the world of children's books; and (4) an evaluation of four recent interracial children's trade books.
Certification and Education for Library and Information Science	1984	Pressure from librarians about the quality and content of library education programs has combined with concern for affirmative action and the legal requirements for employee selection to create an uncertain future for the M.L.S. degree. Certification has been suggested as a means of assuring the quality of persons employed as librarians and as a means of maintaining the library profession's control over the education of librarians. The American Library Association is suggested as the organization most capable of mounting a valid certification program through competency examination. If certification became a reality it would affect accreditation, the content of library science courses, autonomy of library and information schools, and enrollment.
The Politics of Library Artifacts: The National<br/>Union Catalog	2004	This article presents case studies of the social shaping of the national union catalog (NUC) in seven countries (four in Central and Eastern Europe, two in the Baltic region, and South Africa). The purpose is to illustrate how technology developments do not occur independently of their social context but rather are coâ€constituted by the interaction between the various players involved. Interviews with library policy makers and project managers were conducted between 1999 and 2002. The key question investigated is how much of the development of a national union catalog is influenced by choices that are not solely technical but that include players' differing visions, the solutions that they feel they need to adopt, the difficulties they may encounter, and their cultural practices. Findings show that the variety of coalitions and their respective visions and choices have an impact on the conception and design of a national union catalog. The case studies also raise broader issues of technology diffusion, local knowledge, cultural practices, and national identity.
Reimagining the Role of School Libraries in STEM Education: Creating Hybrid Spaces for Exploration	2012	In recent years, many technological interventions have surfaced, such as virtual worlds, games, and digital labs, that aspire to link young people's interest in media technology and social networks to learning about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) areas. Despite the tremendous interest surrounding young people and STEM education, the role of school libraries in these initiatives is rarely examined. In this article, we outline a sociocultural approach to explore how school library programs can play a critical role in STEM education and articulate the need for research that examines the contributions of school libraries as potential hybrid spaces for STEM learning. We propose that school library programs become active participants in STEM learning through the specific roles that school librarians currently play in schools, such as information specialist, instructional partner, and technology ally. We also highlight how these roles can be tailored toward helping young people develop STEM identities.
The Humanistic Scholar and the Library	1980	This article seeks to address some of the implications of humanistic modes of scholarship for recent library developments. An attempt is made to characterize some of the essential habits of mind and scholarly needs of humanists as these affect issues in acquisition, allocation of funds, book preservation, computerization, problems of access to and use of collections. Some attention is paid to the changed and changing nature of humanistic research. In part the paper tries to respond to the proposition advanced by Don Swanson that a model of knowledge suggested by Karl Popper can serve to acquaint librarians with the mental habits of library users. Toward the end some questions are posed about the implications for the library profession and library users deriving from the close interrelation between problems of the library and society.
The Impact of Unions on Salaries in Public Libraries	1985	The objective of this study was to test the following hierarchical regression model: a library employee's salary is a function of (1) the size of the library, (2) the strength of public sector collective bargaining in the state, (3) the library's ability to pay, (4) the cost of living in the area, (5) the presence of any union in the library, and (6) the presence of a union representing librarians in the library. The model was tested on three salary levels: those of the department head, the beginning librarian, and the clerical worker. Results indicate that librarian union presence explains 5-14 percent of the variation in librarians' salaries. No significant amount of variation in the salaries of department heads or clerical workers is explained by librarian union presence. Simple union presence can explain 11-17 percent of the variation in the salaries of clerical workers. Simple union presence does not explain any of the variation in the salaries of librarians or department heads.
The Library in the Life of the Public	2017	Wayne Wiegand consistently put forward the research agenda of the library in the life of the user. A focus on libraries' publics is a useful variation: What, now, is the library in the life of its public(s)? In order to undertake this analysis, some practical definition of libraries' public(s) must be clarified, and how they might have changed in recent (neoliberal) times. With this background in place, an analysis of how publics now approach libraries is possibleâ€”and clarifies library responses within our current neoliberal environment.
Falling Short of Their Profession's Needs	2017	By taking a â€œlibrary in the life of the userâ€ rather than the conventional â€œuser in the life of the libraryâ€ perspective in his research on Part of Our Lives: A People's History of the American Public Library (2015), the author concludes that Americans have loved their public libraries for three reasons: information access, the library as place, and the commonplace stories that libraries supply by the billions. It is the view of the author that library and information studies research and education concentrate most attention on the first, hardly any on the last two, and as a result, fall short of meeting their profession's needs.
Does State Aid Stimulate Public Library Expenditures? Evidence from Pennsylvania's Enhancement Aid Program	2006	Pennsylvania public libraries began receiving increased allotments of state aid in 2000. In the first two years of enhancement aid, total state aid received by Pennsylvania libraries more than doubled. This reversed the trend of little growth in the years preceding 2000. The enhancement aid program also redesigned certain categories of state aid to increase incentives for local government support. Based on the principles from the economics of grants literature, an empirical model was employed to test the effect of state aid on library expenditures in Pennsylvania counties. Grant response was estimated by employing two separate equations in which library expenditures and state aid were simultaneously determined. It was found that expenditure response was significantly higher in the first two years of enhancement aid than it had been previously. Further, state aid stimulated increased local revenue financing in most years and in most counties. However, the degree of stimulation decreased in many counties during the enhancement period, thus providing them with tax relief.
Lcsh and Precis in Music: A Comparison	1985	By studying examples of their applications by the two major English language bibliographic agencies, this article compares the strengths and weaknesses of PRECIS and LCSH as regards books about music. Quantitative analysis reveals that the number of PRECIS subject statements exceeds LC subject headings except with more generic works. Qualitative analysis reveals serious problems with the terminology in both systems. LCSH frequently fails to combine unrelated subjects into a single heading, while subject statements in PRECIS are sometimes so long that significant aspects of the work cannot be adequately integrated. If the strengths of the selected subject entries of each system were combined, the result could be an improvement over each system alone, especially in an online catalog with the capability of single and random word order searches.
Library and Information Professional Education for the Learning Society: A Model Curriculum	1985	Library and information science education continues to be an important issue within the library and information professions. The library's role in modern society is analyzed and implications for library and information science education are stated. Drawing upon the recommendations of key professionals a program is delineated. Undergraduate preparation for librarianship is discussed, and the instructional objectives for required professional courses are articulated. Elective courses are suggested as well.
Out of Sight out of Mind: Why Don't We Have Any Schools of Library and Reading Studies?	1997	This article argues that current library and information science (LIS) thinking has drawn definitional boundaries around the word "information" so tightly as to exclude research on reading, a major means by which Americans obtain information, whether it comes off the printed page or the computer screen. This paper is intended to: (1) bring the dimensions of contemporary research on reading to the attention of the LIS community; (2) encourage LIS educators to consider the relevance of this research to a future they are preparing for the LIS professions; (3) ask provocative questions exploring race, age, gender, and especially socioeconomic class issues that, at this point, reside largely on the margins of our current professional discourse; and (4) suggest a "price" the LIS profession will pay if it continues to ignore reading research.
A Critical Discussion of "The Ethical Presuppositions behind the Library Bill of Rights"	2002	In "The Ethical Presuppositions behind the Library Bill of Rights," Martin FrickÃ©, Kay Mathiesen, and Don Fallis argue that the presuppositions of the Library Bill of Rights regarding censorship, access, and paternalism need revision. They also maintain that a revised Library Bill of Rights needs to rest on a sound philosophical foundation. The foundation they propose is John Rawls' version of social contract theory. I take issue with both claims. Regarding social contract theory, I argue that utilitarianism yields nothing to it regarding the types of materials that libraries should offer and who should have access to those materials. As for the Library Bill of Rights itself, I criticize parts of their interpretation and their positions on censorship, access, and paternalism. My main concern here is with the authors' defense of paternalism in libraries, which would commit them to Internet filtering. I dwell at some length on the dangers of filtering.
American Girlhood in the Early Twentieth Century: The Ideology of Girl Scout Literature, 1913-1930	1998	Juliette Gordon Low, a wealthy widow from Savannah, Georgia, founded the Girl Scouts of America on March 12, 1912. This organization, the first of its kind in the United States, promoted independence, patriotism, and self-sufficiency among young girls. This article's focus on the Girl Scout handbooks and the additional periodical literature produced by the organization provides important clues as to the kind of advice Low felt necessary to impart to these girls and the types of activities the organization promoted. Girl Scout handbooks and magazines provide insight into the degree to which the Girl Scout organization (1) promoted feminist ideology to young girls in the early 1900s, (2) expected a woman's sphere to be restricted to the realm of children, religion, and the home, and (3) encouraged women to display independence either surreptitiously or overtly. The Girl Scout handbooks lend insight into the evolving definition of gender roles through the instruction they imparted to young girls. The intended goals of the Girl Scouts, through a study of the Girl Scout literature, will help elucidate the expectations grown women, like Juliette Low, maintained for their youthful counterparts.
Childhood Socialization: Its Effect on Adult Library Use and Adult Reading	1984	This study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between certain childhood experiences and adult use of the public library and adult reading. Data were gathered via a nationally representative interview conducted by the Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan. The interview contained 25 questions relating to current reading habits, library use during the previous year, and childhood experiences related to reading and library use for the respondent and the respondent's parents. In addition, demographic data were obtained for the respondents. On the basis of usable responses obtained from 342 persons (95 percent of the persons interviewed), it was determined that heavy library users and readers were not unlike those characterized by earlier studies. A substantial number of childhood variables did prove to have statistical relationships with reading and library use. The results clearly indicated the importance of social learning and parents as primary agents in the development of reading and library habits.
Effective Teacher Behaviors in Higher Education and in LIS Education Programs: A Review of the Literature	1998	This article examines the literature related to effective teaching behaviors of postsecondary instructors in general and LIS educators in particular. Models for improving instruction in higher education are also considered. The conclusion points out that effective teaching is complex and multi-dimensional and that attention to specific teaching behaviors should take place within the context of a comprehensive plan for improving teaching and learning.
The International Exposition and the World Documentation Congress, Paris 1937	1983	The International Exposition in Paris in 1937 was of interest to librarians and documentalists for two reasons: an American exhibit of a major microphotographic copying project directed by Herman H. Fussler, and the meeting of the World Congress for Universal Documentation. These two events mark noteworthy stages in the development of library technology and international organization for purposes of bibliographic control.
A Critical Inquiry into Librarianship: Applications of the "New Sociology of Education"	1991	Much that is written about the library field does not take into account the social, political, and economic context in which libraries as institutions operate and in which librarians as professionals work. One field of scholarship that holds promise as a model of critical inquiry for librarianship is the new sociology of education. This article seeks to establish and apply such an inquiry through a review of the relevant aspects of the new sociology of education and application of those insights to current research and practice in libraries. Connections of librarianship to dominant political, social, and economic trends are stressed.
Dodging the Debate and Dealing with the Facts	2016	This study reports on an innovative, community-based effort to promote awareness and understanding of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) through a public library system in one southeastern county. Specifically, this study assesses the current knowledge, perceptions, and communication sources and needs regarding the ACA among adults in one southeastern county in an effort to determine the feasibility of establishing the public library as a trusted and nonpartisan source of ACA-related information. Results of formative research are discussed, and campaign development activities are chronicled. Findings indicate that public libraries can serve as a hub of information on important health-related issues through their efforts to communicate with, educate, and engage with the communities they serve.
Top Down versus Bottom Up: The Social Construction of the Health Literacy Movement	2012	The health literacy movement has been socially constructed over time. Unlike the consumer health information movement, which developed with broad public support, the health literacy movement has been fashioned primarily from the top down, initiated by policy makers and imposed on targeted populations. Interest in the health literacy movement has waxed and waned, often dependent on political agendas. In an era of increasing health care costs, it is not surprising that health literacy is once again at the forefront, given that economists and policy makers currently estimate the cost of limited health literacy in the United States to be between $1.6 to $3.6 trillion annually. Health literacy has been recognized as an issue key to the success of health care reform and to the continued advancement of the nation's status as an international leader where health and well-being are concerned. Yet, the health literacy movement has met with limited success.
Developing a Library School Course in Government Statistics	2004	Statistical information is one of the most important forms of government publication. Librarians receive some training in how to locate and use government statistical information in reference or government documents classes, but the coverage is usually cursory and most librarians could use more education. This paper reviews the literature and available print and electronic statistical resources and outlines a course for librarians in government statistics, suggesting classroom or self-study instructional methods; identifying key information on search strategies, ready reference sources, and detailed topical statistical sources; and suggesting issues for librarians to be aware of in helping their patrons locate and use statistics.
Using Literature to Teach in LIS Education: A Very Good Idea	2006	Reports on the effectiveness of using fiction in graduate education come from a variety of disciplines and professional fields. Perhaps the best known is the writing of Robert Coles, who speaks to the use of literature in educating doctors, lawyers, social workers, and teachers. But LIS education has done little to explore the potential of teaching with literature in our own discipline. Suggesting first a theoretical framework to support the combination of both the cognitive and the affective in higher education, this article goes on to report qualitative and quantitative findings that demonstrate the success of using fiction in LIS education. Finally, specific applications are suggested and described.
The Decisionâ€Making Process in Conspectus Evaluation of Collections: The Quest for Certainty	2004	Conspectus tools are used to gather collection data for a variety of reasons. Criticisms of the instruments are equally varied. Conspectus users frequently express uncertainty about the accuracy and validity of judgments about collections based on conspectus evaluations. An overview of decisionâ€making research demonstrates that uncertainty is common in most organizational decisions. Authors' interviews with thirteen experienced conspectors resulted in advice and insight into planning a conspectus project, managing group decision making, the role of personal confidence in the validity of decisions, ensuring balance of individual judgment and quantitative data, and selecting appropriate methodologies.
Knowledge/Power Transforming the Social Landscape: The Case of the Consumer Health Information Movement	2011	The consumer health information (CHI) movement is the result of various twentieth-century ideologies and is an outgrowth of the broader consumer movement. From a sociocultural and political perspective, the consumer, civil rights, and women's movements and related societal shifts helped pave the way for the consumer health movement, which laid the foundation for the CHI movement. All are examples of freedom of choice expressed through action and mirror a growing societal determination to exert control over important areas of one's life. The provision of consumer health information is a necessary support mechanism for that portion of health care focused on investing in risk reduction and shared decision making. As changes in the U.S. health-care system occur over time, access to CHI is likely to remain prominent and increasingly important to the ordinary person. Examining key components of the movement's origins helps elucidate both present and future trends.
Assessing iSchools	2012	Over the past decade, iSchools have emerged to educate the next generation of information professionals and scholars. Claiming to be edgy and innovative, how can and should these schools function in the spirit of assessment that now drives so much in the university? This essay, which explores how well we can assess iSchools, emerged from a doctoral seminar, Academic Culture and Practice, taught by Richard Cox and including four doctoral student participants and the Dean of School of Information Studies at the University of Pittsburgh, Ronald Larsen. The doctoral students, among other activities, were required to work on assignments to support a self-study for the University of Pittsburgh's reaccreditation by the Middle States Association. As we proceeded through the course, we found ourselves increasingly drawn to questions about how iSchools, in their nascent state, can assess themselves. Four major areasâ€”reputation, evaluating productivity in scholarly publishing, student evaluation of teaching, and student satisfaction with their academic programsâ€”that emerged based on student interest as the seminar proceeded are discussed.
Playing in the Past: A History of Games, Toys, and Puzzles in North American Libraries	2013	AbstractGames and other forms of play are used in today's libraries to attract underserved patrons, to introduce patrons to other library resources and services, and to facilitate engagement between library patrons. While many perceive gaming as a new library service, gaming services have been part of librarianship since the nineteenth century through chess clubs. During the Great Depression, libraries supported patrons with puzzle contests and developed circulating toy and game collections. Academic libraries built game collections for research and classroom needs, while school libraries collected and facilitated educational games to aid teachers. Video games have been used in libraries to help patrons learn to use technology and to bring groups of patrons together to enjoy shared experiences. The goal of this article is to demonstrate the different ways in which libraries have used games, toys, and puzzles over the last 150 years through both collections and services.
Using Focus Groups to Gather Information for LIS Curriculum Review	1998	This article presents a general description of focus group activity designed to generate information for use in making decisions about core and elective courses in a library and information science (LIS) curriculum. While the results reported may be specific to the environment studied, the process can be useful in a variety of settings. Faculty who wish to teach well may benefit from knowing what their constituents expect from new graduates of LIS programs. Moreover, successfully managed focus groups enable employers to experience involvement with LIS program review. This can produce valuable good will.
Information as Property and as a Public Good: Perspectives from the Economic Theory of Property Rights	1988	Some issues relating to property in information are reviewed in the light of recent work on the economic theory of property rights. According to this theory, costs of transaction are central to the evaluation of property rights and related public policy. Accordingly, special circumstances relative to transaction costs are considered in the cases of public libraries, photocopying, computer software, and satellite television feeds.
Library Operations Research: A Process of Discovery and Justification	1972	This article begins with a discussion of the broad role of operations research (O. R.) in a society undergoing change. The nature of O. R. teams in a library environment is then considered. The function of models in O. R. is analyzed, the development of a model being contrasted with its formal presentation. Criteria for good models are suggested. This article then focuses on storage models for libraries, first considering the Dewey classification system from this perspective and then summarizing more current research carried out under the direction of the author with a grant from the National Science Foundation.
Space Assessment as a Venue for Defining the Academic Library	2011	Purposeful assessment of space for the understanding and improvement of the academic library is a relatively new area of inquiry. This essay offers a framework to consider different factors affecting such an assessment and insights for undertaking a meaningful inquiry about the relationship of space to an academic library's evolving purpose as accumulator, service provider, and collaborative partner in learning and knowledge creation. The purpose of the assessment will vary according to the perspective of the library under examination. Paths for approaching such assessment include consideration of the assessment's purpose, types of questions posed by it, data-gathering methodologies, and reporting strategies of results. These paths are useful to gain insights into the evolving role of the library and its contribution to the academic enterprise. Not surprisingly, the inquiry turns as well to changes in the identity of librarians as separate from the building where they work.
Second Life: Exploring the Immersive Instructional Venue for Library and Information Science Education	2008	A two-stage study was conducted to examine how Second Life (SL) can be used in delivering Library and Information Science (LIS) education. At the first stage, the study surveyed the early adopters of SL from other disciplines in terms of their teaching practice in SL, and found that most educators used SL to create an environment for constructive and experiential learning as well as distance education; then the results were shared among the faculty at San Jose State University School of Library and Information Science. A following study was conducted among the faculty with regards to their intention of bringing their classes to SL. Findings indicated that there were interests in using SL to teach classes in areas like reference, library services for children and young adults, and library history.
The Awakening of the Social Conscience: Jane Maud Campbell, 1869â€“1947	2012	Jane Maud Campbell's career demonstrated her commitment and passion for library services with immigrants and minorities as one of the first advocates for multiculturalism in librarianship. She began her career working in the Newark Public Library and soon was employed as the librarian of the Passaic Public Library. She was the first woman employed by a state library commission to serve the needs of immigrants in Massachusetts. A prolific writer and champion of immigrants' rights within the American Library Association, she served for a brief time on the ALA Committee on Work with the Foreign Born in its initial years. She spent the later years of her career as a public librarian in Lynchburg, Virginia, during a period of segregation in the South. She worked around the edges of the law to make library service available to the African American community of Lynchburg.
The Collection and Use of Information by Some American Historians: A Study of Motives and Methods	1991	Previous literature on the information needs and uses of historians has tended to focus on the use of libraries and specific types of materials, rather than on the motivations for, and results of, such use. Yet understanding this prior process of historical inquiry might help us to develop improved services and facilities for scholars. A study of twenty American historians was conducted in order to better understand the nature of research in history. Respondents were asked about their choice of research topics, specific projects in progress, use of archives, categorization of materials collected, writing habits, and use of computers. Interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using standard, qualitative techniques. The results are discussed in the light of previous investigations of historians and the published statements of classification experts regarding the organization of historical knowledge. Suggestions for future study of historians are offered, and implications for libraries are explored.
Young Adults as Problems: How the Social Construction of a Marginalized User Category Occurs	2001	Two examples of the process of user categorization in professional communication are analyzed to show how marginalization occurs as a direct product of communicative activity. In one example of the process on a professional electronic discussion group, even while admitting that young adults avoid using the OPAC and seem uninterested in their information requests, the librarian blames them for their own behavior and absolves herself from any responsibility to help them. In another example, the representation of adolescents as "problem users" on a journal cover is examined. The implications of viewing communication as an explanatory, constitutive force that produces librarians' understanding of users are discussed.
Placing the Library: An Argument for the Phenomenological and Constructivist Approach to the Human Geography of the Library	2008	Place reminds us to tailor our professional work to the shifting concerns, and indeed the shifting criteria, of our shifting constituencies, rather than to a placeless professional vision of what librarianship, society, and literacy should be. Every place maker must make do, make sense, and make place in an environment that is technologically heterogeneous and in which the potential for novelty as well as recurrence is a persistent feature. The siege flag of place has been raised, not only in librarianship but in many sectors, in defense of the human and the parochial, of tradition and local turf. Taking a phenomenological cue, here we attempt to prune and redirect this problematic term. We arrive at what we consider reasonable criteria of success for ourselves: to what extent is our â€œlibrary,â€ in whatever professional sense we assign that word, vitally connected to the discursive practices of the places from which it draws its mandate? We contend that vitalizing a library in this respect requires us to step outside the sphere of our habitual familiarity and to explore other places. How we go about doing this is a matter of methodology. If a prior conception of place interferes with the absorption of ethnomethods, it should be held in suspension, bracketed at least until the practitioner can grasp the place that already exists.
Public Librarians and the Civil Rights Movement: Alabama, 1955-1965	2001	Racial segregation in southern public libraries affected millions of African Americans before the Civil Rights movement, and for librarians in the South it created a conflict between professional and regional values. Ultimately, it was the efforts of black activists rather than librarians acting on their ethical impulses that ended library segregation. Librarians were constrained by local racial customs, Jim Crow laws, and, often, by their own racial attitudes. Also, librarians recognized that there were inherent dangers associated with defying the segregationists. There were a few, however, who challenged the racial status quo, and these individuals demonstrated the potential of librarians to change society.
German Libraries and Scientific and Technical Information in Nazi Germany	1985	National Socialist policies drastically altered the roles of Germany's various scientific and technical library networks. The ability of the libraries in these systems to supply the results of current research to their users depended greatly on their access to foreign publications. Nazi ideological objections to foreign research were articulated in a series of laws and decrees that effectively prevented publicly accessible general state and university libraries from supplying foreign journals to their clientele. Technological university libraries, open to a smaller circle, grew in importance during the Reich both as collections and as agencies of dissemination to government and industry. Private industrial research libraries, using their own funds as well as the services of foreign subsidiaries, also flourished under the Nazis and profited from the additional dissemination services provided by the technological universities. The decline in general university libraries and the rise of industrial collections reflected the overall diversion of research under the Nazis from universities to the laboratories and proving grounds of industry.
On the Use of the Records of Research	1979	How much of what kind of knowledge of prior research is needed and wanted by those conducting research? Can it only be acquired, or is it best acquired, by the use of the original reports of prior research? Situational familiarity is the kind of knowledge wanted; historical familiarity with ancestral research is a conventional requirement differing in importance in different areas. The comprehensive literature search, often supposed to be a necessary preliminary to a new research effort, is usually unnecessary in theory and often unnecessary in practice. Working familiarity with research areas from which potentially useful contributions are expected is sought in proportion to the expectation of impact of others' work on one's own. Use of original research reports is not indispensable and is often an inferior means of acquiring the desired familiarity. Librarians and others exaggerate the need for bibliographic access to original research reports; greater development of means of avoidance of use of such reports would be of more value to research than further development of bibliographical access.
Library and Information Studies Faculty in Canada: A Sex Ratio Study	1995	This study looks at the sex ratio of women to men and related factors among library and information studies faculty in Canada by profiling 1971/72 and 1991/92 for comparison. The twenty-year span is intended to reflect the impact of feminism, the advent of automation, two-year master's programs, LIS doctoral programs, the 1972 accreditation standards, and faculty turnover. Primary sources of information are the 1971/72 directory issue of Journal of Education for Librarianship and the 1991/92 directory issue of Journal of Education for Library and Information Science, as well as library school catalogs. The sample comprises the entire population of full-time faculty in the seven currently accredited programs. Academic rank, doctorates held, and areas of teaching specialization are explored to identify differences between women and men. The findings indicate that the Canadian sex ratio, which is the reverse of the figures for North America in general, was the same in 1991/92 as in 1971/72. However, women and men have become more evenly distributed by rank and by area of teaching specialization. Recommendations for future research include a qualitative look at what influence sex ratio of LIS faculty has on students.
Making Sense of an Information World: The Everydayâ€Life Information Behavior of Preteens	2009	This article presents an empirically‐grounded framework for mediating the everyday‐life information worlds of youth aged 9–13. “Tweens” are a sandwiched population with behaviors, circumstances, and needs distinct from children and young adults. Little research has addressed their information‐seeking, especially regarding nonschool contexts. Thus, empirically‐based conceptual tools are needed to help professionals in mediating the complex information worlds of tweens. Guided by multiple frameworks (Dervin’s sense‐making, Fisher’s information grounds, and Chatman’s normative behavior), data were collected using the “Tween Day” technique, involving scenario‐based focus groups and interviews with thirty‐four youth in three distinct settings. The study aimed at understanding the situations for which tweens seek everyday information; which sources they use, and why; what social settings foster information‐sharing, and how; and what factors (especially affective) promote or hinder information‐seeking. Using these findings, the proposed professional service framework contains five descriptive principles for mediating everyday‐life information‐seeking and information use by tweens.
Information for the Allies: Office of War Information Libraries in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa	1982	In 1942 the U.S. Office of War Information (OWI) was created by the federal government to increase domestic understanding of America's war effort and to facilitate the flow of American information overseas. As part of this operation, fourteen information libraries were established throughout allied and neutral territory. The OWI librarians sent to Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa arrived in those countries at critical periods in their library development, since all three nations were in the process of reevaluating their library services in the light of recent critical Carnegie Commission reports. By offering strong models of modern information service and by energetically supporting emerging local movements for tax-supported public libraries, three OWI librarians in particular made contributions to library development in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa that endure to this day.
Salary Determination and Occupational Segregation among Librarians	1986	This study identifies the determinants of librarians' salaries and tests human capital-based explanations of librarianship as a women's profession and of intra-occupational segregation by sex within librarianship. Earnings functions are developed for men and women in public and academic libraries and for women in school libraries and are found to be statistically significantly different from one another. Personal, human capital, and job determinants of salaries for each group are identified. The differences in the earnings functions imply different reward structures in the various types of libraries. Salary differences by sex within library type are decomposed and found to be due primarily to differences in individual characteristics, but also to differences in the reward structures for men and women in the same type of library. A major economic theory of occupational segregation, supply-based human capital theory, is examined for its ability to explain the continuing predominance of women in the library profession and, within the profession, the disproportionate representation of men in academic libraries. The results are mixed. Demand-based institutional analysis is suggested as a possible alternative explanation.
Digital Libraries with Embedded Values: Combining Insights from LIS and Science and Technology Studies	2007	In the digital age, libraries are increasingly being augmented or even replaced by information technology (IT), which is often accompanied by implicit assumptions of objectivity and neutrality, yet the field of science and technology studies (STS) has a long history of studying what values are embedded in IT and how they are embedded. This article seeks to unite the strengths of STS and LIS. First, the relevant literature on the values embedded in technologies, IT, physical libraries, and digital libraries is reviewed. Next, empirical and theoretical approaches for studying the values embedded in digital libraries are proposed. Finally, the boundary objects with agency framework is applied to digital libraries as a possible way to address the need for comparative empirical research about what values are embedded in digital libraries, how these values are embedded in digital libraries, and the implications of these embedded values.
Information Anxiety from the Undergraduate Student Perspective: A Pilot Study of Second-semester Freshmen	2014	In early spring 2013, a pilot study was conducted at a major public university in Ohio to explore elements of information anxiety (defined herein as a combination of library anxiety and information technology anxiety) among second-semester freshmen enrolled in all iterations of both a traditional and a remedial first-year English course. The Information Anxiety Scale (an adaptation of Sharon Bostick's 1992 'Library Anxiety Scale') was the pilot study's primary measure. Study researchers wanted to examine which information anxiety elements registered the most statistical significance for respondents. Analysis of results revealed statistically significant findings between elements in the scale and previous research and library experience, sex, and race/ethnicity. This pilot study experience will aid the study's researchers in revising their version of the Information Anxiety Scale for a larger study on information anxiety, toward understanding specific information anxiety triggers for undergraduate students and informing future information literacy instruction practices.
The Bodleian Catalogs of 1674 and 1738: An Examination in the Light of Modern Cataloging Theory	1976	The Bodleian catalogs of 1674 and 1738 had a significant influence upon cataloging practice in their own day and subsequently. The preface to the 1674 catalog and the structure of both catalogs show an awareness of an important question now being raised in modern cataloging theory: the distinction between "book" and "work." The catalogs were also able to fulfill functions later enunciated in the Paris Principles of 1961. Through a complex system of cross-references and ascriptive notes, the catalogs showed themselves attentive to the needs of scholars of the time. We learn much of the way in which decisions were made from a detailed journal kept by a compiler of the 1738 catalog.
An Investigation of Career and Job Satisfaction in Relation to Personality Traits of Information Professionals	2005	This study collected data on personality characteristics, job satisfaction, and career satisfaction from more than 1,300 information professionals. Respondents included academic reference librarians, archivists, catalogers, distance education librarians, public librarians, records managers, school media specialists, special librarians, systems librarians, and other information professionals who responded to listserv requests or picked up questionnaires at a national library conference. Significant correlations were obtained between personality variables and both career and job satisfaction. Stepwise regression analyses were performed, revealing that five variables (Optimism, Emotional Stability, Teamwork, Visionary Work Style, and Work Drive) accounted for 20 percent of the variance in job satisfaction. Four variables accounted for 19 percent of the variance in career satisfaction (Optimism, Work Drive, Emotional Resilience, and Assertiveness). Hierarchical regression analyses were performed to test Lounsbury et al.'s general composite measure of Emotional Resilience, Work Drive, and Optimism as predictors of job and career satisfaction. These variables accounted for 18 percent of the variance in job satisfaction and 19 percent of the variance in career satisfaction. Recommendations for employers to help with hiring and managing information professionals were made.
Public Opinion toward User Fees in Public Libraries	1998	The issue of user fees in public libraries has been debated extensively in the library community in the last several years. Since their origins in the nineteenth century, American public libraries have relied almost exclusively on public funding. An examination of their nature as public goods, however, reveals public library services to be as much private goods as public goods. This conclusion based on economic grounds is supported by surveys of public opinion toward user fees in libraries, which have typically found the general public to be more tolerant of fees than librarians. In this study, we reanalyzed the data from a national telephone poll of 1,181 U.S. residents conducted in 1991 by the Library Research Center at the University of Illinois. When asked what they would like to see done if their local public library were facing a fiscal crisis, 47 percent of those voicing an opinion favored raising taxes, while 44 percent favored instituting user fees. The remaining 9 percent advocated a reduction in services. We used the framework of discrete choice analysis to determine whether attitudes toward fees and taxes stem more from citizens' own self-interest or more from their political outlook. We found greater support for self-interest as an explanation. In particular, more frequent library use, urban residence, a higher level of education, and greater income were all associated with a greater preference for taxes over fees or service cuts.
On Virtual Face-Work: An Ethnography of Communication Approach to a Live Chat Reference Interaction	2011	Erving Goffman's theoretical framework and concept of face-work has the potential to greatly increase the understanding of interpersonal dynamics in computer-mediated communication realms. This research used an ethnography of communication approach and the concept of face-work to analyze the transcript of an interaction between a librarian and a library user in a Web-based virtual reference service environment. This highly goal-oriented interaction, even though it lacks the immediacy of face-to-face interaction, was found to be a rich source of face-work.
The Nature of Relevance in Information Retrieval: An Empirical Study	1993	Experimental research in information retrieval (IR) depends on the idea of relevance. Because of its key role in IR, recent questions about relevance have raised issues of methodological concern and have shaken the philosophical foundations of IR theory development. Despite an existing set of theoretical definitions of this concept, our understanding of relevance from users' perspectives is still limited. Using naturalistic inquiry methodology, this article reports an empirical study of user-based relevance interpretations. A model is presented that reflects the nature of the thought processes of users who are evaluating bibliographic citations produced by a document retrieval system. Three major categories of variables affecting relevance assessments-internal context, external context, and problem context-are identified and described.

Similarities in Circulation Patterns among Public Library Branches Serving Diverse Populations	1995	This article examines the circulation of adult books in public library branches and the distribution of circulation across subject categories for the Indianapolis-Marion County Public Library. As found in many other studies, levels of circulation varied widely among branches and were related to the characteristics of the populations served. The distributions of the subjects of the books circulated did not vary greatly between branches or between groups of branches classified by social and economic characteristics. Both traditional statistical measures and the index of dissimilarity were used to ascertain the degree of differences in circulation patterns among the branches. In only some subject categories were branch circulation levels related to various social and economic characteristics of the populations served.
The Saturday Evening Girls: A Progressive Era Library Club and the Intellectual Life of Working Class and Immigrant Girls in Turn-of-the-Century Boston	2001	Originally established in 1899 to provide intellectual and social stimulation on Saturday evenings to poor, young Jewish and Italian working women and girls living in the North End of Boston, the Saturday Evening Girls' Club successfully expanded into seven additional library clubs over the next twenty years. By the 1910s, the clubs were supporting approximately 250 members, publishing a newspaper called the S.E.G. News, and operating an acclaimed art pottery, the Paul Revere Pottery. Under the tutelage of Edith Guerrier, a librarian, her partner Edith Brown, an artist, and Helen Osborne Storrow, their financial patron, the clubs' meetings focused on weekly discussions of literature, economics, politics, music, art, and employment opportunities. Participation in these clubs enabled some of the members to pursue higher education at a significantly greater rate than their cohort, and indeed even that of native-born white women of the time period. Using rarely available primary documents, I examine the role clubs and social reform organizations played in advancing educational and economic agendas, and provide a rare look at the intellectual life of immigrant and working-class women.
Comparison of the Publishing Patterns between Men and Women Ph.D.s in Librarianship	1988	Previous research examining librarians' publishing patterns has established the significance of published research for personal advancement. Studies have found, however, that in comparison with male librarians, female librarians tend to publish in disproportionately small numbers. One rationale offered for this discrepancy is that men receive the Ph.D. more frequently than do women (doctorate-holding librarians have been isolated as the most prolific writers). This study tests the hypothesis that men and women exhibit similar publishing patterns if education is held constant at the doctoral level. The population studied is limited to a random sample of library science Ph.D.s who received their degrees between 1969 and 1979. A list of each person's publications was compiled for the five-year period following receipt of the Ph.D. The citations are classified by gender, occupation, and type of publication and authorship. On the basis of this study, the hypothesis that men and women will exhibit similar publishing patterns cannot be rejected. The difference in the number of citations per person for equal numbers of men and women is insignificant. Differences between men and women when comparing type of publication, type of authorship, or quality of articles are also insignificant. There is, however, a significant difference between the number of unpublished women and the number of unpublished men; almost three times more women than men have no citations listed in "Library Literature." The hypothesis can be rejected when comparing male and female educators. The difference between mean number of citations per person as well as the difference between nonpublishing male and female educators is highly significant. Male educators publish almost twice as many works as do women. Female educators are almost six times as likely as male educators to have published nothing.
Founding Mothers: The Contribution of Women's Organizations to Public Library Development in the United States	1994	The work of women's voluntary associations in support of free public libraries in the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is examined in this article. This review addresses work at the local level by individual clubs, as well as activities of state federations and of the national coordinating body, the General Federation of Women's Clubs. Activities studied include widespread club support of traveling libraries, clubwomen's work for library legislation, especially to establish state library extension agencies, and local efforts to found libraries. The cooperation of organized women's groups with the American Library Association, state library associations, and state library commissions is explored as well as early support to library education. Findings are placed in the context of library historical writing to suggest that a substantial contribution to American public library development has thus far received insufficient attention.
Speaking out: Analysis of the Experiences and Opinions Reported by Recent Graduates of the University of South Carolina's MLIS Program	2002	This study identifies differences in the experiences of traditional students and distant learners who recently completed the University of South Carolina's Master of Library and Information Science program. Despite the program's emphasis on full student participation and the same instructional experience regardless of distance, this study identifies a number of demographic characteristics that make achieving that goal difficult, if not impossible. Survey respondents offer contrasting opinions of campus-based and televised courses as well as disparate levels of program satisfaction, interaction, resource availability, and early career progress.
The Ethical Presuppositions behind the Library Bill of Rights	2000	The American Library Association's (ALA's) Library Bill of Rights is based on a foundation of ethical presuppositions. In this article, these presuppositions are spelled out and critically examined in light of several ethical theories (for example, utilitarianism, natural rights theory, and social contract theory). We suggest that social contract theory provides the strongest argument for a right to access to information (and to have that information provided by public libraries). We argue, however, that the right to access to information is not unlimited. Limiting access (including censorship) is appropriate, for example, when such a limitation is necessary to protect a more fundamental right. Finally, we argue that the ALA's advocacy of an unlimited right to access is based on a mistaken understanding of what follows from the fact that all of our judgments are fallible.
Producing Storytime: A Collectivist Analysis of Work in a Complex Communicative Space	2007	Storytime programs for young children are ritual events in the everyday life of the public library. This article analyzes data from two such programs to identify and analyze the work carried out by program leaders, their adult and child participants, and other social actors in other settings (e.g., library CEOs) in order to enable the program to happen. The study builds on research on the public library as a physical space and on the library in the life of the user by describing the often invisible literacy, information, and caring work that goes into accomplishing social settings within the physical space of the library. We contend that the work carried out to produce storytime is both discursively bound and value laden and that storytime participants constitute an emerging discourse community whose work coordinates and is simultaneously coordinated by the ongoing creation and maintenance of its discursive boundaries.
Our National Monument of Art: Constructing and Debating the National Body at the Library of Congress	2010	It is not surprising that the Library of Congress would be defined as our national monument of art given the scale of the project, its federal sponsorship, and its posture as a public library with access to all Americans. Paralleling the assumption of the Library of Congress as not merely a building for housing books but a ritualistic center of civilization, the ambitious decorative program celebrated Western civilization and, in particular, the evolution of culture through knowledge. This article examines two mural cycles at the Library of Congress, The Evolution of the Book by John White Alexander and The Evolution of Civilization by Edwin Blashfield, considering each as a multivalent construction of American national identity and the critical debates that they generated. The male body was the subject of both cycles and functioned as the ideological armature within which to project current assumptions of and debates about masculinity, labor, imperialism, social reform, national identity, and progress.
Printing in Nineteenth-Century Belize	1976	After an initial period in which the printing needs of the British settlements in Central America were met from Jamaica, printing was introduced into Belize in 1825. The settlement's first press was unusual in being bought with public funds and controlled by the magistrates. Subsequent printing developments in Belize were closer to the norm for British colonies in the West Indies, with government contractual printing and newspaper publishing forming the mainstay of most printers' businesses in the nineteenth century. Printing for two other former British areas, the Bay Islands and the Mosquito Coast, is also discussed. The article is based on a variety of sources, principally the Belize Archives and the sets of Belize papers preserved in the British Library. Handlists of Belize printers and of Belizean newspapers published in the nineteenth century are included as appendices.
The John M. Wing Foundation on the History of Printing at the Newberry Library	1988	Beginning with its benefactor (John M. Wing, 1844-1917), this article traces the historical development of the John M. Wing Foundation on the History of Printing through the successive contributions of its three custodians (Pierce Butler, 1920-31; Ernst F. Detterer, 1931-47; and James M. Wells, 1951-84). The Wing Foundation contains examples of printing from the invention of movable type in the fifteenth century to the present day, calligraphic manuscripts, archival documents on certain notable type designers and printers, and secondary literature on the history of printing and related interests. The article focuses on the formulation of the collecting policy and the application of the policy in the development of the collection.
Increasing Ethnic Diversity in LIS: Strategies Suggested by Librarians of Color	2008	The proportion of ethnic minorities in the LIS school student population has remained significantly lower than in the U.S. population: in 2002, ethnic minorities constituted only 11.3 percent of the LIS student population, compared to 31.3 percent of the U.S. population. Despite efforts by LIS schools and associations in recruiting and retaining more students of color, the underrepresentation of ethnic minorities continues. This study aimed at assessing what LIS schools and other library and information professional associations have done for the recruitment and retention of students of color and identifying effective strategies for the recruitment and retention from the perspective of librarians of color. A nationwide, Webâ€based survey was conducted to collect input from librarians of color who already have experience with LIS schools and the librarianship. Based on the findings, suggestions were made to improve the recruitment and retention of students of color, which will ultimately contribute to the ethnic/cultural diversity in librarianship.
"Deucedly Independent": A Biographical Overview of the Library Career of Eleanor Weir Welch	1985	Historical analyses of women in the library profession in the United States generally revolve around discussions of those best known to the field: for example, Isadore Mudge, Linda Eastman, and Katharine Sharp. This biographical essay on Eleanor Weir Welch, an Illinois academic librarian most active in the second quarter of this century, broadens our understanding of women in the library profession by examining the career of a lesser-known figure who yet emerges as a librarian of substantial achievement.
Dear Students	2017	This contribution to the special issue is written in the form of a letter addressed to current students in archives. Written in response to the November 2016 election, it considers how the archival profession can navigate issues of racial tension, economic inequality, immigration, and hateful political rhetoric. Archival work is nothing if not critical and cannot be isolated from societal concerns. This letter of personal reflection will consider the interconnections among archives, political issues, and professional practice.
The Convergence of Information Technology, Data, and Management in a Library Imaging Program	2010	Integrating advanced imaging and processing capabilities in libraries, archives, and museums requires effective systems and information management to ensure that the large amounts of digital data about cultural artifacts can be readily acquired, stored, archived, accessed, processed, and linked to other data. The Library of Congress is developing advanced digital imaging capabilities into effective preservation and verification tools as part of a larger scientific preservation study, processing, and research system for implementation by other institutions. An integrated hyperspectral imaging system provides a critical nondestructive tool for research into paper, parchment, photographic, and other objects within the Library and other cultural heritage institutions. This article addresses the implementation of this capability and appropriate metadata standards and the impact on the development and convergence of information architectures and systems in libraries, archives, and museums.
De Vinne and the De Vinne Press	1971	Theodore Low De Vinne (1828-1914), son of a Methodist circuit rider and antislavery pamphleteer, was apprenticed to the printer of the "Newburgh (New York) Gazette" at the age of fourteen. In 1850 he joined the Francis Hart Company in New York City as journeyman compositor and rose to partnership in 1858. Under De Vinne's management, Francis Hart & Company won the contract to print "St. Nicholas" in 1872, followed by "Scribner's Monthly" in 1876 (to become the "Century Illustrated Monthly" in 1881). After the death of Hart, De Vinne purchased the company in 1883 and it became Theodore L. De Vinne and Company until his retirement from direct control in 1908. At this time the company took the corporate name of the De Vinne Press, surviving as such until 1923. De Vinne pioneered in developing typographic style, as a type designer, a historian of printing and printing types, an adapter of new technology to fine printing, and an educator of the printing trade. Making use of contemporary sources and De Vinne's writings and printing, this article examines De Vinne's achievements in various areas, presenting him as the foremost artist and innovator in American printing in the nineteenth century and a major force in the revival of the printing art.
Early Printing and the Book Trade in the West Indies	1978	This paper considers developments in printing prior to 1865 in the British colonies in the Caribbean plus those Dutch, Danish, French, and Swedish colonial possessions which were influenced by the British islands. The reasons for the establishment of presses in these West Indian colonies are examined. Official printing, newspapers, periodicals, and ephemera formed the mainstay of the West Indian printer's business. Though there was some literary publication at the end of the eighteenth century, accompanied by the start of subscription libraries, the decline of the planter class and the weakening of the sugar colonies' economic position prevented indigenous publishing from developing successfully.
Rhizomorphic Reading: The Emergence of a New Aesthetic in Literature for Youth	1999	A new aesthetic in children's literature emerges through the application of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari's six metaphoric principles of the rhizome. This approach to appreciation of children's literature supports the principles of Deleuze and Guattari used to describe human communication and employed as a metaphor for the ideal or rhizome book: connection, heterogeneity, multiplicity, asignifying rupture, cartography, and decalcomania. The associated "rhizomorphic reading" presupposes an active, sense-making reader who understands the significance of establishing connections, appreciating heterogeneity, affirming multiplicity, and validating and reincorporating rupture. After establishing characteristics of the aesthetics associated with two other book forms-the mirror aesthetic with the root-book, and the aesthetic of refabrication with the radicle-system book--we focus on discussion of the new hypertextual aesthetic associated with the rhizome book. Examples of this new aesthetic drawn from contemporary young people's literature follow the theoretical explanations, including relevant hypertext theorists, of each rhizomorphic principle.
Women's Literary Journals	1983	This article reports findings of a questionnaire survey, conducted in spring 1980, of 26 literary magazines edited by and for women. The information gained is discussed in the context of the little-magazine movement as a whole. Women's little magazines, it is discovered, share the independence of purpose, the commitment to encouraging unknown writers, the financial and publishing instability, and the low circulation figures which typify the general run of little magazines. However, they differ in their group styles of editing, their identification with feminism, the preference they give to women as contributors and subjects, and in their emphasizing of social goals over aesthetic concerns.
Considering Popular Fiction and Library Practices of Recommendation: The Literary Status of â€œThe Cliqueâ€ and Its Historical Progenitors	2008	The Clique, a contemporary popular series for girls, has been criticized in the popular and professional media but includes thematic content similar to some of the more lauded midâ€nineteenthâ€century domestic fiction for girls. By making a formal comparison of this popular series with domestic fiction for girls (much of which is now considered â€œclassicâ€ literature), we can establish a tradition in girls' writing more prevalent than perhaps has been thought and can, as we contrast the respective professional receptions of these works, consider how our selection practice is informed by a historically consistent and prescriptive impetus.
Transgression or Stasis? Challenging Foucault in LIS Theory	2007	Michel Foucault (1926â€“84) is a primary thinker informing the construction of a critical theory of library and information science (LIS), or librarianship. He is widely cited and is adapted in various ways that focus on LIS forms of power, discourse, and so on. Others have addressed Foucault's topics, but he remains central. Librarianship has taken up a prior challenge to more fully explore his work, and it is now time to carefully review the implications of Foucault's thinking as a foundation for a criticalâ€theoretical LIS. Foucault has undergone extensive analysis and critique, and this article is a similar step within LIS. While not comprehensive, a review of Foucauldian ideas within LIS literature from a core group of authors is undertaken. Critiques and problems in Foucault's thinking are reviewed since, by relying on Foucault's insights for a line of analysis and research, this LIS theoretical work will reflect some of those same problems.
8-Nov-16	2017	Core values of librarianship are being fundamentally challenged and have been for some time. It is a time for reflection on and clarification of them because how they are understood, communicated, and accomplished in light of November 8, 2016, calls for it. The recent election is just a manifestation of political, social, economic, and cultural shifts under way for some time that brought the disjunctures of how we approach and understand our core values to the surface. Essentially, we are playing out very old tropes in the profession by casting our values as neutral, instrumental, and technocraticâ€”playing directly to the impulses of our neoliberal age and distorting core values.
Information Literacy and Community College Students: Using New Approaches to Literacy Theory to Produce Equity	2009	Librarians in community colleges have engaged in information literacy (IL) for decades, but their theorizing of IL has never taken equity as a starting point. This article asserts that IL theory radiating from equity requires the animating dynamics that conceptual advances in literacy theory offer. By examining early moments in librarianship to understand librarians' relationship to equity and drawing on Jeanâ€Luc Nancy's contrasting notions of globalisation (globalization, resulting in misery) and mondialisation (world forming, resulting in a just society) as a framework for reenvisioning IL, I identify new approaches to IL that are particularly well suited to producing more equitable educational outcomes for community college students. Synthesizing concepts from researchers who have applied new thinking about literacy to their conceptualizations about information literacy, I celebrate approaches to IL in which students, critically engaged in creating meaning, are positioned as producers of information.
Leadership Diversity: A Study of Urban Public Libraries	2007	Diversity has been identified as a priority in library and information services for some time. The limited published research on diversity programs in libraries, though, has focused on academic libraries. This article represents the results of a study of leadership diversity in large, urban public libraries. In the study of members of the Urban Libraries Council, data were gathered with regard to programs related to diversity awareness, staffing, collections, and information services. The research results indicate that diversityâ€related activities and programs have been implemented in a high percentage of the libraries. However, the level of focus on areas such as retention has not been as consistent, as is the case with the provision of library services and collection development, for example. The research results also indicate the relationship between organizational leadership and administrative structure and activities related to operationalizing diversity in public libraries.
