However, the effectiveness of distance education compared to face-to-face delivery has not been thoroughly evaluated. This study compares one graduate-level School Library Media Specialist program delivered both through online and face-to-face instructional delivery methods. We found that, for the most part, the two student cohorts (distance and face-to-face) performed equally in the areas demonstrating content knowledge. However, the online cohort earned fewer points than the face-to-face cohort on some project activities demonstrating the difficulty in relating the intricacies of project work via an online course. This study suggests that the delivery of School Library Media Specialist training can be conducted through an online format if attention is paid to communicating the details of project based work.",A Comparison of Online and Face-to-Face Cohorts in a School Library Media Specialist Graduate Program: A Preliminary Study,Journal of Education for Library and Information Science,2006,10.2307/40323823,article,research-article,jstor,,10/1/2006,4,47,http://www.jstor.org/stable/40323823,Shana Pribesh; Gail K.

Earnings functions are developed for men and women in public and academic libraries and for women in school libraries and are found to be statistically significantly different from one another. Personal, human capital, and job determinants of salaries for each group are identified. The differences in the earnings functions imply different reward structures in the various types of libraries. Salary differences by sex within library type are decomposed and found to be due primarily to differences in individual characteristics, but also to differences in the reward structures for men and women in the same type of library. A major economic theory of occupational segregation, supply-based human capital theory, is examined for its ability to explain the continuing predominance of women in the library profession and, within the profession, the disproportionate representation of men in academic libraries. The results are mixed.

Studies have found, however, that in comparison with male librarians, female librarians tend to publish in disproportionately small numbers. One rationale offered for this discrepancy is that men receive the Ph.D. more frequently than do women (doctorate-holding librarians have been isolated as the most prolific writers). This study tests the hypothesis that men and women exhibit similar publishing patterns if education is held constant at the doctoral level. The population studied is limited to a random sample of library science Ph.D.s who received their degrees between 1969 and 1979. A list of each person's publications was compiled for the five-year period following receipt of the Ph.D. The citations are classified by gender, occupation, and type of publication and authorship. On the basis of this study, the hypothesis that men and women will exhibit similar publishing patterns cannot be rejected. The difference in the number of citations per person for equal numbers of men and women is insignificant. Differences between men and women when comparing type of publication, type of authorship, or quality of articles are also insignificant. There is, however, a significant difference between the number of unpublished women and the number of unpublished men; almost three times more women than men have no citations listed in ""Library Literature."" The hypothesis can be rejected when comparing male and female educators. The difference between mean number of citations per person as well as the difference between nonpublishing male and female educators is highly significant. Male educators publish almost twice as many works as do women. Female educators are almost six times as likely as male educators to have published nothing.",Comparison of the Publishing Patterns between Men and Women Ph.D.s in Librarianship,"The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy",1988,10.2307/4308196,article,research-article,jstor,,1/1/1988,1,58,http://www.jstor.org/stable/4308196,Christine A.

It was found that expenditure response was significantly higher in the first two years of enhancement aid than it had been previously.

Findings offer compelling evidence that strategies employed through Camp Read-a-Rama programming positively impacted childrens attitudes toward reading and their interactions with books, a critical step in literacy skill development and improvement. Analysis of parent/guardian evaluations revealed the following emerging themes as perceived impacts of Camp Read-a-Rama programming upon campers: increased love and enthusiasm for reading, improved reading and listening skills, and a belief that camp activities create a deeper understanding of books and vice versa.

Results reveal three main goals for the preparation of librarians for family and community engagement: (1) to provide librarians with knowledge of families and communities, (2) to promote relationship-building skills, and (3) to encourage the mindset that librarians are professionals.

Further, the era also witnessed suspicion about the way that public spaces were used, particularly by women and girls. Librarians constructed, through arguments that selected titles that represented persuasively pure and feminine ideals, a female sphere in the public library. Images of the early twentieth?century library as a wholesome, protective space for young women acknowledged contemporary social issues and responded to ensure that the bookish domains would be seen as appropriate venues for adolescent girls.",“Why Girls Go Wrong”: Advising Female Teen Readers in the Early Twentieth Century,"The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy",2007,10.1086/519414,article,research-article,jstor,NA,7/1/2007,3,77,http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/519414,Jennifer Burek Pierce,The University of Chicago Press,en,311,326,NA,librarians; reading; library; female; reading guidance; progressive; adolescents; louise; female adolescents; concerns,5747,16,a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202,2000

However, during the trial of Steven Hayes for the Petit family murders, the prosecution questioned the collection development policies of the institutions where Hayes had previously been incarcerated, requesting the reading lists in efforts to prove that his salacious choices in literature fueled his crimes. This request by prosecution brought two major issues into question, including (1) the collection development policies of US prison libraries and (2) the question of patron privacy in prison libraries. This article investigates current prison library policies on collection development and confidentiality of patron borrowing records through an exploratory survey of seventeen librarians currently working in correctional institutions throughout the United States.

They also maintain that a revised Library Bill of Rights needs to rest on a sound philosophical foundation. The foundation they propose is John Rawls' version of social contract theory. I take issue with both claims. Regarding social contract theory, I argue that utilitarianism yields nothing to it regarding the types of materials that libraries should offer and who should have access to those materials. As for the Library Bill of Rights itself, I criticize parts of their interpretation and their positions on censorship, access, and paternalism. My main concern here is with the authors' defense of paternalism in libraries, which would commit them to Internet filtering.

We argue, however, that the right to access to information is not unlimited. Limiting access (including censorship) is appropriate, for example, when such a limitation is necessary to protect a more fundamental right.

This essay attempts to place such arguments in some historical perspective. It suggests that the relative peace that prevailed in the field of children's literature from, roughly, 1900 to 1965 was the result of a broad consensus within the field about the needs of childhood and the function of literature for children. That consensus was, in turn, the result of the general homogeneity of the people involved in the production and purchase of books for children. Agreement broke up in the mid-1960s, when groups heretofore unconcerned with children's books began to see their social and political implications. Enormous changes in the content of children's literature followed with some paradoxical shifts in liberal-conservative positions on censorship.

Under the tutelage of Edith Guerrier, a librarian, her partner Edith Brown, an artist, and Helen Osborne Storrow, their financial patron, the clubs' meetings focused on weekly discussions of literature, economics, politics, music, art, and employment opportunities.

Some historians argue that the frontier forced the pioneers to revert to a near barbaric stage while it divested them of all aspects of their former cultures. Others maintain with equal vigor that the society which developed on each frontier was very nearly a carbon copy of the settled areas further east, and that the culture of Americans had not been significantly altered by the frontier process. Most agree, however, that evidence testifying to the nature and extent of book ownership provides one means of measuring the progress of culture on the frontier. This paper summarizes the results of an intensive study of this topic on the southern Indiana frontier. Data were collected from a variety of sources, but especially important were county probate records, which often contained inventories indicating books owned by early Indiana residents. An examination of over 2,000 inventories located in sixteen southern Indiana counties produced descriptions of more than 500 private libraries. An analysis of these libraries shows that the pattern of book ownership was not startingly different from that revealed by similar studies of book ownership in the American colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Clearly, books were not impossible to acquire in early Indiana, and a sizable proportion of the estates inventoried in the counties studied contained books. Most of the collections were small and narrowly religious in nature, with larger libraries still tending toward the utilitarian. However, a small number of inventories were discovered which listed large numbers of books; a few men--those with both the means and the inclination--built large and well-balanced libraries on the Indiana frontier.","Books on the Frontier: The Extent and Nature of Book Ownership in Southern Indiana, 1800-1850","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy",1972,10.2307/4306206,article,research-article,jstor,,10/1/1972,4,42,http://www.jstor.org/stable/4306206,Michael H.

Virtual communities are unique in making such reading explicit through further acts of writing: participants form their communities through public performances of writing, reading, and interpreting of texts. Any analysis of virtual communities must take into account both the exchange of meaning through texts and the fact of a mediating distance between participants. The hermeneutic theories of Paul Ricoeur can support an analysis of these activities, which accounts for temporal and spatial distance in the exchange of the community's texts.

The preface to the 1674 catalog and the structure of both catalogs show an awareness of an important question now being raised in modern cataloging theory: the distinction between ""book"" and ""work."" The catalogs were also able to fulfill functions later enunciated in the Paris Principles of 1961. Through a complex system of cross-references and ascriptive notes, the catalogs showed themselves attentive to the needs of scholars of the time.

Their responses were compared with U.S. and Canadian government labor-force projections. The results revealed a complex interplay of gender relations in the students' perceptions of the occupational world and their roles within it. The results also revealed an interesting positioning of the job title ""librarian"" relative to other fields. Unlike their assessment of the other occupations included in the study, the students considerably underestimated the level of education required to be a librarian (most did not believe that librarians require a university education). They also underestimated librarians' average starting salary and rated the occupation's social status and future prospects to be lower than the other job titles. Taken together, the results indicate that young people beginning their university studies hold views about career prospects in the information sector that are consistent with some laborforce analysts' views of occupational winners and losers. The students see status, opportunity, and success to be attainable in fields such as computer engineering and systems analysis. Unfortunately, they view the occupational present and future for librarians in a somewhat dimmer light, a worrisome result in view of labor-force data that suggest reasonably strong salary and employment opportunities for this occupation in both the United States and Canada.

Graduate students at a library science program at a North American university were asked, as part of a class assignment, to evaluate PLC recommendations for subject areas in which they had background knowledge. The PLC often makes recommendations that have an imbalance of perspectives (for example, missing theoretical perspectives, overemphasis of a particular facet or theory within a field, missing voices), lack authority, do not have a close match between recommended title and topic area, do not provide a comprehensive framework for the subject area, and are problematic in terms of their usability (for example, lack of balance between scholarly and popular titles, datedness, and format).","The Politics of Standard Selection Guides: The Case of the ""Public Library Catalog""","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy",2003,10.2307/4309664,article,research-article,jstor,,7/1/2003,3,73,http://www.jstor.org/stable/4309664,Juris Dilevko; Lisa Gottlieb,University of Chicago Press,eng,289,337,,student; titles; library; subject; organic gardening; zen buddhism; subject area; rap music; plc recommended; plc list,14983,49,284c5376-5c81-4da3-7f2c-a69053b33c64,2000

As the concentration of media power in the hands of a small number of corporate entities increases and as market-driven management imperatives dominate publishing practices, students should possess the skills to evaluate effectively and critically mass media sources such as main-stream newspapers and magazines. To this end, a theoretical framework for understanding mass media news influence is offered. The concepts of agenda setting, priming, framing, asymmetrical selection, binary oppositionalism, and institutional hegemony are explored in a survey of relevant literature from the fields of journalism and communications. A teaching strategy incorporating these concepts is sketched out. The strategy highlights one news event, and compares how different news sources report that event. Through such an exercise, students will be able to recognize how different news frames affect understanding of the topic in question. Ultimately, the successful BI program will be defined by the extent to which students move away from a passive reading of news media sources to a position where they are able to decode the social context of mainstream news production and develop informed and negotiated reading practices.",Bibliographic Instruction and Mass Media News Literacy: A Theoretical Background,"The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy",1998,10.2307/4309247,article,research-article,jstor,,10/1/1998,4,68,http://www.jstor.org/stable/4309247,Juris Dilevko,University of Chicago Press,eng,431,474,,media news; news literacy; sources; agenda; library quarterly; media news literacy; television; dominance mediation; newspapers; coverage,19971,44,284c5376-5c81-4da3-7f2c-a69053b33c64,1990
