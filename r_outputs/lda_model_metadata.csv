This study was conducted to assess whether student participation complemented or expanded the knowledge and skills gained from the MLIS core through application in an external setting. The knowledge and skills acquired by the students are intended to raise consciousness of critical literacy issues that will enable students to participate in community engagement beyond their MLIS program. Through this study, the authors evaluate a project framework designed to connect student experiences in a training-based project with the core areas of the MLIS curriculum. Preliminary analysis demonstrates potential for the framework to serve as a practical generalization for developing similar basic technology literacy projects that can complement what is taught in other MLIS programs.","A Service-Learning Framework to Support an MLIS Core Curriculum","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","2011","10.2307/41308890","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2011-04-01,"2",52,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41308890","Dan Albertson; Maryann S.

The high-level implications of this problem indicate the need to adopt inclusive principles that require usability beyond accessibility for all user groups in library web design. To meet this goal, we propose an inclusive information architecture specifically focused on screen-reader access.

Limits to any legal speech are viewed as potential encroachments on First Amendment rights. The profession of librarianship has formally embraced and defended a strict interpretation of the First Amendment in The Freedom to Read Statement and in court. However, individual librarians and scholars of law are not unanimous in defending hate speech. This article offers a rhetorical analysis of the defense of hate speech in these fields in order to illustrate a paradox: speech that intimidates is designed to silence others' voices. Good speech does not necessarily offer an antidote to bad speech when bad speech is loud and spoken often. The consequences of allowing all speech in public forums should be regularly evaluated so public spaces remain places where everyone is free to enter and be heard without fear.","What We Talk about When We Talk about Free Speech","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2015","10.1086/679024","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2015-01-01,"1",85,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/679024","Jenny S.

Three motivations emerged: accommodation, predisposition, and selectivity, which influenced the respondents to choose online learning. The prevalent issues online MLIS students experienced were a sense of isolation from peers and instructors, and a lack of professional development and networking opportunities with peers.

Interviews were conducted with 11 library educators at leading schools of information and library sciences within the United States to understand their perspectives on the topics. Results reveal three main goals for the preparation of librarians for family and community engagement: (1) to provide librarians with knowledge of families and communities, (2) to promote relationship-building skills, and (3) to encourage the mindset that librarians are professionals. Experiential and connected learning opportunities are the most promising methods for achieving these outcomes. Findings are discussed in terms of four main recommendations for stronger integration of family and community engagement into existing curriculum.","Preparing the Next Generation of Librarians for Family and Community Engagement","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","2018","10.2307/90025869","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2018-10-01,"4",59,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/90025869","Margaret Caspe; M.

Data were collected in spring 2007 through interviews with nine library administrators and staff, and surveys with twenty-six older adult patrons at the three libraries. Approximately eight hours of observation were also conducted to gather contextual data to supplement the interview and survey data. The seven guidelines laid out by the American Library Association (1999) were used to guide the design of data collection instruments and the analysis of data. One key finding is that these libraries offer few programs and services geared to healthy and active older adults, thus leaving much room for improvement in the future. Interestingly, the libraries still received high praise from the older adult participants, a phenomenon that requires further examination. A number of recommendations are offered to help public libraries to better serve the aging population in their communities.","Services to Older Adults: Preliminary Findings from Three Maryland Public Libraries","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","2009","10.2307/40732568","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2009-04-01,"2",50,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40732568","David Piper; Serenity Palmer; Bo Xie","Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE)","eng","107","118",NA,"older adults; public libraries; libraries; library; adult patrons; services; older adult patrons; adult participants; ala guidelines; older adult participants",6403,12,"284c5376-5c81-4da3-7f2c-a69053b33c64",2000

Librarians traditionally hail from the humanities, especially English and history. But as current educational attention shifts to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, are librarians reflecting this change? Anonymized data from ALA-accredited graduate programs from the last five years were collected, coded, and classified to determine librarians' educational and disciplinary backgrounds and in what ways, if any, they differ from the past 65 years and from the contemporary US general population. Unsurprisingly, we found that contemporary librarians still hail predominantly from English and history‚Äîa stark contrast from the business and health undergraduate degrees earned by the general US population. Backgrounds in STEM fields remain lacking in librarianship, but librarians with undergraduate education in the arts are on the rise, perhaps supporting the creativity, flexibility, innovation, and risk taking necessary in twenty-first-century libraries.","The More Things Change, the More They Stay the Same","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","2018","10.2307/90025870","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2018-10-01,"4",59,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/90025870","Rachel Ivy Clarke; Young-In Kim","Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE)","eng","179","205",NA,"social sciences; librarians; librarianship; undergraduate; humanities; professions; degrees; education; library; professions business",9711,27,"284c5376-5c81-4da3-7f2c-a69053b33c64",2010

The aim of this essay is to develop conceptual strategies that will contribute to the operationalization of a multicultural curriculum. To provide that framework, the discussions draw upon concepts and literature from a variety of research fields that deal with the role of culture in human cognitive processes and informational behaviors.

The purpose of the study is to determine the nature and extent of interest in children's books in the formative period of the ""golden age of children's literature."" Which periodicals covered children's books, and how did their cultural discourse, as revealed through reviewing and commentary, shape the norms and assumptions by which children's books were created and evaluated? Seventy-five literary periodicals were studied for their coverage of children's books in this period. The literary periodicals are drawn from Poole's Index, Nineteenth-Century Readers' Guide, and Wellesley Index. Using reception theory, a branch of reader-response criticism, I construct the contemporary context in which children's books were received-expressed as ""horizons of expectations."" A spectrum of cultural discourse included the following horizons: the treatment of children's books as a commodity; the elevation of children's books as works of art; an emphasis on illustration and pictorial effects in literature; a lack of rigid demarcation between adult and children's literature; a growing gender division; a diversification of the didactic tradition; a continuing debate on fantasy and realism; the romantic idealization of childhood and its literature; attention to the historiography of children's literature; and anxiety about the changing character of children's reading. While these concerns informed the larger history of children's literature, they converged in late Victorian England and America to create a unique climate for the reception of children's books as a body of literature, a field of study, and a form of expressive culture.","Victorian Horizons: The Reception of Children's Books in England and America, 1880-1900","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1994","10.2307/4308896","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1994-01-01,"1",64,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4308896","Anne H.

Results show positive gains for both LIS students and the collaborating community agencies. LIS students gained an understanding of collection development variables at work in particular community-based information organizations. Community representatives reported that partnering with students made a positive difference in their agency owing to students' practical and timely choices, levels of knowledge and range of selections, and their consideration of financial and strategic factors relevant to the community. In a professional school, learning in community engagement activities places students in the field where they encounter challenges that make LIS work stimulating and fruitful. Additional examples of how to make community engagement a more effective part of the LIS curriculum are needed.

Research methods involved a content analysis of bibliographic course descriptions available on the homepages of graduate programs in Canada and the United States that are accredited by the American Library Association. Syllabi for LIS courses on health information support services, gender, and sexual orientation were also studied. Findings map the existing infoscape surrounding the teaching of health information support services in LIS and identify future directions for inclusion of gender and sexual orientation topics in the LIS curriculum.","Mapping the Infoscape of LIS Courses for Intersections of Health-Gender and Health-Sexual Orientation Topics","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","2014","10.2307/43686983","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2014-07-01,"3",55,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/43686983","Bharat Mehra; William Travis Tidwell","Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE)","eng","191","211",NA,"sexual orientation; health; gender; health gender; courses; orientation topics; lis courses; university; health sexual; health sciences",10333,21,"5ba600e5-1e80-4ff3-edf9-458ad76b1059",2010

This project has pointed out the trouble with classification and cataloging decisions that are framed as objective and neutral but are always ideological and worked to correct bias in library structures. Viewing knowledge organization systems from a queer perspective, however, challenges the idea that classification and subject language can ever be finally corrected. Engaging queer theory and library classification and cataloging together requires new ways of thinking about how to be ethically and politically engaged on behalf of marginal knowledge formations and identities who quite reasonably expect to be able to locate themselves in the library. Queer theory invites a shift in responsibility from catalogers, positioned to offer functional solutions, to public services librarians, who can teach patrons to dialogically engage the catalog as a complex and biased text, just as critical catalogers do.","Queering the Catalog: Queer Theory and the Politics of Correction","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2013","10.1086/669547","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2013-04-01,"2",83,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/669547","Emily Drabinski","The University of Chicago Press","en","94","111",NA,"cataloging; classification; classification and cataloging; library; library classification; headings; lesbian; queer theory; subject; knowledge organization",7487,18,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",2010

Special emphasis is given to the empowering professions (such as psychology, social work, education, and librarianship), which all share the goal of enabling their clients to use knowledge for the purpose of taking control of their own lives. After offering a critique of the unquestioned assumptions and androcentric biases underlying modern theories of professionalization, this article presents a feminist perspective that validates the ethic of care in professional practice and acknowledges the importance of those professional activities whose goal is to diffuse knowledge, not to guard or control it.","Toward a New Model of the Information Professions: Embracing Empowerment","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","1997","10.2307/40324190","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1997-10-01,"4",38,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40324190","Mary Niles Maack","Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE)","eng","283","302",NA,"professions; empowerment; clients; professional; social work; social; librarianship; knowledge; librarians; library",10924,20,"5ba600e5-1e80-4ff3-edf9-458ad76b1059",1990

Both theme concepts have ramifications for LIS education. Librarianship and teaching are both professions that resist commodification because they rely on embodied labor and personal interaction. Competition, as a management or learning style, may not promote meaningful innovation in LIS education, and instead risks creating a climate that is hostile to its chief demographic. The feminization of LIS can be seen as a strength insofar as it promotes the relative parity in numbers of men and women full-time faculty. LIS education should build on this strength in its innovation practices, enabling friendly encounters between technologies, and men and women alike.","Gendered Narratives of Innovation Through Competition: Lessons From Science and Technology Studies","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","2013","10.2307/43686928","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2013-01-01,"1",54,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/43686928","Scout Calvert","Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE)","eng","3","14",NA,"innovation; competition; technologies; science; education; lis education; library; technological determinism; technology studies; gendered",7132,12,"5ba600e5-1e80-4ff3-edf9-458ad76b1059",2010

To understand how users interact with products, usability analysts employ methods from task analyses and rapid prototyping in informal settings to talk-aloud protocols in specially equipped usability laboratories. For example, OCLC and Lexis-Nexis have maintained usability laboratories for several years to assist in the design of their software products. The application of the usability approach for research in information studies and to support library and information center purchase and implementation decisions holds much promise. This work presents an overview of the major methods of usability analysis and indicates how they can be used efficiently and effectively by information professionals in real work environments to improve selection and deployment of hardware, software, and information products.

Writings on goal conflict within organizations suggest that the two groups characteristically involved in a large library's book selection process, the coordinators and branch librarians, would display differing orientations toward the process which would result in conflicting objectives and organizational tensions. A case study using nonparticipant observation, interviews, and a questionnaire survey was carried out to examine this hypothesis. The findings challenge the traditional view of forces guiding book selection in a children's library.","The Impact of Differing Orientations of Librarians on the Process of Children's Book Selection: A Case Study of Library Tensions","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1978","10.2307/4306968","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1978-07-01,"3",48,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4306968","Joseph Turow","University of Chicago Press","eng","276","292",NA,"librarians; branch librarians; selection; book selection; library; coordinators; branch personnel; titles; childrens book; childrens",7227,17,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",1970

A mail survey and interviews were used to assess the effects of an academic boycott on South African academics. The mail survey included categorical and open-ended questions that measured reports of direct experiences of the boycott tactics as effects of the boycott. The open-ended questions indicated themes of effect of the boycott for further exploration through focused interviews. Focused interviews were used to provide depth and specificity of the effects through the personal accounts of a subsample of respondents. Analysis of the data supported the value of looking at effects of the boycott in different ways. The quantitative survey data indicated that 57.3 percent of the respondents claimed a direct experience of one or more boycott tactics, while the qualitative data derived from interviews revealed significant psychological effects on South African academics.","Combining Qualitative and Quantitative Methodologies to Study the Effects of an Academic Boycott on Academics in South Africa","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1993","10.2307/4308869","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1993-10-01,"4",63,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4308869","Lorraine J.

The children's collections in Louisville's and Nashville's black branch libraries held many of the same books available in other public libraries, and some of those books included demeaning characterizations and images of African Americans. Branch librarians mediated between the children and the collections, creating services, such as story hours and reading clubs, that supported interpretive communities of young African American readers.","Books for Black Children: Public Library Collections in Louisville and Nashville, 1915-1925","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2000","10.2307/40039741","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2000-04-01,"2",70,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039741","Cheryl Knott Malone","University of Chicago Press","eng","179","200",NA,"library; uncle remus; nashville; public library; african; louisville; librarians; children; harris; louisville free",9466,22,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",2000

While studyabroad courses have long been a part of undergraduate and graduate education in North America, few opportunities exist for students in LIS. This paper argues for their continued offering as well as for the creation of new study-abroad courses in LIS. The simple reason is that global study programs help students understand the interconnectedness and inter-dependence of the world (Smith, Hallam, & Ghosh, 2012). They expose students to other practices in the information professions and create opportunities for library science programs to tap into new markets for recruitment. They also foster critical thinking on a range of issues including, but not limited to, race, ethnicity, and gender. A study-abroad program will serve as a model for discussing these factors as well as pedagogy, strategies for student learning, and cross-classroom collaboration.","Crossing the Globe","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","2018","10.2307/90023022","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2018-07-01,"3",59,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/90023022","Renate L.

A conceptual model is provided that describes the outcome of challenges to materials in terms of retention, restriction, and removal. The model was derived from research findings in library and information science, educational administration, behavioral science, and communications and suggests that the path from the challenge to the outcome is complex. The model contains several classes of variables, including district materials selection policy; school environment; community environment; and initiator of challenge. Variable classes of special interest in the present study are the characteristics of the librarian, which emphasize the psychological factors of locus of control and dogmatism, and complaint background, which focuses on whether the complaint was oral or written and whether there was active support for the retention or the removal of materials. The validity of the model was tested using survey research methods with a national sample of school librarians reporting challenges to materials. The results were found generally to support the model.","A Conceptual Model of Factors Influencing the Outcome of Challenges to Library Materials in Secondary School Settings","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1993","10.2307/4308772","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1993-01-01,"1",63,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4308772","Dianne McAfee Hopkins","University of Chicago Press","eng","40","72",NA,"librarians; library; retention; outcome; school; challenges; library materials; dogmatism; standardized residual; censorship",10286,33,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",1990

A secondary result of this study is that it shows the value of intraoccupational studies like this one for a full understanding of labor market segmentation.

Other constraints include the redivision of Nigeria into smaller internal units; lack of professional leadership, government legislation, backing, and financial support in certain states; staffing problems; and the difficulty of extending service outside the urban areas.","Constraints on the Development of Public Library Service in Nigeria","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1985","10.2307/4307895","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1985-10-01,"4",55,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4307895","Anthony Olden","University of Chicago Press","eng","398","423",NA,"library; nigeria; public library; public libraries; library service; kaduna; librarians; bendel; librarian; library development",12108,26,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",1980

What we know, and what we allow ourselves to know, about libraries and their users is conditioned by history and politics. The work of Antonio Gramsci can help us to understand this situation. Librarians and scholars of LIS occupy a space that is contested terrain in a war of position between the hegemony of the capitalist historic bloc and the subjects who would challenge that bloc to be true to its self-declared principles of democratic participation. Gramsci's insights regarding the nature of capitalist social formations, and the role of intellectuals organic to these formations, reveal the ambivalent social position of LIS as a source of both support and resistance to capitalist hegemony.","Librarians as Organic Intellectuals: A Gramscian Approach to Blind Spots and Tunnel Vision","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2003","10.2307/4309619","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2003-01-01,"1",73,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4309619","Douglas Raber","University of Chicago Press","eng","33","53",NA,"historic bloc; hegemony; capitalist; gramsci; intellectuals; librarians; organic intellectuals; library; social formations; tunnel vision",9455,21,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",2000

Finally, we offer recommendations for how to further make visible and shift the hegemonic landscape in LIS toward an inclusivity that actively deals with how race, gender, class, and sexuality deeply informs our profession.","Changing Course: Collaborative Reflections of Teaching/Taking ""Race, Gender, and Sexuality in the Information Professions""","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","2014","10.2307/43686984","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2014-07-01,"3",55,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/43686984","Safiya U.

Discussion of the two main types of ethical theory, utilitarianism and deontology, is next. Then the deontological position on intellectual freedom is presented in the context of its theory of rights. The discussion of deontology is followed by a utilitarian criticism of the deontological defense of intellectual freedom. Then a utilitarian defense of intellectual freedom is offered and applied to libraries. The article concludes by arguing that, even though in theory utilitarianism would countenance some censorship, in practice the utilitarian will support complete intellectual freedom. It is maintained that libraries have a special role to play in promoting unconditional intellectual freedom.","A Utilitarian Case for Intellectual Freedom in Libraries","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2001","10.2307/4309485","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2001-01-01,"1",71,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4309485","Tony Doyle","University of Chicago Press","eng","44","71",NA,"intellectual freedom; utilitarian; censorship; rights; librarians; pornography; libraries; deontological; library; net happiness",13345,28,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",2000

The study on equity has three objectives: (1) to provide a brief introduction to the LIS education programs and the institutions which offer those programs in Sri Lanka; (2) to analyze critically the equity of the LIS programs; and (3) to make recommendations for improvement. Four principal methods were used to collect the data required for the main research; semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, review of relevant documents, and participatory observations by the researcher. Four criteria, namely gender, income, geographic region and language, were used to analyze the equity of LIS education programs. Findings of the study established that there is a gender imbalance in the LIS programs with 80% to 90% female students, that an income inequity is evident, that there is a severe inequity in the regional distribution and language of the programs. The paper makes several recommendations to reduce these inequities and makes suggestions for further research.","A Critical Analysis of the Equity of LIS Education Programs in Sri Lanka","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","2008","10.2307/40323754","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2008-10-01,"4",49,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40323754","Pradeepa Wijetunge","Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE)","eng","243","263",NA,"sri lanka; lis education; programs; equity; education programs; lis programs; lis education programs; library; students; income",8805,21,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",2000

In a collaborative effort between an academic researcher and a rural public library director in North Carolina, pedometers and an individualized online health self-assessment program were made available to library users. The activities were adopted enthusiastically. Feedback included encouragement for more such opportunities; some claimed the activities improved awareness and supported healthy behavior change. With minimal investment, rural public libraries can support healthy lifestyle activities. They also afford a unique environment where library staff can collaborate with researchers to introduce, assess and evaluate community health initiatives.

For generations, the Library and Information Studies (LIS) community has devoted most of its attention to the first, but currently it is poorly positioned to undertake research on the second and third. American Studies, on the other hand, is well placed to address the second and third, but has largely overlooked American public, school, and academic libraries as subjects of study.

For the most part, however, the library and information science (LIS) research community has failed to analyze the deeper meanings of these appropriations or to evaluate their significance for library users, in large part because it has yet to harness the ideas of many critical theorists whose thinking now dominates so much of the discourse occurring in other professions and academic disciplines. This article constitutes a reexamination of the twentieth-century history of American librarianship that is grounded on this thinking. It argues that contemporary LIS discourse is plagued with tunnel vision and blind spots that greatly limit the profession's ability to understand the role of the American library in the present accurately, and thus seriously affect the profession's efforts to plan the library's future.","Tunnel Vision and Blind Spots: What the past Tells Us about the Present; Reflections on the Twentieth-Century History of American Librarianship","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1999","10.2307/4309267","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1999-01-01,"1",69,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4309267","Wayne A.

They are as follows: to (1) explore the historical dimension of library topics, (2) revive study of the institution of the library in its historical dimension, and (3) orient research to lead adaptation to the times, particularly with regard to the relationships between libraries and other components of the information domain. Examples of opportunities and insights to be gained from study of topics in these agendas are drawn from the experience of exploring the history of the state library and archives of Texas.","Is There Counsel in Those Curtains?

Design characteristics of this program that has maintained a retention rate of over 90 percent over five years are described and mapped to the literature on distance education published after its implementation. The paper reports that characteristics identified in the practical and theoretical literatures are the same as, or closely related to, the characteristics of the program described. Student transcripts were used to track retention and time-to-completion. Topics for continuing study are identified and described.

They attempted to construct librarianship in the United States as an equivalent profession to the other white, masculine professions of their day. They also created education for librarianship in the same mold. They subscribed to, and employed, the traditional white Western masculine definition of profession as one of expertise derived from education based on science. They also employed the control of knowledge and its application as exemplified by the type of professional education they promoted. Their efforts were not restricted to education but also included active discrimination against female librarians in the Library War Service during the First World War. This paper presents a new perspective on the meaning of ‚Äúprofession‚Äù which recognizes it as situated at the intersection of gender, race, and nationality and explores the implications for modern education for librarianship.","The Work Calls for Men","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","2016","10.2307/90015233","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2016-10-01,"4",57,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/90015233","Suzanne M.

In 2009, youth, ages 13-29, accounted for 39% of all new HIV infections in the U.S. (Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 2011). South Carolina ranks eighth in the nation for new HIV cases, while the capital city of Columbia ranks seventh (Carolina Teen Health, 2012). Education and prevention efforts are needed to raise young adults' awareness of HIV/AIDS issues in order to reduce this troubling trend. To address this need, the researchers and a graphic illustrator worked with incarcerated students age 15-19 in the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice School District, to develop an age-appropriate, culturally-diverse graphic novel on HIV/AIDS, entitled AIDS in the End Zone. Phase I of the project was to create the novel. Once Phase I was completed, Phase II of the project began. During this phase, graphic novel book club interventions were held with young adults in public libraries in Columbia, South Carolina to measure knowledge gains and impact from reading the graphic novel. The purpose of this phase was to examine the role that graphic novels can play as a resource for increasing HIV/AIDS awareness among young adults. Phase II was funded by the 2013 ALISE Research Grant. The findings of the study are reported here. This study is the first of its kind to provide scientifically-based research that examines whether or not graphic novels can be an effective HIV/AIDS prevention tool for young adults. Implications for LIS education are discussed.","Information Vaccine: Using Graphic Novels as an HIV/AIDS Prevention Resource for Young Adults","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","2014","10.2307/43686979","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2014-04-01,"2",55,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/43686979","Kendra S.

One's place within a community is also constituted by an ongoing metaphoric ""reading"" through which one attempts to understand what others within the community say and do. Virtual communities are unique in making such reading explicit through further acts of writing: participants form their communities through public performances of writing, reading, and interpreting of texts. Any analysis of virtual communities must take into account both the exchange of meaning through texts and the fact of a mediating distance between participants. The hermeneutic theories of Paul Ricoeur can support an analysis of these activities, which accounts for temporal and spatial distance in the exchange of the community's texts. Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory can be used to describe the process that drives virtual communities, which makes them into forums that attempt to ""connect the scattered members of an invisible republic"" [1, p. 43] in an electronic world.","The Scattered Members of an Invisible Republic: Virtual Communities and Paul Ricoeur's Hermeneutics","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2002","10.2307/4309598","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2002-04-01,"2",72,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4309598","Gary Burnett","University of Chicago Press","eng","155","178",NA,"virtual communities; community; ricoeur; hermeneutics; ricoeurs; discourse; interlocution; mediated; library quarterly; textual",10664,24,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",2000

Four categories of censorship emerge: prior censorship and suspension of publication; restraints upon information gathering; the suppression of anti-apartheid viewpoints; and the growth of militarization. The State of Emergency is seen as a microcosm of the system as a whole, and a comparison is made with ""traditional"" censorship of books. Emergency censorship is considered to be a radical tactical change whose impact on library resources and research in the humanities and social sciences is evaluated. In spite of the power and pervasiveness of the censorship system, it is concluded that there is still room for challenge and that a new breed of librarian is likely to play an important role in the process.","In a State of Emergency: Libraries and Government Control in South Africa","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1990","10.2307/4308429","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1990-01-01,"1",60,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4308429","Christopher Merrett","University of Chicago Press","eng","1","22",NA,"censorship; emergency; african; weekly mail; apartheid; security; banned; library quarterly; emergency regulations; libraries",9799,22,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",1990

The historic context depicts the milieu in which young women and the advisors who sought to guide them lived and read as a time of intense concern with adolescent female sexual activity. Further, the era also witnessed suspicion about the way that public spaces were used, particularly by women and girls. Librarians constructed, through arguments that selected titles that represented persuasively pure and feminine ideals, a female sphere in the public library. Images of the early twentieth?century library as a wholesome, protective space for young women acknowledged contemporary social issues and responded to ensure that the bookish domains would be seen as appropriate venues for adolescent girls.","‚ÄúWhy Girls Go Wrong‚Äù: Advising Female Teen Readers in the Early Twentieth Century","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2007","10.1086/519414","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2007-07-01,"3",77,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/519414","Jennifer¬†Burek Pierce","The University of Chicago Press","en","311","326",NA,"librarians; reading; library; female; reading guidance; progressive; adolescents; louise; female adolescents; concerns",5747,16,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",2000

The Enlarged Program was a major initiative to revitalize library services and to establish ALA as the dominant force in library affairs. Among the proposals were continuation of selected war-related services, closer liaison with other professional groups, new programs of service for adults and immigrants, promotion of library extension, certification of professional education, and constitutional revision. To achieve these objectives, a $2 million fund drive was authorized. Despite the best of intentions, the Enlarged Program turned into ALA's most humiliating defeat until that time.

However, during the trial of Steven Hayes for the Petit family murders, the prosecution questioned the collection development policies of the institutions where Hayes had previously been incarcerated, requesting the reading lists in efforts to prove that his salacious choices in literature fueled his crimes. This request by prosecution brought two major issues into question, including (1) the collection development policies of US prison libraries and (2) the question of patron privacy in prison libraries. This article investigates current prison library policies on collection development and confidentiality of patron borrowing records through an exploratory survey of seventeen librarians currently working in correctional institutions throughout the United States. Their responses detail collection development policies in the prison library and present the ambiguity for handling the confidentiality of patron borrowing records.","Collection Development and Circulation Policies in Prison Libraries: An Exploratory Survey of Librarians in US Correctional Institutions","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2012","10.1086/667435","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2012-10-01,"4",82,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/667435","Suzanna Conrad","The University of Chicago Press","en","407","427",NA,"prison; library; prison libraries; correctional; correctional institutions; records; patron borrowing; borrowing records; intellectual freedom; circulation records",6622,21,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",2010

The purpose is to illustrate how technology developments do not occur independently of their social context but rather are co‚Äêconstituted by the interaction between the various players involved. Interviews with library policy makers and project managers were conducted between 1999 and 2002. The key question investigated is how much of the development of a national union catalog is influenced by choices that are not solely technical but that include players' differing visions, the solutions that they feel they need to adopt, the difficulties they may encounter, and their cultural practices. Findings show that the variety of coalitions and their respective visions and choices have an impact on the conception and design of a national union catalog. The case studies also raise broader issues of technology diffusion, local knowledge, cultural practices, and national identity.","The Politics of Library Artifacts: The National<br/>Union Catalog","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2004","10.1086/422776","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2004-07-01,"3",74,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/422776","Nadia Caidi","The University of Chicago Press","en","337","369",NA,"union catalog; libraries; catalogs; caslin; czech republic; countries; national union; national library; respondents; national",11247,33,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",2000

Despite the tremendous interest surrounding young people and STEM education, the role of school libraries in these initiatives is rarely examined. In this article, we outline a sociocultural approach to explore how school library programs can play a critical role in STEM education and articulate the need for research that examines the contributions of school libraries as potential hybrid spaces for STEM learning. We propose that school library programs become active participants in STEM learning through the specific roles that school librarians currently play in schools, such as information specialist, instructional partner, and technology ally. We also highlight how these roles can be tailored toward helping young people develop STEM identities.","Reimagining the Role of School Libraries in STEM Education: Creating Hybrid Spaces for Exploration","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2012","10.1086/664578","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2012-04-01,"2",82,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/664578","Mega M.

With this background in place, an analysis of how publics now approach libraries is possible‚Äîand clarifies library responses within our current neoliberal environment.","The Library in the Life of the Public","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2017","10.2307/26561704","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2017-01-01,"1",87,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/26561704","John Buschman","The University of Chicago Press","eng","55","70",NA,"public; libraries; buschman; neoliberal; neoliberalism; political; wiegand; buschman john; social; democracy",8298,16,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",2010

In the first two years of enhancement aid, total state aid received by Pennsylvania libraries more than doubled. This reversed the trend of little growth in the years preceding 2000. The enhancement aid program also redesigned certain categories of state aid to increase incentives for local government support. Based on the principles from the economics of grants literature, an empirical model was employed to test the effect of state aid on library expenditures in Pennsylvania counties. Grant response was estimated by employing two separate equations in which library expenditures and state aid were simultaneously determined. It was found that expenditure response was significantly higher in the first two years of enhancement aid than it had been previously. Further, state aid stimulated increased local revenue financing in most years and in most counties. However, the degree of stimulation decreased in many counties during the enhancement period, thus providing them with tax relief.","Does State Aid Stimulate Public Library Expenditures?

LCSH frequently fails to combine unrelated subjects into a single heading, while subject statements in PRECIS are sometimes so long that significant aspects of the work cannot be adequately integrated.

As for the Library Bill of Rights itself, I criticize parts of their interpretation and their positions on censorship, access, and paternalism.

This organization, the first of its kind in the United States, promoted independence, patriotism, and self-sufficiency among young girls. This article's focus on the Girl Scout handbooks and the additional periodical literature produced by the organization provides important clues as to the kind of advice Low felt necessary to impart to these girls and the types of activities the organization promoted. Girl Scout handbooks and magazines provide insight into the degree to which the Girl Scout organization (1) promoted feminist ideology to young girls in the early 1900s, (2) expected a woman's sphere to be restricted to the realm of children, religion, and the home, and (3) encouraged women to display independence either surreptitiously or overtly. The Girl Scout handbooks lend insight into the evolving definition of gender roles through the instruction they imparted to young girls. The intended goals of the Girl Scouts, through a study of the Girl Scout literature, will help elucidate the expectations grown women, like Juliette Low, maintained for their youthful counterparts.","American Girlhood in the Early Twentieth Century: The Ideology of Girl Scout Literature, 1913-1930","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1998","10.2307/4309227","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1998-07-01,"3",68,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4309227","Rebekah E.

The interview contained 25 questions relating to current reading habits, library use during the previous year, and childhood experiences related to reading and library use for the respondent and the respondent's parents. In addition, demographic data were obtained for the respondents. On the basis of usable responses obtained from 342 persons (95 percent of the persons interviewed), it was determined that heavy library users and readers were not unlike those characterized by earlier studies. A substantial number of childhood variables did prove to have statistical relationships with reading and library use. The results clearly indicated the importance of social learning and parents as primary agents in the development of reading and library habits.","Childhood Socialization: Its Effect on Adult Library Use and Adult Reading","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1984","10.2307/4307745","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1984-07-01,"3",54,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4307745","Ronald R.

Interest in the health literacy movement has waxed and waned, often dependent on political agendas. In an era of increasing health care costs, it is not surprising that health literacy is once again at the forefront, given that economists and policy makers currently estimate the cost of limited health literacy in the United States to be between $1.6 to $3.6 trillion annually. Health literacy has been recognized as an issue key to the success of health care reform and to the continued advancement of the nation's status as an international leader where health and well-being are concerned.

All are examples of freedom of choice expressed through action and mirror a growing societal determination to exert control over important areas of one's life. The provision of consumer health information is a necessary support mechanism for that portion of health care focused on investing in risk reduction and shared decision making. As changes in the U.S. health-care system occur over time, access to CHI is likely to remain prominent and increasingly important to the ordinary person.

While many perceive gaming as a new library service, gaming services have been part of librarianship since the nineteenth century through chess clubs. During the Great Depression, libraries supported patrons with puzzle contests and developed circulating toy and game collections. Academic libraries built game collections for research and classroom needs, while school libraries collected and facilitated educational games to aid teachers. Video games have been used in libraries to help patrons learn to use technology and to bring groups of patrons together to enjoy shared experiences. The goal of this article is to demonstrate the different ways in which libraries have used games, toys, and puzzles over the last 150 years through both collections and services.","Playing in the Past: A History of Games, Toys, and Puzzles in North American Libraries","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2013","10.1086/671913","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2013-10-01,"4",83,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/671913","Scott Nicholson","The University of Chicago Press","en","341","361",NA,"libraries; gaming; gaming programs; public library; public libraries; collections; toy libraries; patrons; library services; academic libraries",8294,21,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",2010

The purpose of the assessment will vary according to the perspective of the library under examination. Paths for approaching such assessment include consideration of the assessment's purpose, types of questions posed by it, data-gathering methodologies, and reporting strategies of results. These paths are useful to gain insights into the evolving role of the library and its contribution to the academic enterprise.

A study of twenty American historians was conducted in order to better understand the nature of research in history. Respondents were asked about their choice of research topics, specific projects in progress, use of archives, categorization of materials collected, writing habits, and use of computers. Interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using standard, qualitative techniques. The results are discussed in the light of previous investigations of historians and the published statements of classification experts regarding the organization of historical knowledge. Suggestions for future study of historians are offered, and implications for libraries are explored.","The Collection and Use of Information by Some American Historians: A Study of Motives and Methods","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1991","10.2307/4308543","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1991-01-01,"1",61,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4308543","Donald Owen Case","University of Chicago Press","eng","61","82",NA,"historians; history; library quarterly; library; respondents; historical; research; classification; categories; social sciences",9943,22,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",1990

Every place maker must make do, make sense, and make place in an environment that is technologically heterogeneous and in which the potential for novelty as well as recurrence is a persistent feature. The siege flag of place has been raised, not only in librarianship but in many sectors, in defense of the human and the parochial, of tradition and local turf. Taking a phenomenological cue, here we attempt to prune and redirect this problematic term. We arrive at what we consider reasonable criteria of success for ourselves: to what extent is our ‚Äúlibrary,‚Äù in whatever professional sense we assign that word, vitally connected to the discursive practices of the places from which it draws its mandate? We contend that vitalizing a library in this respect requires us to step outside the sphere of our habitual familiarity and to explore other places. How we go about doing this is a matter of methodology. If a prior conception of place interferes with the absorption of ethnomethods, it should be held in suspension, bracketed at least until the practitioner can grasp the place that already exists.","Placing the Library: An Argument for the Phenomenological and Constructivist Approach to the Human Geography of the Library","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2008","10.1086/528889","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2008-04-01,"2",78,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/528889","Thomas¬†Clay Templeton","The University of Chicago Press","en","195","209",NA,"library; librarianship; phenomenological; places; spaces; technology; birdsall; machine; phenomenological approach; people",4829,15,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",2000

Nazi ideological objections to foreign research were articulated in a series of laws and decrees that effectively prevented publicly accessible general state and university libraries from supplying foreign journals to their clientele. Technological university libraries, open to a smaller circle, grew in importance during the Reich both as collections and as agencies of dissemination to government and industry. Private industrial research libraries, using their own funds as well as the services of foreign subsidiaries, also flourished under the Nazis and profited from the additional dissemination services provided by the technological universities. The decline in general university libraries and the rise of industrial collections reflected the overall diversion of research under the Nazis from universities to the laboratories and proving grounds of industry.","German Libraries and Scientific and Technical Information in Nazi Germany","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1985","10.2307/4307835","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1985-04-01,"2",55,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4307835","Pamela Spence Richards","University of Chicago Press","eng","151","173",NA,"libraries; german; technological; foreign; technological university; research libraries; technical; documentation; nazi germany; universities",10034,23,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",1980

However, tutors can often experience significant issues with the support and management of student group work, and students can find group work difficult to manage and have very negative perceptions of group work. This paper examines LIS students' conceptions of group work as revealed through the students' drawings. Some 146 drawings of group work were collected from taught postgraduate and undergraduate students in an Information School. The drawings reveal a wide range of conceptions of group work, from very process- and tool-driven conceptions to more metaphorical conceptions of idea generation, puzzle, or a site of strength.

The comprehensive literature search, often supposed to be a necessary preliminary to a new research effort, is usually unnecessary in theory and often unnecessary in practice. Working familiarity with research areas from which potentially useful contributions are expected is sought in proportion to the expectation of impact of others' work on one's own. Use of original research reports is not indispensable and is often an inferior means of acquiring the desired familiarity.

The twenty-year span is intended to reflect the impact of feminism, the advent of automation, two-year master's programs, LIS doctoral programs, the 1972 accreditation standards, and faculty turnover. Primary sources of information are the 1971/72 directory issue of Journal of Education for Librarianship and the 1991/92 directory issue of Journal of Education for Library and Information Science, as well as library school catalogs. The sample comprises the entire population of full-time faculty in the seven currently accredited programs. Academic rank, doctorates held, and areas of teaching specialization are explored to identify differences between women and men. The findings indicate that the Canadian sex ratio, which is the reverse of the figures for North America in general, was the same in 1991/92 as in 1971/72. However, women and men have become more evenly distributed by rank and by area of teaching specialization.

Earnings functions are developed for men and women in public and academic libraries and for women in school libraries and are found to be statistically significantly different from one another. Personal, human capital, and job determinants of salaries for each group are identified. The differences in the earnings functions imply different reward structures in the various types of libraries. Salary differences by sex within library type are decomposed and found to be due primarily to differences in individual characteristics, but also to differences in the reward structures for men and women in the same type of library. A major economic theory of occupational segregation, supply-based human capital theory, is examined for its ability to explain the continuing predominance of women in the library profession and, within the profession, the disproportionate representation of men in academic libraries. The results are mixed. Demand-based institutional analysis is suggested as a possible alternative explanation.","Salary Determination and Occupational Segregation among Librarians","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1986","10.2307/4307967","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1986-04-01,"2",56,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4307967","Nancy A.

The Information Anxiety Scale (an adaptation of Sharon Bostick's 1992 'Library Anxiety Scale') was the pilot study's primary measure. Study researchers wanted to examine which information anxiety elements registered the most statistical significance for respondents. Analysis of results revealed statistically significant findings between elements in the scale and previous research and library experience, sex, and race/ethnicity.

Since their origins in the nineteenth century, American public libraries have relied almost exclusively on public funding. An examination of their nature as public goods, however, reveals public library services to be as much private goods as public goods. This conclusion based on economic grounds is supported by surveys of public opinion toward user fees in libraries, which have typically found the general public to be more tolerant of fees than librarians. In this study, we reanalyzed the data from a national telephone poll of 1,181 U.S. residents conducted in 1991 by the Library Research Center at the University of Illinois. When asked what they would like to see done if their local public library were facing a fiscal crisis, 47 percent of those voicing an opinion favored raising taxes, while 44 percent favored instituting user fees. The remaining 9 percent advocated a reduction in services. We used the framework of discrete choice analysis to determine whether attitudes toward fees and taxes stem more from citizens' own self-interest or more from their political outlook. We found greater support for self-interest as an explanation. In particular, more frequent library use, urban residence, a higher level of education, and greater income were all associated with a greater preference for taxes over fees or service cuts.","Public Opinion toward User Fees in Public Libraries","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1998","10.2307/4309202","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1998-04-01,"2",68,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4309202","Mark T.

Using naturalistic inquiry methodology, this article reports an empirical study of user-based relevance interpretations. A model is presented that reflects the nature of the thought processes of users who are evaluating bibliographic citations produced by a document retrieval system. Three major categories of variables affecting relevance assessments-internal context, external context, and problem context-are identified and described. Users' relevance assessments involve multiple layers of interpretations that are derived from individuals' experiences, perceptions, and private knowledge related to the particular information problems at hand.","The Nature of Relevance in Information Retrieval: An Empirical Study","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1993","10.2307/4308837","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1993-07-01,"3",63,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4308837","Taemin Kim Park","University of Chicago Press","eng","318","351",NA,"relevance; citation; relevance judgments; problem; problem area; subject; retrieval; research; context; library quarterly",15069,34,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",1990

This study examines the critical literacy performances of students in an online, asynchronous, graduate-level children's literature course using a qualitative approach to content analysis. The findings indicate that students performed critical literacy in four ways: (1) they unpacked the social identities and norms evident in the books, (2) considered characters and events from multiple viewpoints, (3) interrogated issues of power, authority, and agency and (4) analyzed the historical, cultural, and sociopolitical contexts of the books. While the findings reveal critical literacy can be enacted in the context of online courses, students' critically literate thinking was sometimes limited and superficial, suggesting students' understanding of critical literacy could be deepened with additional instruction and scaffolding.","Critical Literacy Performances in Online Literature Discussions","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","2016","10.2307/90015231","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2016-10-01,"4",57,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/90015231","Danielle E.

By the 1910s, the clubs were supporting approximately 250 members, publishing a newspaper called the S.E.G. News, and operating an acclaimed art pottery, the Paul Revere Pottery. Under the tutelage of Edith Guerrier, a librarian, her partner Edith Brown, an artist, and Helen Osborne Storrow, their financial patron, the clubs' meetings focused on weekly discussions of literature, economics, politics, music, art, and employment opportunities. Participation in these clubs enabled some of the members to pursue higher education at a significantly greater rate than their cohort, and indeed even that of native-born white women of the time period. Using rarely available primary documents, I examine the role clubs and social reform organizations played in advancing educational and economic agendas, and provide a rare look at the intellectual life of immigrant and working-class women.","The Saturday Evening Girls: A Progressive Era Library Club and the Intellectual Life of Working Class and Immigrant Girls in Turn-of-the-Century Boston","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2001","10.2307/4309506","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2001-04-01,"2",71,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4309506","Kate Clifford Larson","University of Chicago Press","eng","195","230",NA,"evening girls; guerrier; storrow; library; north bennet; pottery; boston; library clubs; immigrant; school",16470,36,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",2000

Studies have found, however, that in comparison with male librarians, female librarians tend to publish in disproportionately small numbers. One rationale offered for this discrepancy is that men receive the Ph.D. more frequently than do women (doctorate-holding librarians have been isolated as the most prolific writers). This study tests the hypothesis that men and women exhibit similar publishing patterns if education is held constant at the doctoral level. The population studied is limited to a random sample of library science Ph.D.s who received their degrees between 1969 and 1979. A list of each person's publications was compiled for the five-year period following receipt of the Ph.D. The citations are classified by gender, occupation, and type of publication and authorship. On the basis of this study, the hypothesis that men and women will exhibit similar publishing patterns cannot be rejected. The difference in the number of citations per person for equal numbers of men and women is insignificant. Differences between men and women when comparing type of publication, type of authorship, or quality of articles are also insignificant. There is, however, a significant difference between the number of unpublished women and the number of unpublished men; almost three times more women than men have no citations listed in ""Library Literature."" The hypothesis can be rejected when comparing male and female educators. The difference between mean number of citations per person as well as the difference between nonpublishing male and female educators is highly significant. Male educators publish almost twice as many works as do women. Female educators are almost six times as likely as male educators to have published nothing.","Comparison of the Publishing Patterns between Men and Women Ph.D.s in Librarianship","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1988","10.2307/4308196","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1988-01-01,"1",58,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4308196","Christine A.

We suggest that social contract theory provides the strongest argument for a right to access to information (and to have that information provided by public libraries). We argue, however, that the right to access to information is not unlimited. Limiting access (including censorship) is appropriate, for example, when such a limitation is necessary to protect a more fundamental right. Finally, we argue that the ALA's advocacy of an unlimited right to access is based on a mistaken understanding of what follows from the fact that all of our judgments are fallible.","The Ethical Presuppositions behind the Library Bill of Rights","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2000","10.2307/4309463","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2000-10-01,"4",70,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4309463","Martin Frick√©; Kay Mathiesen; Don Fallis","University of Chicago Press","eng","468","491",NA,"rights; access; libraries; censorship; public libraries; librarians; library bill; child pornography; presupposition; fallibilism",11189,24,"a4a20e2d-4e67-f67b-c64c-8a0212565202",2000

Professional guides to practice are predominantly prescriptive, advocating the avoidance of behaviors admittedly prevalent in practice. Adults and adolescents are congruent on what they want out of ideal encounters, but admit to stereotypical views of the other based on age and appearance. Service is found to be multidimensional, primarily clustered in very short interactions when classes change, more predominantly concerned with help with equipment, and less than half of what staff do in the high school library. An equal amount of time is allocated to enforcement activities, none of which is alluded to in professional guides to conduct.

The purpose of this study was to examine children's board books published between 2003 and 2008 to determine the representation of people of color. The findings were analyzed using the lenses of critical race theory and the typology developed by Rudine Sims Bishop to describe African American children's literature. The results indicated that, despite the increasing ethnic and racial diversity in the United States, board books that feature people of color are rare and often present inauthentic and monolithic representations. Even rarer seems to be the creation of board books by authors and illustrators of color.

Based on the findings, suggestions were made to improve the recruitment and retention of students of color, which will ultimately contribute to the ethnic/cultural diversity in librarianship.","Increasing Ethnic Diversity in LIS: Strategies Suggested by Librarians of Color","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2008","10.1086/528887","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2008-04-01,"2",78,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/528887","Kyung‚ÄêSun Kim; Sei‚ÄêChing¬†Joanna Sin","The University of Chicago Press","en","153","177",NA,"normalfont selectfont; portland xspace; empty declaremathsizes; xspace usepackage; ot2 normalfont; selectfont declaretextfontcommand; ot2 normalfont selectfont; normalfont selectfont declaretextfontcommand; document landscape; cyr renewcommand",9171,25,"ea8e83db-4157-2f48-80df-c49eca108ccc",2000

In 1850 he joined the Francis Hart Company in New York City as journeyman compositor and rose to partnership in 1858. Under De Vinne's management, Francis Hart & Company won the contract to print ""St. Nicholas"" in 1872, followed by ""Scribner's Monthly"" in 1876 (to become the ""Century Illustrated Monthly"" in 1881). After the death of Hart, De Vinne purchased the company in 1883 and it became Theodore L. De Vinne and Company until his retirement from direct control in 1908. At this time the company took the corporate name of the De Vinne Press, surviving as such until 1923. De Vinne pioneered in developing typographic style, as a type designer, a historian of printing and printing types, an adapter of new technology to fine printing, and an educator of the printing trade.

The associated ""rhizomorphic reading"" presupposes an active, sense-making reader who understands the significance of establishing connections, appreciating heterogeneity, affirming multiplicity, and validating and reincorporating rupture. After establishing characteristics of the aesthetics associated with two other book forms-the mirror aesthetic with the root-book, and the aesthetic of refabrication with the radicle-system book--we focus on discussion of the new hypertextual aesthetic associated with the rhizome book.

This article argues that although considerable efforts have been made by LIS professionals to meet the needs of minorities and underserved populations, a cultural competence framework is needed for these efforts to be successful. This article proposes a conceptual framework for developing cultural competence for LIS professionals and identifies three domains in which cultural competence is developed: cognitive, interpersonal, and environmental. The development of cultural competence within these domains is discussed, and essential elements needed to develop cultural competence within the domains are identified.","Cultural Competence: A Conceptual Framework for Library and Information Science Professionals","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2009","10.1086/597080","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2009-04-01,"2",79,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/597080","Patricia¬†Montiel Overall","The University of Chicago Press","en","175","204",NA,"cultural competence; lis professionals; underserved populations; library; culturally competent; diverse; lis profession; library use; library users; knowledge",9672,30,"284c5376-5c81-4da3-7f2c-a69053b33c64",2000

Their responses were compared with U.S. and Canadian government labor-force projections. The results revealed a complex interplay of gender relations in the students' perceptions of the occupational world and their roles within it. The results also revealed an interesting positioning of the job title ""librarian"" relative to other fields. Unlike their assessment of the other occupations included in the study, the students considerably underestimated the level of education required to be a librarian (most did not believe that librarians require a university education). They also underestimated librarians' average starting salary and rated the occupation's social status and future prospects to be lower than the other job titles. Taken together, the results indicate that young people beginning their university studies hold views about career prospects in the information sector that are consistent with some laborforce analysts' views of occupational winners and losers. The students see status, opportunity, and success to be attainable in fields such as computer engineering and systems analysis. Unfortunately, they view the occupational present and future for librarians in a somewhat dimmer light, a worrisome result in view of labor-force data that suggest reasonably strong salary and employment opportunities for this occupation in both the United States and Canada. The implications of these findings for library and information science (LIS) education are discussed in the context of gender and identity politics.","(Re)Positioning Librarians: How Young People View the Information Sector","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","2001","10.2307/40323997","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2001-10-01,"4",42,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40323997","Roma Harris; Margaret Ann Wilkinson","Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE)","eng","289","307",NA,"librarians; occupations; students; library; internet researcher; sector; announcer newscaster; education; computer engineer; librarianship",8757,19,"284c5376-5c81-4da3-7f2c-a69053b33c64",2000

Although he contended that he had discovered these principles, his ""five laws of library science,"" through a rigorous scientific process, it is clear that they and the concept of librarianship based on them are more fundamentally the product of Ranganathan's Hindu tradition. Ethical and metaphysical premises characteristic of Hinduism are reflected in his conception of the social and cosmic purpose of the library and of reference service as the basic means of fulfilling that purpose. Ranganathan believed that effective reference service depended on the intuitive ""flair"" of the librarian and on the use of an analyticosynthetic classification scheme. While the dependence of his concept of reference service on intuition lessened its practical value for American librarians, both his discussion of analyticosynthetic classification and the broad perspective from which he speaks are potentially important contributions to the understanding and practice of reference service in American libraries.","The Place of Reference Service in Ranganathan's Theory of Librarianship","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1976","10.2307/4306718","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1976-10-01,"4",46,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4306718","Marcia H.

In fall 1994, twenty-one students in an introductory course on communication processes completed analyses of fourteen different electronic lists or newsgroups as their term projects. Messages on each list or newsgroup were captured for approximately one month. Each message or partial message was described, in terms of its topic and its function, and frequencies were calculated. The topics most frequently discussed in each group were reasonably consistent with the group's stated purpose. In addition, technology topics were frequently discussed, as well as topics related to the library's clientele. The most common message functions were announcements, queries, and responses of various types. Comments made in the context of free-wheeling discussions also were common on some of the lists, but were rare on others. In addition to providing some baseline data on the topics and functions of messages in computer-mediated discussions, this study accomplished two pedagogical objectives: to introduce new students to electronic discussion groups as a channel for professional communication, and to introduce them to content analysis as a research method.","What's Everybody Talking about?: Message Functions and Topics on Electronic Lists and Newsgroups in Information and Library Science","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","1997","10.2307/40324217","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1997-04-01,"2",38,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40324217","Barbara M.

As we are perpetually working to increase racial and gender diversity in the profession, the definition of diversity continues to broaden to include socioeconomic status, education, language, literacy, age, sexual orientation, ability, geography, and much more. It is disheartening that the composition of our profession does not reflect the diverse patrons and communities that we serve. In preparing the next generation of librarians, LIS programs need to be able to groom culturally competent librarians who can serve these broadening communities. In this article, we urge LIS programs to develop the audacity and desire to experiment with their programs and saturate LIS education with elements of diversity and inclusion. We call for more dialogue in the form of symposia, panels, and discussions that will transform our LIS programs to be relevant to our communities.","Preparing Future Librarians to Effectively Serve Their Communities","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2013","10.1086/670699","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2013-07-01,"3",83,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/670699","Paul T.

That consensus was, in turn, the result of the general homogeneity of the people involved in the production and purchase of books for children. Agreement broke up in the mid-1960s, when groups heretofore unconcerned with children's books began to see their social and political implications. Enormous changes in the content of children's literature followed with some paradoxical shifts in liberal-conservative positions on censorship. The 1980s promises to be a period of conflict, as conservative reaction against the liberal trends of the 1970s tries to reverse an accomplished transformation in the literature.","Censorship and Children's Literature","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1983","10.2307/4307574","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1983-01-01,"1",53,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4307574","Anne Scott MacLeod","University of Chicago Press","eng","26","38",NA,"childrens books; children; adults; censorship; childhood; childrens literature; intellectual freedom; century; childrens reading; library quarterly",5730,13,"284c5376-5c81-4da3-7f2c-a69053b33c64",1980

Through searches in LISTA database that cross-referenced identity terms (e.g., Gender, LGBT) with terms describing prominent areas in the LIS field, we collected quantitative data and analyzed the co-occurrence of keywords and created network visualizations. We used a qualitative coding scheme to rate abstracts in terms of their relevance and actionability. Both modes of analysis show that generalized conversations about identity are most common, and praxis is rarely achieved. Using critical approaches to LIS, we explore the ramifications of silences within LIS literature upon the pedagogical and professional discourse.","Visualizing Identities in LIS Literature","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","2018","10.2307/90023014","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2018-03-01,"2-Jan",59,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/90023014","S.E.

If on-campus students are experiencing problems with feeling isolated, a lack of identity and feeling part of a community, then how do online students deal with these same issues? A research project conducted at Edith Cowan University in 2004-2005 sought to discover the issues affecting first year students and the problems they experienced when beginning studies in online professional education programs for librarians, library technicians, teacher librarians, archivists and records managers. An anonymous web survey and feedback from students were used to find out how the online environment differs from the on-campus experience, to examine students' emotional response to studying online and to facilitate a more supportive experience at university. This paper reports the results of online students' first year experiences and the use of discussion forums to create an online learning community.","Supporting First Year E-Learners in Courses for the Information Professions","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","2006","10.2307/40323820","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2006-10-01,"4",47,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40323820","Barbara Combes; Karen Anderson","Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE)","eng","259","276",NA,"students; online; online learning; discussion forums; forums; online students; anxiety; studying; studying online; confidence",8851,18,"284c5376-5c81-4da3-7f2c-a69053b33c64",2000

Camp Read-a-Rama, a summer day camp in South Carolina for 4- to 11-year-olds, creates innovative programming using childrenís literature as the springboard for all camp activities. Activities connect with and reinforce concepts in childrenís literature, thereby helping children learn to ìlive booksî and understand connections between their reading and their lives. For six summers (2009ñ2014), Camp Read-a-Rama has provided fully-engaged, week-long themed literacy immersion experiences that seek to turn ìsummer slideî into ìsummer stride.î The purposes of this longitudinal, mixed methods study were: (1) to ascertain the impact of Camp Read-a-Ramaís interventions on helping children develop positive attitudes toward reading; and (2) to determine best practices for literacy skill programming with children in libraries and the communities libraries serve. Findings offer compelling evidence that strategies employed through Camp Read-a-Rama programming positively impacted childrenís attitudes toward reading and their interactions with books, a critical step in literacy skill development and improvement. Analysis of parent/guardian evaluations revealed the following emerging themes as perceived impacts of Camp Read-a-Rama programming upon campers: increased love and enthusiasm for reading, improved reading and listening skills, and a belief that camp activities create a deeper understanding of books and vice versa. Findings suggest that integrating literacy skill instruction and programming into LIS curricula could better prepare librarians and LIS professionals to have a greater impact on literacy skill development among the children they serve.","Camp Read-a-RamaÆ and Fully-Engaged Literacy Learning","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","2016","10.2307/90015211","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2016-04-01,"2",57,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/90015211","Clayton A.

In turn, this can improve our relationships with one another, increasing empathy and respect, which can be reflected in numerous ways and is particularly important in a divisive political climate.","Creating Space at the Table","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2017","10.2307/26561755","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2017-10-01,"4",87,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/26561755","Shannon Oltmann","The University of Chicago Press","eng","410","418",NA,"intellectual freedom; library; diverse; diverse books; diversity; challenged books; library bill; library quarterly; diverse perspectives; american library",3675,9,"284c5376-5c81-4da3-7f2c-a69053b33c64",2010

Yet although librarians justify information literacy as increasing democratic participation by all citizens, their efforts to improve ""quality control"" of information also threaten to restrict choice in systematic ways. This contradiction results in part from the genealogy of the terms ""information"" and ""literacy,"" terms that share a relationship traceable to an Enlightenment ideology, namely, that reading could transform society by informing its people. But reading's power to transform was also a contested issue for groups seeking political and cultural ascendancy, and reading genres that initially challenged conventional thought evolved into those that buttressed it. In the process, some groups came to be defined as information ""consumers"" and simultaneously excluded from the role of information ""producers."" Strategies that can raise awareness of the assumptions underlying this legacy include critical analysis of language use and envisioning information use as a process that involves all users in both consumption and production. Adopting these can help librarians recognize that the tensions inherent in the discourse and practice of information literacy are not only unavoidable, but essential, if the basic condition of democracy--citizen participation--is to be fulfilled.","Information Literacy: A Contradictory Coupling","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2003","10.2307/4309685","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2003-10-01,"4",73,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4309685","Christine Pawley","University of Chicago Press","eng","422","452",NA,"literacy; librarians; library; library quarterly; discourse; knowledge; lis community; reading; social; materials",13329,31,"284c5376-5c81-4da3-7f2c-a69053b33c64",2000

The theoretical framework for the study draws on a constitutive view of communication, which acknowledges the construction of knowledge and identity in interaction within social situations. Within this framework, Foucault's theory of discursive formation makes it possible to understand poster graphics as discursive practice, while Scheff's theory of the social bond draws attention to the unforeseen consequences for both library users and library professionals of the world view created by such posters.","Unpacking Library Posters: A Theoretical Approach","Journal of Education for Library and Information Science","2001","10.2307/40324036","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2001-01-01,"1",42,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40324036","Nancy P.

As the concentration of media power in the hands of a small number of corporate entities increases and as market-driven management imperatives dominate publishing practices, students should possess the skills to evaluate effectively and critically mass media sources such as main-stream newspapers and magazines. To this end, a theoretical framework for understanding mass media news influence is offered. The concepts of agenda setting, priming, framing, asymmetrical selection, binary oppositionalism, and institutional hegemony are explored in a survey of relevant literature from the fields of journalism and communications. A teaching strategy incorporating these concepts is sketched out. The strategy highlights one news event, and compares how different news sources report that event. Through such an exercise, students will be able to recognize how different news frames affect understanding of the topic in question. Ultimately, the successful BI program will be defined by the extent to which students move away from a passive reading of news media sources to a position where they are able to decode the social context of mainstream news production and develop informed and negotiated reading practices.","Bibliographic Instruction and Mass Media News Literacy: A Theoretical Background","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1998","10.2307/4309247","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1998-10-01,"4",68,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4309247","Juris Dilevko","University of Chicago Press","eng","431","474",NA,"media news; news literacy; sources; agenda; library quarterly; media news literacy; television; dominance mediation; newspapers; coverage",19971,44,"284c5376-5c81-4da3-7f2c-a69053b33c64",1990

Some historians argue that the frontier forced the pioneers to revert to a near barbaric stage while it divested them of all aspects of their former cultures. Others maintain with equal vigor that the society which developed on each frontier was very nearly a carbon copy of the settled areas further east, and that the culture of Americans had not been significantly altered by the frontier process. Most agree, however, that evidence testifying to the nature and extent of book ownership provides one means of measuring the progress of culture on the frontier. This paper summarizes the results of an intensive study of this topic on the southern Indiana frontier. Data were collected from a variety of sources, but especially important were county probate records, which often contained inventories indicating books owned by early Indiana residents. An examination of over 2,000 inventories located in sixteen southern Indiana counties produced descriptions of more than 500 private libraries. An analysis of these libraries shows that the pattern of book ownership was not startingly different from that revealed by similar studies of book ownership in the American colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Clearly, books were not impossible to acquire in early Indiana, and a sizable proportion of the estates inventoried in the counties studied contained books. Most of the collections were small and narrowly religious in nature, with larger libraries still tending toward the utilitarian. However, a small number of inventories were discovered which listed large numbers of books; a few men--those with both the means and the inclination--built large and well-balanced libraries on the Indiana frontier.","Books on the Frontier: The Extent and Nature of Book Ownership in Southern Indiana, 1800-1850","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","1972","10.2307/4306206","article","research-article","jstor",NA,1972-10-01,"4",42,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4306206","Michael H.

Specifically, this study attempts to reframe issues surrounding the topic of cultural authenticity based on a systematic and empirical analysis of picture books that represent three different ethnic groups: African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanic Americans. A total of forty-five systematically selected picture books that represent fifteen books per ethnic group were selected and evaluated by multiple reviewers who were insiders of the culture. A coding scheme was developed to evaluate each book in terms of profile of major and minor characters, settings of the story, stereotypical features, and cultural authenticity. An in-depth evaluation of all selected books was added by a team of three reviewers in order to validate the results of the coded analysis. This study aims to shed light on library youth services and diversity education in a society with increasing ethnic diversity.","Evaluating Cultural Authenticity in Multicultural Picture Books: A Collaborative Analysis for Diversity Education","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2014","10.1086/676490","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2014-07-01,"3",84,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/676490","EunYoung Yoo-Lee; Lauren Fowler; Denice Adkins; Kyung-Sun Kim; Halima N.

Valuable Initiatives in Early Learning that Work Successfully (VIEWS2) was designed to test new ways to measure the effectiveness of these early literacy programs for young children (birth to kindergarten), leveraging a mixed methods, quasi-experimental design. Using two innovative tools, researchers collected data at 120 public library storytimes in the first year of research, observing approximately 1,440 children ranging from birth to 60 months of age. Analysis of year-one data showed a correlation between the early literacy content of the storytime program and children's outcomes in terms of early literacy behaviors. These findings demonstrate that young children who attend public library storytimes are responding to the early literacy content in the storytime programs.","Early Literacy in Library Storytimes","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2016","10.2307/26561687","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2016-10-01,"4",86,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/26561687","Kathleen Campana; J.

Although librarianship is a female‚Äêintensive profession, 63.4 percent of the obituaries chronicled the lives of male librarians. Although public and school librarians outnumber their academic counterparts, obituaries focused on academic librarians. Far from creating a stereotypical portrait of librarians as shy, dour, dowdy, and sheltered individuals, the emphasis on large‚Äêscale achievements in the obituaries produces an image of librarianship as a glamorous profession. Some librarians are presented as sleuths and detectives who amassed large collections. They contributed to the progress of scholarly research with extensive publications. Many others had connections to prominent people, making the most of these social networks in their work. Librarians were also players on the global stage, founding libraries abroad and developing international guidelines that led to institutional progress. Emphasis on large‚Äêscale accomplishment, however, tends to obscure the contributions of librarians who daily perform countless small and caring acts that, summed together, positively affect the lives of ordinary individuals.","The Portrayal of Librarians in Obituaries at the End of the Twentieth Century","The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy","2004","10.1086/382845","article","research-article","jstor",NA,2004-04-01,"2",74,"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/382845","Juris Dilevko; Lisa Gottlieb","The University of Chicago Press","en","152","180",NA,"librarians; obituaries; library; librarianship; nyt obituaries; obituary subjects; normalfont selectfont; rare books; collection; public library",10708,29,"284c5376-5c81-4da3-7f2c-a69053b33c64",2000
